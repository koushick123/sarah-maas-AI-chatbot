{"_default": {"1": {"Name": "PART I THE HOLLOW-Chapter 1", "Page Content": " \nThere was a wolf at the gallery door.\nWhich meant it must be Thursday, which meant Bryce had to be really\ngods-damned tired if she relied on Danika\u2019s comings and goings to figure\nout what day it was.\nThe heavy metal door to Griffin Antiquities thudded with the impact of\nthe wolf\u2019s fist\u2014a fist that Bryce knew ended in metallic-purple painted\nnails in dire need of a manicure. A heartbeat later, a female voice barked,\nhalf-muffled through the steel, \u201cOpen the Hel up, B. It\u2019s hot as shit out\nhere!\u201d\nSeated at the desk in the modest gallery showroom, Bryce smirked and\npulled up the front door\u2019s video feed. Tucking a strand of her wine-red hair\nbehind a pointed ear, she asked into the intercom, \u201cWhy are you covered in\ndirt? You look like you\u2019ve been rootling through the garbage.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the fuck does rootling mean?\u201d Danika hopped from foot to foot,\nsweat gleaming on her brow. She wiped at it with a filthy hand, smearing\nthe black liquid splattered there.\n\u201cYou\u2019d know if you ever picked up a book, Danika.\u201d Glad for the\nbreak in what had been a morning of tedious research, Bryce smiled as she\nrose from the desk. With no exterior windows, the gallery\u2019s extensive\nsurveillance equipment served as her only warning of who stood beyond its\nthick walls. Even with her sharp half-Fae hearing, she couldn\u2019t make out\nmuch beyond the iron door save for the occasional banging fist. The\nbuilding\u2019s unadorned sandstone walls belied the latest tech and grade A\nspellwork that kept it operational and preserved many of the books in the\narchives below.\nAs if merely thinking about the level beneath Bryce\u2019s high heels had\nsummoned her, a little voice asked from behind the six-inch-thick archives\ndoor to her left, \u201cIs that Danika?\u201d\n\u201cYes, Lehabah.\u201d Bryce wrapped her hand around the front door\u2019s\nhandle. The enchantments on it hummed against her palm, slithering like\nsmoke over her freckled golden skin. She gritted her teeth and withstood it,\nstill unused to the sensation even after a year of working at the gallery.\nFrom the other side of the deceptively simple metal door to the\narchives, Lehabah warned, \u201cJesiba doesn\u2019t like her in here.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t like her in here,\u201d Bryce amended, her amber eyes\nnarrowing toward the archives door and the tiny fire sprite she knew was\nhovering just on the other side, eavesdropping as she always did whenever\nsomeone stood out front. \u201cGo back to work.\u201d\nLehabah didn\u2019t answer, presumably drifting back downstairs to guard\nthe books below. Rolling her eyes, Bryce yanked open the front door,\ngetting a face full of heat so dry it threatened to suck the life from her. And\nsummer had only just begun.\nDanika didn\u2019t just look like she\u2019d been rootling through the garbage.\nShe smelled like it, too.\nWisps of her silvery blond hair\u2014normally a straight, silken sheet\u2014\ncurled from her tight, long braid, the streaks of amethyst, sapphire, and rose\nsplattered with some dark, oily substance that reeked of metal and\nammonia.\n\u201cTook you long enough,\u201d Danika groused, and swaggered into the\ngallery, the sword strapped at her back bobbing with each step. Her braid\nhad become tangled in its worn leather hilt, and as she stopped before the\ndesk, Bryce took the liberty of prying the plait free.\nShe\u2019d barely untangled it before Danika\u2019s slim fingers were\nunbuckling the straps that kept the sword sheathed across her worn leather\nmotorcycle jacket. \u201cI need to dump this here for a few hours,\u201d she said,\npulling the sword off her back and aiming for the supply closet hidden\nbehind a wooden panel across the showroom.\nBryce leaned against the lip of the desk and crossed her arms, fingers\nbrushing against the stretchy black fabric of her skintight dress. \u201cYour gym\nbag\u2019s already stinking up the place. Jesiba\u2019s due back later this afternoon\u2014\nshe\u2019ll throw your shit in the dumpster again if it\u2019s still here.\u201d\nIt was the mildest Hel Jesiba Roga could unleash if provoked.\nA four-hundred-year-old enchantress who\u2019d been born a witch and\ndefected, Jesiba had joined the House of Flame and Shadow and now\nanswered only to the Under-King himself. Flame and Shadow suited her\nwell\u2014she possessed an arsenal of spells to rival any sorcerer or\nnecromancer in the darkest of the Houses. She\u2019d been known to change\npeople into animals when irritated enough. Bryce had never dared ask if the\nsmall animals in the dozen tanks and terrariums had always been animals.\nAnd Bryce tried never to irritate her. Not that there were any safe sides\nwhen the Vanir were involved. Even the least powerful of the Vanir\u2014a\ngroup that covered every being on Midgard aside from humans and\nordinary animals\u2014could be deadly.\n\u201cI\u2019ll get it later,\u201d Danika promised, pushing on the hidden panel to\nspring it open. Bryce had warned her three times now that the showroom\nsupply closet wasn\u2019t her personal locker. Yet Danika always countered that\nthe gallery, located in the heart of the Old Square, was more centrally\nlocated than the wolves\u2019 Den over in Moonwood. And that was that.\nThe supply closet opened, and Danika waved a hand in front of her\nface. \u201cMy gym bag\u2019s stinking up the place?\u201d With a black boot, she toed the\nsagging duffel that held Bryce\u2019s dance gear, currently wedged between the\nmop and bucket. \u201cWhen the fuck did you last wash those clothes?\u201d\nBryce wrinkled her nose at the reek of old shoes and sweaty clothing\nthat wafted out. Right\u2014she\u2019d forgotten to bring home the leotard and tights\nto wash after a lunchtime class two days ago. Mostly thanks to Danika\nsending her a video of a heap of mirthroot on their kitchen counter, music\nalready blasting from the beat-up boom box by the windows, along with a\ncommand to hurry home quick. Bryce had obeyed. They\u2019d smoked enough\nthat there was a good chance Bryce had still been high yesterday morning\nwhen she\u2019d stumbled into work.\nThere was really no other explanation for why it had taken ten minutes\nto type out a two-sentence email that day. Letter by letter.\n\u201cNever mind that,\u201d Bryce said. \u201cI have a bone to pick with you.\u201d\nDanika rearranged the crap in the closet to make space for her own. \u201cI\ntold you I was sorry I ate your leftover noodles. I\u2019ll buy you more tonight.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that, dumbass, though again: fuck you. That was my lunch for\ntoday.\u201d Danika chuckled. \u201cThis tattoo hurts like Hel,\u201d Bryce complained. \u201cI\ncan\u2019t even lean against my chair.\u201d\nDanika countered in a singsong voice, \u201cThe artist warned you it\u2019d be\nsore for a few days.\u201d\n\u201cI was so drunk I spelled my name wrong on the waiver. I\u2019d hardly say\nI was in a good place to understand what \u2018sore for a few days\u2019 meant.\u201d\nDanika, who\u2019d gotten a matching tattoo of the text now scrolling down\nBryce\u2019s back, had already healed. One of the benefits to being a full-\nblooded Vanir: swift recovery time compared to humans\u2014or a half-human\nlike Bryce.\nDanika shoved her sword into the mess of the closet. \u201cI promise I\u2019ll\nhelp you ice your sore back tonight. Just let me take a shower and I\u2019ll be out\nof here in ten.\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t unusual for her friend to pop into the gallery, especially on\nThursdays, when her morning patrol ended just a few blocks away, but\nshe\u2019d never used the full bathroom in the archives downstairs. Bryce\nmotioned to the dirt and grease. \u201cWhat is that on you?\u201d\nDanika scowled, the angular planes of her face scrunching. \u201cI had to\nbreak up a fight between a satyr and a nightstalker.\u201d She bared her white\nteeth at the black substance crusting her hands. \u201cGuess which one spewed\nits juices onto me.\u201d\nBryce snorted and gestured to the archives door. \u201cShower\u2019s yours.\nThere are some clean clothes in the bottom drawer of the desk down there.\u201d\nDanika\u2019s filthy fingers began pulling the handle of the archives door.\nHer jaw tightened, the older tattoo on her neck\u2014the horned, grinning wolf\nthat served as the sigil for the Pack of Devils\u2014rippling with tension.\nNot from the effort, Bryce realized as she noted Danika\u2019s stiff back.\nBryce glanced to the supply closet, which Danika had not bothered to shut.\nThe sword, famed both in this city and far beyond it, leaned against the\npush broom and mop, its ancient leather scabbard nearly obscured by the\nfull container of gasoline used to fuel the electric generator out back.\nBryce had always wondered why Jesiba bothered with an old-\nfashioned generator\u2014until the citywide firstlight outage last week. When\nthe power had failed, only the generator had kept the mechanical locks in\nplace during the looting that followed, when creeps had rushed in from the\nMeat Market, bombarding the gallery\u2019s front door with counterspells to\nbreak through the enchantments.\nBut\u2014Danika ditching the sword in the office. Danika needing to take a\nshower. Her stiff back.\nBryce asked, \u201cYou\u2019ve got a meeting with the City Heads?\u201d\nIn the five years since they\u2019d met as freshmen at Crescent City\nUniversity, Bryce could count on one hand the number of times Danika had\nbeen called in for a meeting with the seven people important enough to\nmerit a shower and change of clothes. Even while delivering reports to\nDanika\u2019s grandfather, the Prime of the Valbaran wolves, and to Sabine, her\nmother, Danika usually wore that leather jacket, jeans, and whatever vintage\nband T-shirt wasn\u2019t dirty.\nOf course, it pissed off Sabine to no end, but everything about Danika\n\u2014and Bryce\u2014pissed off the Alpha of the Scythe Moon Pack, chief among\nthe shifter units in the city\u2019s Auxiliary.\nIt didn\u2019t matter that Sabine was the Prime Apparent of the Valbaran\nwolves and had been her aging father\u2019s heir for centuries, or that Danika\nwas officially second in line to the title. Not when whispers had swirled for\nyears that Danika should be tapped to be the Prime Apparent, bypassing her\nmother. Not when the old wolf had given his granddaughter their family\u2019s\nheirloom sword after centuries of promising it to Sabine only upon his\ndeath. The blade had called to Danika on her eighteenth birthday like a\nhowl on a moonlit night, the Prime had said to explain his unexpected\ndecision.\nSabine had never forgotten that humiliation. Especially when Danika\ncarried the blade nearly everywhere\u2014especially in front of her mother.\nDanika paused in the gaping archway, atop the green carpeted steps\nthat led down to the archives beneath the gallery\u2014where the true treasure\nin this place lay, guarded by Lehabah day and night. It was the real reason\nwhy Danika, who\u2019d been a history major at CCU, liked to drop by so often,\njust to browse the ancient art and books, despite Bryce\u2019s teasing about her\nreading habits.\nDanika turned, her caramel eyes shuttered. \u201cPhilip Briggs is being\nreleased today.\u201d\nBryce started. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re letting him go on some gods-damned technicality. Someone\nfucked up the paperwork. We\u2019re getting the full update in the meeting.\u201d She\nclenched her slim jaw, the glow from the firstlights in the glass sconces\nalong the stairwell bouncing off her dirty hair. \u201cIt\u2019s so fucked up.\u201d\nBryce\u2019s stomach churned. The human rebellion remained confined to\nthe northern reaches of Pangera, the sprawling territory across the Haldren\nSea, but Philip Briggs had done his best to bring it over to Valbara. \u201cYou\nand the pack busted him right in his little rebel bomb lab, though.\u201d\nDanika tapped her booted foot on the green carpet. \u201cBureaucratic\nfucking nonsense.\u201d\n\u201cHe was going to blow up a club. You literally found his blueprints for\nblowing up the White Raven.\u201d As one of the most popular nightclubs in the\ncity, the loss of life would have been catastrophic. Briggs\u2019s previous\nbombings had been smaller, but no less deadly, all designed to trigger a war\nbetween the humans and Vanir to match the one raging in Pangera\u2019s colder\nclimes. Briggs made no secret of his goal: a global conflict that would cost\nthe lives of millions on either side. Lives that were expendable if it meant a\npossibility for humans to overthrow those who oppressed them\u2014the\nmagically gifted and long-lived Vanir and, above them, the Asteri, who\nruled the planet Midgard from the Eternal City in Pangera.\nBut Danika and the Pack of Devils had stopped the plot. She\u2019d busted\nBriggs and his top supporters, all part of the Keres rebels, and spared\ninnocents from their brand of fanaticism.\nAs one of the most elite shifter units in Crescent City\u2019s Auxiliary, the\nPack of Devils patrolled the Old Square, making sure drunken, handsy\ntourists didn\u2019t become drunken, dead tourists when they approached the\nwrong person. Making sure the bars and caf\u00e9s and music halls and shops\nstayed safe from whatever lowlife had crawled into town that day. And\nmaking sure people like Briggs were in prison.\nThe 33rd Imperial Legion claimed to do the same, but the angels who\nmade up the fabled ranks of the Governor\u2019s personal army just glowered\nand promised Hel if challenged.\n\u201cBelieve me,\u201d Danika said, stomping down the stairs, \u201cI\u2019m going to\nmake it perfectly fucking clear in this meeting that Briggs\u2019s release is\nunacceptable.\u201d\nShe would. Even if Danika had to snarl in Micah Domitus\u2019s face, she\u2019d\nget her point across. There weren\u2019t many who\u2019d dare piss off the Archangel\nof Crescent City, but Danika wouldn\u2019t hesitate. And given that all seven\nHeads of the City would be at this meeting, the odds of that happening were\nhigh. Things tended to escalate swiftly when they were in one room. There\nwas little love lost between the six lower Heads in Crescent City, the\nmetropolis formally known as Lunathion. Each Head controlled a specific\npart of the city: the Prime of the wolves in Moonwood, the Fae Autumn\nKing in Five Roses, the Under-King in the Bone Quarter, the Viper Queen\nin the Meat Market, the Oracle in the Old Square, and the River Queen\u2014\nwho very rarely made an appearance\u2014representing the House of Many\nWaters and her Blue Court far beneath the Istros River\u2019s turquoise surface.\nShe seldom deigned to leave it.\nThe humans in Asphodel Meadows had no Head. No seat at the table.\nPhilip Briggs had found more than a few sympathizers because of it.\nBut Micah, Head of the Central Business District, ruled over them all.\nBeyond his city titles, he was Archangel of Valbara. Ruler of this entire\nfucking territory, and answerable only to the six Asteri in the Eternal City,\nthe capital and beating heart of Pangera. Of the entire planet of Midgard. If\nanyone could keep Briggs in prison, it would be him.\nDanika reached the bottom of the stairs, so far below that she was cut\noff from sight by the slope of the ceiling. Bryce lingered in the archway,\nlistening as Danika said, \u201cHey, Syrinx.\u201d A little yip of delight from the\nthirty-pound chimera rose up the stairs.\nJesiba had purchased the Lower creature two months ago, to Bryce\u2019s\ndelight. He is not a pet, Jesiba had warned her. He\u2019s an expensive, rare\ncreature bought for the sole purpose of assisting Lehabah in guarding these\nbooks. Do not interfere with his duties.\nBryce had so far failed to inform Jesiba that Syrinx was more\ninterested in eating, sleeping, and getting belly rubs than monitoring the\nprecious books. No matter that her boss might see that at any point, should\nshe bother to check the dozens of camera feeds in the library.\nDanika drawled, the smirk audible in her voice, \u201cWhat\u2019s got your\npanties in a twist, Lehabah?\u201d\nThe fire sprite grumbled, \u201cI don\u2019t wear panties. Or clothes. They don\u2019t\npair well when you\u2019re made of flame, Danika.\u201d\nDanika snickered. Before Bryce could decide whether to go downstairs\nto referee the match between the fire sprite and the wolf, the phone on the\ndesk began ringing. She had a good idea who it would be.\nHeels sinking into the plush carpeting, Bryce reached the phone before\nit went to audiomail, sparing herself a five-minute lecture. \u201cHi, Jesiba.\u201d\nA beautiful, lilting female voice answered, \u201cPlease tell Danika Fendyr\nthat if she continues to use the supply closet as her own personal locker, I\nwill turn her into a lizard.\u201d"}, "2": {"Name": "PART I THE HOLLOW-Chapter 2", "Page Content": " \nBy the time Danika emerged on the gallery\u2019s showroom floor, Bryce had\nendured a mildly threatening reprimand from Jesiba about her ineptitude,\none email from a fussy client demanding Bryce expedite the paperwork on\nthe ancient urn she\u2019d bought so she could show it off to her equally fussy\nfriends at her cocktail party on Monday, and two messages from members\nof Danika\u2019s pack inquiring about whether their Alpha was about to kill\nsomeone over Briggs\u2019s release.\nNathalie, Danika\u2019s Third, had gotten straight to the point: Has she lost\nher shit about Briggs yet?\nConnor Holstrom, Danika\u2019s Second, took a little more care with what\nhe sent out into the ether. There was always a chance of a leak. Have you\nspoken to Danika? was all he\u2019d asked.\nBryce was writing back to Connor\u2014Yes. I\u2019ve got it covered\u2014when a\ngray wolf the size of a small horse pushed the iron archives door shut with a\npaw, claws clicking on the metal.\n\u201cYou hated my clothes that much?\u201d Bryce asked, rising from her seat.\nOnly Danika\u2019s caramel eyes remained the same in this form\u2014and only\nthose eyes softened the pure menace and grace the wolf radiated with each\nstep toward the desk.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got them on, don\u2019t worry.\u201d Long, sharp fangs flashed with each\nword. Danika cocked her fuzzy ears, taking in the computer that had been\nshut down, the purse Bryce had set on the desk. \u201cYou\u2019re coming out with\nme?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to do some sleuthing for Jesiba.\u201d Bryce grabbed the ring of\nkeys that opened doors into various parts of her life. \u201cShe\u2019s been hounding\nme about finding Luna\u2019s Horn again. As if I haven\u2019t been trying to find it\nnonstop for the last week.\u201d\nDanika glanced to one of the visible cameras in the showroom,\nmounted behind a decapitated statue of a dancing faun dating back ten\nthousand years. Her bushy tail swished once. \u201cWhy does she even want it?\u201d\nBryce shrugged. \u201cI haven\u2019t had the balls to ask.\u201d\nDanika stalked to the front door, careful not to let her claws snag a\nsingle thread in the carpet. \u201cI doubt she\u2019s going to return it to the temple out\nof the goodness of her heart.\u201d\n\u201cI have a feeling Jesiba would leverage its return to her advantage,\u201d\nBryce said. They strode onto the quiet street a block off the Istros, the\nmidday sun baking the cobblestones, Danika a solid wall of fur and muscle\nbetween Bryce and the curb.\nThe theft of the sacred horn during the power outage had been the\nbiggest news story out of the disaster: looters had used the cover of\ndarkness to break into Luna\u2019s Temple and swipe the ancient Fae relic from\nits resting place atop the lap of the massive, enthroned deity.\nThe Archangel Micah himself had offered a hefty reward for any\ninformation regarding its return and promised that the sacrilegious bastard\nwho\u2019d stolen it would be brought to justice.\nAlso known as public crucifixion.\nBryce always made a point of not going near the square in the CBD,\nwhere they were usually held. On certain days, depending on the wind and\nheat, the smell of blood and rotting flesh could carry for blocks.\nBryce fell into step beside Danika as the massive wolf scanned the\nstreet, nostrils sniffing for any hint of a threat. Bryce, as half-Fae, could\nscent people in greater detail than the average human. She\u2019d entertained her\nparents endlessly as a kid by describing the scents of everyone in their little\nmountain town, Nidaros\u2014humans possessed no such way to interpret the\nworld. But her abilities had nothing on her friend\u2019s.\nAs Danika scented the street, her tail wagged once\u2014and not from\nhappiness.\n\u201cChill,\u201d Bryce said. \u201cYou\u2019ll make your case to the Heads, then they\u2019ll\nfigure it out.\u201d\nDanika\u2019s ears flattened. \u201cIt\u2019s all fucked, B. All of it.\u201d\nBryce frowned. \u201cYou really mean to tell me that any of the Heads want\na rebel like Briggs at large? They\u2019ll find some technicality and throw his ass\nright back in jail.\u201d She added, because Danika still wouldn\u2019t look at her,\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way the 33rd\u2019s not monitoring his every breath. Briggs so much\nas blinks wrong and he\u2019ll see what kind of pain angels can rain down on us\nall. Hel, the Governor might even send the Umbra Mortis after him.\u201d\nMicah\u2019s personal assassin, with the rare gift of lightning in his veins, could\neliminate almost any threat.\nDanika snarled, teeth gleaming. \u201cI can handle Briggs myself.\u201d\n\u201cI know you can. Everyone knows you can, Danika.\u201d\nDanika surveyed the street ahead, glancing past a poster of the six\nenthroned Asteri tacked up on a wall\u2014with an empty throne to honor their\nfallen sister\u2014but loosed a breath.\nShe would always have burdens and expectations to shoulder that\nBryce would never have to endure, and Bryce was thankful as Hel for that\nprivilege. When Bryce fucked up, Jesiba usually griped for a few minutes\nand that was that. When Danika fucked up, it was blasted on news reports\nand across the interweb.\nSabine made sure of it.\nBryce and Sabine had hated each other from the moment the Alpha\nhad sneered at her only child\u2019s improper, half-breed roommate that first day\nat CCU. And Bryce had loved Danika from the moment her new roommate\nhad offered her a hand in greeting anyway, and then said Sabine was just\npissy because she\u2019d been hoping for a muscle-bound vampyr to drool over.\nDanika rarely let the opinions of others\u2014especially Sabine\u2014eat away\nat her swagger and joy, yet on rough days like this \u2026 Bryce lifted a hand\nand ran it down Danika\u2019s muscled ribs, a comforting, sweeping stroke.\n\u201cDo you think Briggs will come after you or the pack?\u201d Bryce asked,\nher stomach twisting. Danika hadn\u2019t busted Briggs alone\u2014he had a score to\nsettle with all of them.\nDanika\u2019s snout wrinkled. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\nThe words echoed between them. In hand-to-hand combat, Briggs\nwould never survive against Danika. But one of those bombs would change\neverything. If Danika had made the Drop into immortality, she\u2019d probably\nsurvive. But since she hadn\u2019t\u2014since she was the only one of the Pack of\nDevils who hadn\u2019t yet done it \u2026 Bryce\u2019s mouth turned dry.\n\u201cBe careful,\u201d Bryce said quietly.\n\u201cI will,\u201d Danika said, her warm eyes still full of shadows. But then she\ntossed her head, as if shaking it free of water\u2014the movement purely canine.\nBryce often marveled at this, that Danika could clear away her fears, or at\nleast bury them, enough to move onward. Indeed, Danika changed the\nsubject. \u201cYour brother will be at the meeting today.\u201d\nHalf brother. Bryce didn\u2019t bother to correct her. Half brother and full-\nFae prick. \u201cAnd?\u201d\n\u201cJust thought I\u2019d warn you that I\u2019ll be seeing him.\u201d The wolf\u2019s face\nsoftened slightly. \u201cHe\u2019s going to ask me how you\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\u201cTell Ruhn I\u2019m busy doing important shit and to go to Hel.\u201d\nDanika huffed a laugh. \u201cWhere, exactly, are you doing this sleuthing\nfor the Horn?\u201d\n\u201cThe temple,\u201d Bryce said with a sigh. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019ve been looking\ninto this thing for days on end, and can\u2019t figure out anything. No suspects,\nno murmurings at the Meat Market about it being for sale, no motive for\nwho\u2019d even bother with it. It\u2019s famous enough that whoever\u2019s got it has it\nwrapped up tight.\u201d She frowned at the clear sky. \u201cI almost wonder if the\npower outage was tied to it\u2014if someone shut down the city\u2019s grid to steal it\nin the chaos. There are about twenty people in this city capable of being that\ncrafty, and half of them possess the resources to pull it off.\u201d\nDanika\u2019s tail twitched. \u201cIf they\u2019re able to do something like that, I\u2019d\nsuggest staying away. Lead Jesiba around a bit, make her think you\u2019re\nlooking for it, and then let it drop. Either the Horn will show up by then, or\nshe\u2019ll move on to her next stupid quest.\u201d\nBryce admitted, \u201cI just \u2026 It\u2019d be good to find the Horn. For my own\ncareer.\u201d Whatever the Hel that would be. A year of working at the gallery\nhadn\u2019t sparked anything beyond disgust at the obscene amounts of money\nthat rich people squandered on old-ass shit.\nDanika\u2019s eyes flickered. \u201cYeah, I know.\u201d\nBryce zipped a tiny golden pendant\u2014a knot of three entwined circles\n\u2014along the delicate chain around her neck.\nDanika went on patrol armed with claws, a sword, and guns, but\nBryce\u2019s daily armor consisted solely of this: an Archesian amulet barely the\nsize of her thumbnail, gifted by Jesiba on the first day of work.\nA hazmat suit in a necklace, Danika had marveled when Bryce had\nshown off the amulet\u2019s considerable protections against the influence of\nvarious magical objects. Archesian amulets didn\u2019t come cheap, but Bryce\ndidn\u2019t bother to delude herself into thinking her boss\u2019s gift was given out of\nanything but self-interest. It would have been an insurance nightmare if\nBryce didn\u2019t have one.\nDanika nodded to the necklace. \u201cDon\u2019t take that off. Especially if\nyou\u2019re looking into shit like the Horn.\u201d Even though the Horn\u2019s mighty\npowers had long been dead\u2014if it had been stolen by someone powerful,\nshe\u2019d need every magical defense against them.\n\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d Bryce said, though Danika was right. She\u2019d never taken\nthe necklace off since getting it. If Jesiba ever kicked her to the curb, she\nknew she\u2019d have to find some way to make sure the necklace came with\nher. Danika had said as much several times, unable to stop that Alpha wolf\u2019s\ninstinct to protect at all costs. It was part of why Bryce loved her\u2014and why\nher chest tightened in that moment with that same love and gratitude.\nBryce\u2019s phone buzzed in her purse, and she fished it out. Danika\npeered over, noted who was calling, and wagged her tail, ears perking up.\n\u201cDo not say a word about Briggs,\u201d Bryce warned, and accepted the\ncall. \u201cHi, Mom.\u201d\n\u201cHey, sweetie.\u201d Ember Quinlan\u2019s clear voice filled her ear, drawing a\nsmile from Bryce even with three hundred miles between them. \u201cI wanted\nto double-check that next weekend is still okay to visit.\u201d\n\u201cHi, Mommy!\u201d Danika barked toward the phone.\nEmber laughed. Ember had always been Mom to Danika, even from\ntheir first meeting. And Ember, who had never borne any children beyond\nBryce, had been more than glad to find herself with a second\u2014equally\nwillful and troublesome\u2014daughter. \u201cDanika\u2019s with you?\u201d\nBryce rolled her eyes and held out the phone to her friend. Between\none step and the next, Danika shifted in a flash of light, the massive wolf\nshrinking into the lithe humanoid form.\nSnatching the phone from Bryce, Danika pinned it between her ear and\nshoulder as she adjusted the white silk blouse Bryce had loaned her, tucking\nit into her stained jeans. She\u2019d managed to wipe a good amount of the\nnightstalker gunk off both the pants and leather jacket, but the T-shirt had\napparently been a lost cause. Danika said into the phone, \u201cBryce and I are\ntaking a walk.\u201d\nWith Bryce\u2019s arched ears, she could hear her mother perfectly as she\nsaid, \u201cWhere?\u201d\nEmber Quinlan made overprotectiveness a competitive sport.\nMoving here, to Lunathion, had been a test of wills. Ember had only\nrelented when she\u2019d learned who Bryce\u2019s freshman-year roommate was\u2014\nand then gave Danika a lecture on how to make sure Bryce stayed safe.\nRandall, Bryce\u2019s stepfather, had mercifully cut his wife off after thirty\nminutes.\nBryce knows how to defend herself, Randall had reminded Ember. We\nsaw to that. And Bryce will keep up her training while she\u2019s here, won\u2019t\nshe?\nBryce certainly had. She\u2019d hit up the gun range just a few days ago,\ngoing through the motions Randall\u2014her true father, as far as she was\nconcerned\u2014had taught her since childhood: assembling a gun, taking aim\nat a target, controlling her breathing.\nMost days, she found guns to be brutal killing machines, and felt\ngrateful that they were highly regulated by the Republic. But given that she\nhad little more to defend herself beyond speed and a few well-placed\nmaneuvers, she\u2019d learned that for a human, a gun could mean the difference\nbetween life and slaughter.\nDanika fibbed, \u201cWe\u2019re just heading to one of the hawker stalls in the\nOld Square\u2014we wanted some lamb kofta.\u201d\nBefore Ember could continue the interrogation, Danika added, \u201cHey, B\nmust have forgotten to tell you that we\u2019re actually heading down to Kalaxos\nnext weekend\u2014Ithan\u2019s got a sunball game there, and we\u2019re all going to\ncheer him on.\u201d\nA half-truth. The game was happening, but there had been no\ndiscussion of going to watch Connor\u2019s younger brother, CCU\u2019s star player.\nThis afternoon, the Pack of Devils was actually heading over to the CCU\narena to cheer for Ithan, but Bryce and Danika hadn\u2019t bothered to attend an\naway game since sophomore year, when Danika had been sleeping with one\nof the defensemen.\n\u201cThat\u2019s too bad,\u201d Ember said. Bryce could practically hear the frown\nin her mother\u2019s tone. \u201cWe were really looking forward to it.\u201d\nBurning Solas, this woman was a master of the guilt trip. Bryce\ncringed and snatched back the phone. \u201cSo were we, but let\u2019s reschedule for\nnext month.\u201d\n\u201cBut that\u2019s so long from now\u2014\u201d\n\u201cShit, a client\u2019s coming down the street,\u201d Bryce lied. \u201cI gotta go.\u201d\n\u201cBryce Adelaide Quinlan\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBye, Mom.\u201d\n\u201cBye, Mom!\u201d Danika echoed, just as Bryce hung up.\nBryce sighed toward the sky, ignoring the angels soaring and flapping\npast, their shadows dancing over the sun-washed streets. \u201cMessage\nincoming in three, two \u2026\u201d\nHer phone buzzed.\nEmber had written, If I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d think you were avoiding\nus, Bryce. Your father will be very hurt.\nDanika let out a whistle. \u201cOh, she\u2019s good.\u201d\nBryce groaned. \u201cI\u2019m not letting them come to the city if Briggs is\nrunning free.\u201d\nDanika\u2019s smile faded. \u201cI know. We\u2019ll keep pushing them off until it\u2019s\nsorted out.\u201d Thank Cthona for Danika\u2014she always had a plan for\neverything.\nBryce slid her phone into her purse, leaving her mother\u2019s message\nunanswered.\nWhen they reached the Gate at the heart of the Old Square, its quartz\narchway as clear as a frozen pond, the sun was just hitting its upper edge,\nrefracting and casting small rainbows against one of the buildings flanking\nit. On Summer Solstice, when the sun lined up perfectly with the Gate, it\nfilled the entire square with rainbows, so many that it was like walking\ninside a diamond.\nTourists milled about, a line of them snaking across the square itself,\nall waiting for the chance at a photo with the twenty-foot-high landmark.\nOne of seven in this city, all carved from enormous blocks of quartz\nhewn from the Laconian Mountains to the north, the Old Square Gate was\noften called the Heart Gate, thanks to its location in the dead center of\nLunathion, with the other six Gates located equidistant from it, each one\nopening onto a road out of the walled city.\n\u201cThey should make a special access lane for residents to cross the\nsquare,\u201d Bryce muttered as they edged around tourists and hawkers.\n\u201cAnd give tourists fines for slow walking,\u201d Danika muttered back, but\nflashed a lupine grin at a young human couple that recognized her, gawked,\nand began snapping photos.\n\u201cI wonder what they\u2019d think if they knew that nightstalker\u2019s special\nsauce is all over you,\u201d Bryce murmured.\nDanika elbowed her. \u201cAsshole.\u201d She threw a friendly wave to the\ntourists and continued on.\nOn the other side of the Heart Gate, amid a small army of vendors\nselling food and touristy crap, a second line of people waited to access the\ngolden block sticking out of its southern side. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to cut through\nthem to get across,\u201d Bryce said, scowling at the tourists idling in the wilting\nheat.\nBut Danika halted, her angular face turned to the Gate and the plaque.\n\u201cLet\u2019s make a wish.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not waiting in that line.\u201d Usually, they just shouted their wishes\ndrunkenly into the ether late at night when they were staggering home from\nthe White Raven and the square was empty. Bryce checked the time on her\nphone. \u201cDon\u2019t you have to get over to the Comitium?\u201d The Governor\u2019s five-\ntowered stronghold was at least a fifteen-minute walk away.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got time,\u201d Danika said, and grabbed Bryce\u2019s hand, tugging her\nthrough the crowds and toward the real tourist draw of the Gate.\nJutting out of the quartz about four feet off the ground lay the dial pad:\na solid-gold block embedded with seven different gems, each for a different\nquarter of the city, the insignia of each district etched beneath it.\nEmerald and a rose for Five Roses. Opal and a pair of wings for the\nCBD. Ruby and a heart for the Old Square. Sapphire and an oak tree for\nMoonwood. Amethyst and a human hand for Asphodel Meadows. Tiger\u2019s-\neye and a serpent for the Meat Market. And onyx\u2014so black it gobbled the\nlight\u2014and a set of skull and crossbones for the Bone Quarter.\nBeneath the arc of stones and etched emblems, a small, round disk rose\nup slightly, its metal worn down by countless hands and paws and fins and\nany other manner of limb.\nA sign beside it read: Touch at your own risk. Do not use between\nsundown and sunrise. Violators will be fined.\nThe people in line, waiting for access to the disk, seemed to have no\nproblem with the risks.\nA pair of giggling teenage male shifters\u2014some kind of feline from\ntheir scents\u2014goaded each other forward, elbowing and taunting, daring the\nother to touch the disk.\n\u201cPathetic,\u201d Danika said, striding past the line, the ropes, and a bored-\nlooking city guard\u2014a young Fae female\u2014to the very front. She fished a\nbadge from inside her leather coat and flashed it at the guard, who stiffened\nas she realized who\u2019d cut the line. She didn\u2019t even look at the golden\nemblem of the crescent moon bow with an arrow nocked through it before\nstepping back.\n\u201cOfficial Aux business,\u201d Danika declared with an unnervingly straight\nface. \u201cIt\u2019ll just be a minute.\u201d\nBryce stifled her laughter, well aware of the glares fixed on their backs\nfrom the line.\nDanika drawled to the teenage boys, \u201cIf you\u2019re not going to do it, then\nclear off.\u201d\nThey whirled toward her, and went white as death.\nDanika smiled, showing nearly all her teeth. It wasn\u2019t a pleasant sight.\n\u201cHoly shit,\u201d whispered one of them.\nBryce hid her smile as well. It never got old\u2014the awe. Mostly because\nshe knew Danika had earned it. Every damned day, Danika earned the awe\nthat bloomed across the faces of strangers when they spotted her corn-silk\nhair and that neck tattoo. And the fear that made the lowlifes in this city\nthink twice before fucking with her and the Pack of Devils.\nExcept for Philip Briggs. Bryce sent a prayer to Ogenas\u2019s blue depths\nthat the sea goddess would whisper her wisdom to Briggs to keep his\ndistance from Danika if he ever really did walk free.\nThe boys stepped aside, and it only took a few milliseconds for them\nto notice Bryce, too. The awe on their faces turned to blatant interest.\nBryce snorted. Keep dreaming.\nOne of them stammered, turning his attention from Bryce to Danika,\n\u201cMy\u2014my history teacher said the Gates were originally communication\ndevices.\u201d\n\u201cI bet you get all the ladies with those stellar factoids,\u201d Danika said\nwithout looking back at them, unimpressed and uninterested.\nMessage received, they slunk back to the line. Bryce smirked and\nstepped up to her friend\u2019s side, peering down at the dial pad.\nThe teenager was right, though. The seven Gates of this city, each set\nalong a ley line running through Lunathion, had been designed as a quick\nway for the guards in the districts to speak to each other centuries ago.\nWhen someone merely placed a hand against the golden disk in the center\nof the pad and spoke, the wielder\u2019s voice would travel to the other Gates, a\ngem lighting up with the district from which the voice originated.\nOf course, it required a drop of magic to do so\u2014literally sucked it like\na vampyr from the veins of the person who touched the pad, a tickling zap\nof power, gone forever.\nBryce raised her eyes to the bronze plaque above her head. The quartz\nGates were memorials, though she didn\u2019t know for which conflict or war.\nBut each bore the same plaque: The power shall always belong to those who\ngive their lives to the city.\nConsidering it was a statement that could be construed as being in\nopposition to the Asteri\u2019s rule, Bryce was always surprised that they\nallowed the Gates to continue to stand. But after becoming obsolete with\nthe advent of phones, the Gates had found a second life when kids and\ntourists began using them, having their friends go to the other Gates in the\ncity so they could whisper dirty words or marvel at the sheer novelty of\nsuch an antiquated method of communication. Not surprisingly, come\nweekends, drunk assholes\u2014a category to which Bryce and Danika firmly\nbelonged\u2014became such a pain in the ass with their shouting through the\nGates that the city had instituted hours of operation.\nAnd then dumb superstition grew, claiming the Gate could make\nwishes come true, and that to give over a droplet of your power was to\nmake an offering to the five gods.\nIt was bullshit, Bryce knew\u2014but if it made Danika not dread Briggs\u2019s\nrelease so much, well, it was worth it.\n\u201cWhat are you going to wish for?\u201d Bryce asked when Danika stared\ndown at the disk, the gems dark above it.\nThe emerald for FiRo lit up, a young female voice coming through to\nshriek, \u201cTitties!\u201d\nPeople laughed around them, the sound like water trickling over stone,\nand Bryce chuckled.\nBut Danika\u2019s face had gone solemn. \u201cI\u2019ve got too many things to wish\nfor,\u201d she said. Before Bryce could ask, Danika shrugged. \u201cBut I think I\u2019ll\nwish for Ithan to win his sunball game tonight.\u201d\nWith that, she set her palm onto the disk. Bryce watched as her friend\nlet out a shiver and quietly laughed, stepping back. Her caramel eyes shone.\n\u201cYour turn.\u201d\n\u201cYou know I have barely any magic worth taking, but okay,\u201d Bryce\nsaid, not to be outdone, even by an Alpha wolf. From the moment Bryce\nwalked into her dorm room freshman year, they\u2019d done everything together.\nJust the two of them, as it always would be.\nThey even planned to make the Drop together\u2014to freeze into\nimmortality at the same breath, with members of the Pack of Devils\nAnchoring them.\nTechnically, it wasn\u2019t true immortality\u2014the Vanir did age and die,\neither of natural causes or other methods, but the aging process was so\nslowed after the Drop that, depending on one\u2019s species, it could take\ncenturies to show a wrinkle. The Fae could last a thousand years, the\nshifters and witches usually five centuries, the angels somewhere between.\nFull humans did not make the Drop, as they bore no magic. And compared\nto humans, with their ordinary life spans and slow healing, the Vanir were\nessentially immortal\u2014some species bore children who didn\u2019t even enter\nmaturity until they were in their eighties. And most were very, very hard to\nkill.\nBut Bryce had rarely thought about where she\u2019d fall on that spectrum\n\u2014whether her half-Fae heritage would grant her a hundred years or a\nthousand. It didn\u2019t matter, so long as Danika was there for all of it. Starting\nwith the Drop. They\u2019d take the deadly plunge into their matured power\ntogether, encounter whatever lay at the bottom of their souls, and then race\nback up to life before the lack of oxygen rendered them brain-dead. Or just\nplain dead.\nYet while Bryce would inherit barely enough power to do cool party\ntricks, Danika was expected to claim a sea of power that would put her\nranking far past Sabine\u2019s\u2014likely equal to that of Fae royalty, maybe even\nbeyond the Autumn King himself.\nIt was unheard of, for a shifter to have that sort of power, yet all the\nstandard childhood tests had confirmed it: once Danika Dropped, she\u2019d\nbecome a considerable power among the wolves, the likes of which had not\nbeen seen since the elder days across the sea.\nDanika wouldn\u2019t just become the Prime of the Crescent City wolves.\nNo, she had the potential to be the Alpha of all wolves. On the fucking\nplanet.\nDanika never seemed to give two shits about it. Didn\u2019t plan for her\nfuture based on it.\nTwenty-seven was the ideal age to make the Drop, they\u2019d decided\ntogether, after years of mercilessly judging the various immortals who\nmarked their lives by centuries and millennia. Right before any permanent\nlines or wrinkles or gray hairs. They merely said to anyone who inquired,\nWhat\u2019s the point of being immortal badasses if we have sagging tits?\nVain assholes, Fury had hissed when they\u2019d explained it the first time.\nFury, who had made the Drop at age twenty-one, hadn\u2019t chosen the age\nfor herself. It\u2019d just happened, or had been forced upon her\u2014they didn\u2019t\nknow for sure. Fury\u2019s attendance at CCU had only been a front for a\nmission; most of her time was spent doing truly fucked-up things for\ndisgusting amounts of money over in Pangera. She made it a point never to\ngive details.\nAssassin, Danika claimed. Even sweet Juniper, the faun who occupied\nthe fourth side of their little friendship-square, admitted the odds were that\nFury was a merc. Whether Fury was occasionally employed by the Asteri\nand their puppet Imperial Senate was up for debate, too. But none of them\nreally cared\u2014not when Fury always had their back when they needed it.\nAnd even when they didn\u2019t.\nBryce\u2019s hand hovered over the golden disk. Danika\u2019s gaze was a cool\nweight on her.\n\u201cCome on, B, don\u2019t be a wimp.\u201d\nBryce sighed, and set her hand on the pad. \u201cI wish Danika would get a\nmanicure. Her nails look like shit.\u201d\nLightning zapped through her, a slight vacuuming around her belly\nbutton, and then Danika was laughing, shoving her. \u201cYou fucking dick.\u201d\nBryce slung an arm around Danika\u2019s shoulders. \u201cYou deserved it.\u201d\nDanika thanked the security guard, who beamed at the attention, and\nignored the tourists still snapping photos. They didn\u2019t speak until they\nreached the northern edge of the square\u2014where Danika would head toward\nthe angel-filled skies and towers of the CBD, to the sprawling Comitium\ncomplex in its heart, and Bryce toward Luna\u2019s Temple, three blocks up.\nDanika jerked her chin toward the streets behind Bryce. \u201cI\u2019ll see you at\nhome, all right?\u201d\n\u201cBe careful.\u201d Bryce blew out a breath, trying to shake her unease.\n\u201cI know how to look out for myself, B,\u201d Danika said, but love shone in\nher eyes\u2014gratitude that crushed Bryce\u2019s chest\u2014merely for the fact that\nsomeone cared whether she lived or died.\nSabine was a piece of shit. Had never whispered or hinted who\nDanika\u2019s father might be\u2014so Danika had grown up with absolutely no one\nexcept her grandfather, who was too old and withdrawn to spare Danika\nfrom her mother\u2019s cruelty.\nBryce inclined her head toward the CBD. \u201cGood luck. Don\u2019t piss off\ntoo many people.\u201d\n\u201cYou know I will,\u201d Danika said with a grin that didn\u2019t meet her eyes."}, "3": {"Name": "PART I THE HOLLOW-Chapter 3", "Page Content": " \nThe Pack of Devils was already at her apartment by the time Bryce got\nhome from work.\nIt had been impossible to miss the roaring laughter that met her before\nshe\u2019d even cleared the second-floor stairwell landing\u2014as well as the canine\nyips of amusement. Both had continued as she ascended the remaining level\nof the walk-up apartment building, during which time Bryce grumbled to\nherself about her plans for a quiet evening on the couch being ruined.\nChanting a string of curses that would make her mother proud, Bryce\nunlocked the blue-painted iron door to the apartment, bracing for the\nonslaught of lupine bossiness, arrogance, and general nosiness in all matters\nof her life. And that was just Danika.\nDanika\u2019s pack made each of those things an art form. Mostly because\nthey claimed Bryce as one of their own, even if she didn\u2019t bear the tattoo of\ntheir sigil down the side of her neck.\nSometimes she felt bad for Danika\u2019s future mate, whoever that would\nbe. The poor bastard wouldn\u2019t know what hit him when he bound himself to\nher. Unless he was wolf-kind himself\u2014though Danika had about as much\ninterest in sleeping with a wolf as Bryce did.\nThat is to say, not a gods-damned shred.\nGiving the door a good shove with her shoulder\u2014its warped edges got\nstuck more often than not, mostly thanks to the romping of the hellions\ncurrently spread across the several sagging couches and armchairs\u2014Bryce\nsighed as she found six pairs of eyes fixed on her. And six grins.\n\u201cHow was the game?\u201d she asked no one in particular, chucking her\nkeys into the lopsided ceramic bowl Danika had half-assed during a fluff\npottery course in college. She\u2019d heard nothing from Danika regarding the\nBriggs meeting beyond a general I\u2019ll tell you at home.\nIt couldn\u2019t have been that bad, if Danika made it to the sunball game.\nShe\u2019d even sent Bryce a photo of the whole pack in front of the field, with\nIthan a small, helmeted figure in the background.\nA message from the star player himself had popped up later: Next time,\nyou better be with them, Quinlan.\nShe\u2019d written back, Did baby pup miss me?\nYou know it, Ithan had answered.\n\u201cWe won,\u201d Connor drawled from where he lounged on her favorite\nspot on the couch, his gray CCU sunball T-shirt rumpled enough to reveal\nthe cut of muscle and golden skin.\n\u201cIthan scored the winning goal,\u201d Bronson said, still wearing a blue-\nand-silver jersey with Holstrom on the back.\nConnor\u2019s little brother, Ithan, held an unofficial membership in the\nPack of Devils. Ithan also happened to be Bryce\u2019s second-favorite person\nafter Danika. Their message chain was an endless stream of snark and\nteasing, swapped photos, and good-natured grousing about Connor\u2019s\nbossiness.\n\u201cAgain?\u201d Bryce asked, kicking off her four-inch, pearl-white heels.\n\u201cCan\u2019t Ithan share some of the glory with the other boys?\u201d Normally, Ithan\nwould have been sitting right on that couch beside his brother, forcing\nBryce to wedge herself between them while they watched whatever TV\nshow was on, but on game nights, he usually opted to party with his\nteammates.\nA half smile tugged at a corner of Connor\u2019s mouth as Bryce held his\nstare for longer than most people considered wise. His five packmates, two\nstill in wolf form with bushy tails swishing, wisely kept their mouths and\nmaws shut.\nIt was common knowledge that Connor would have been Alpha of the\nPack of Devils if Danika weren\u2019t around. But Connor didn\u2019t resent it. His\nambitions didn\u2019t run that way. Unlike Sabine\u2019s.\nBryce nudged her backup dance bag over on the coatrack to make\nroom for her purse, and asked the wolves, \u201cWhat are you watching\ntonight?\u201d Whatever it was, she\u2019d already decided to curl up with a romance\nnovel in her room. With the door shut.\nNathalie, flipping through celebrity gossip magazines on the couch,\ndidn\u2019t lift her head as she answered, \u201cSome new legal procedural about a\npack of lions taking on an evil Fae corporation.\u201d\n\u201cSounds like a real award winner,\u201d Bryce said. Bronson grunted his\ndisapproval. The massive male\u2019s tastes skewed more toward art house flicks\nand documentaries. Unsurprisingly, he was never allowed to select the\nentertainment for Pack Night.\nConnor ran a calloused finger down the rolled arm of the couch.\n\u201cYou\u2019re home late.\u201d\n\u201cI have a job,\u201d Bryce said. \u201cYou might want to get one. Stop being a\nleech on my couch.\u201d\nThis wasn\u2019t exactly fair. As Danika\u2019s Second, Connor acted as her\nenforcer. To keep this city safe, he\u2019d killed, tortured, maimed, and then\ngone back out and done it again before the moon had even set.\nHe never complained about it. None of them did.\nWhat\u2019s the point in bitching, Danika had said when Bryce asked how\nshe endured the brutality, when there\u2019s no choice in joining the Auxiliary?\nThe predator-born shifters were destined for certain Aux packs before they\nwere even born.\nBryce tried not to glance at the horned wolf tattooed on the side of\nConnor\u2019s neck\u2014proof of that predestined lifetime of service. Of his eternal\nloyalty to Danika, the Pack of Devils, and the Aux.\nConnor just looked Bryce over with that half smile. It set her teeth to\ngrinding. \u201cDanika\u2019s in the kitchen. Eating half the pizza before we can get a\nbite.\u201d\n\u201cI am not!\u201d was the muffled reply.\nConnor\u2019s smile grew.\nBryce\u2019s breathing turned a shade uneven at that smile, the wicked light\nin his eyes.\nThe rest of the pack remained dutifully focused on the television\nscreen, pretending to watch the nightly news.\nSwallowing, Bryce asked him, \u201cAnything I should know?\u201d\nTranslation: Was the Briggs meeting a disaster?\nConnor knew what she meant. He always did. He jerked his head to\nthe kitchen. \u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d\nTranslation: Not great.\nBryce winced, and managed to tear her gaze away from him so she\ncould pad into the galley kitchen. She felt Connor\u2019s stare on her every step\nof the way.\nAnd maybe she swished her hips. Only a tiny bit.\nDanika was indeed shoveling a slice down her throat, her eyes wide in\nwarning for Bryce to keep her mouth shut. Bryce noted the unspoken plea,\nand merely nodded.\nA half-empty bottle of beer dripped condensation onto the white\nplastic counter Danika leaned against, her borrowed silk shirt damp with\nsweat around the collar. Her braid drooped over her slim shoulder, the few\ncolorful streaks unusually muted. Even her pale skin, usually flushed with\ncolor and health, seemed ashen.\nGranted, the crappy kitchen lighting\u2014two meager recessed orbs of\nfirstlight\u2014wasn\u2019t exactly favorable to anyone, but \u2026 Beer. Food. The pack\nkeeping their distance. And that hollow weariness in her friend\u2019s eyes\u2014\nyeah, some shit had gone down in that meeting.\nBryce tugged open the fridge, grabbing a beer for herself. The pack all\nhad different preferences, and were prone to coming over whenever they\nfelt like it, so the fridge was crammed with bottles and cans and what she\ncould have sworn was a jug of \u2026 mead? Must be Bronson\u2019s.\nBryce grabbed one of Nathalie\u2019s favorites\u2014a cloudy, milky-tasting\nbeer, heavy on the hops\u2014and twisted off the top. \u201cBriggs?\u201d\n\u201cOfficially released. Micah, the Autumn King, and the Oracle pored\nover every law and bylaw and still couldn\u2019t find a way around that\nloophole. Ruhn even had Declan run some of his fancy tech searches and\nfound nothing. Sabine ordered the Scythe Moon Pack to watch Briggs\ntonight, along with some of the 33rd.\u201d The packs had mandatory nights off\nonce a week, and this was the Pack of Devils\u2019\u2014no negotiating. Otherwise,\nBryce knew Danika would be out there, watching Briggs\u2019s every move.\n\u201cSo you\u2019re all in agreement,\u201d Bryce said. \u201cAt least that\u2019s good.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, until Briggs blows something or someone up.\u201d Danika shook\nher head with disgust. \u201cIt\u2019s fucking bullshit.\u201d\nBryce studied her friend carefully. The tension around her mouth, her\nsweaty neck. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201cNothing\u2019s wrong.\u201d\nThe words were spoken too quickly to be believable. \u201cSomething\u2019s\nbeen eating at you. Shit like this thing with Briggs is big, but you always\nbounce back.\u201d Bryce narrowed her eyes. \u201cWhat aren\u2019t you telling me?\u201d\nDanika\u2019s eyes gleamed. \u201cNothing.\u201d She swigged from her beer.\nThere was only one other answer. \u201cI take it Sabine was in rare form\nthis afternoon.\u201d\nDanika just tore into her pizza.\nBryce swallowed two mouthfuls of beer, watching Danika blankly\nconsider the teal cabinets above the counter, the paint chipping at the edges.\nHer friend chewed slowly, then said around a mouthful of bread and\ncheese, \u201cSabine cornered me after the meeting. Right in the hall outside\nMicah\u2019s office. So everyone could hear her tell me that two CCU research\nstudents got killed near Luna\u2019s Temple last week during the blackout. My\nshift. My section. My fault.\u201d\nBryce winced. \u201cIt took a week to hear about this?\u201d\n\u201cApparently.\u201d\n\u201cWho killed them?\u201d\nCrescent City University students were always out in the Old Square,\nalways causing trouble. Even as alums Bryce and Danika often bemoaned\nthe fact that there wasn\u2019t a sky-high electric fence penning CCU students\ninto their corner of the city. Just to keep them from puking and pissing all\nover the Old Square every Friday night to Sunday morning.\nDanika drank again. \u201cNo clue who did it.\u201d A shiver, her caramel eyes\ndarkening. \u201cEven with their scents marking them as human, it took twenty\nminutes to identify who they were. They were ripped to shreds and partially\neaten.\u201d\nBryce tried not to imagine it. \u201cMotive?\u201d\nDanika\u2019s throat bobbed. \u201cNo idea, either. But Sabine told me in front\nof everyone exactly what she thought of such a public butchering happening\non my watch.\u201d\nBryce asked, \u201cWhat\u2019d the Prime say about it?\u201d\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Danika said. \u201cThe old man fell asleep during the meeting,\nand Sabine didn\u2019t bother to wake him before cornering me.\u201d It would be\nsoon now, everyone said\u2014only a matter of a year or two until the current\nPrime of the wolves, nearly four hundred years old, had his Sailing across\nthe Istros to the Bone Quarter for his final sleep. There was no way the\nblack boat would tip for him during the final rite\u2014no way his soul would\nbe deemed unworthy and given to the river. He\u2019d be welcomed into the\nUnder-King\u2019s realm, granted access to its mist-veiled shores \u2026 and then\nSabine\u2019s reign would begin.\nGods spare them all.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault, you know,\u201d Bryce said, flipping open the\ncardboard lids of the two closest pizza boxes. Sausage, pepperoni, and\nmeatball in one. The other held cured meats and stinky cheeses\u2014Bronson\u2019s\nchoice, no doubt.\n\u201cI know,\u201d Danika muttered, draining the last of her beer, clunking the\nbottle in the sink, and rooting around in the fridge for another. Every muscle\nin her lean body seemed taut\u2014on a hair trigger. She slammed the fridge\nshut and leaned against it. Danika didn\u2019t meet Bryce\u2019s eyes as she breathed,\n\u201cI was three blocks away that night. Three. And I didn\u2019t hear or see or smell\nthem being shredded.\u201d\nBryce became aware of the silence from the other room. Keen hearing\nin both human and wolf form meant endless, entitled eavesdropping.\nThey could finish this conversation later.\nBryce flipped open the rest of the pizza boxes, surveying the culinary\nlandscape. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you put them out of their misery and let them get a\nbite before you demolish the rest?\u201d\nShe\u2019d had the pleasure of witnessing Danika eat three large pies in one\nsitting. In this sort of mood, Danika might very well break her record and\nhit four.\n\u201cPlease let us eat,\u201d begged Bronson\u2019s deep, rumbling voice from the\nother room.\nDanika swigged from her beer. \u201cCome get it, mongrels.\u201d\nThe wolves rushed in.\nIn the frenzy, Bryce was nearly flattened against the back wall of the\nkitchen, the monthly calendar pinned to it crumpling behind her.\nDamn it\u2014she loved that calendar: Hottest Bachelors of Crescent City:\nClothing-Optional Edition. This month had the most gorgeous daemonaki\nshe\u2019d ever seen, his propped leg on a stool the only thing keeping\neverything from being shown. She smoothed out the new wrinkles in all the\ntan skin and muscles, the curling horns, and then turned to scowl at the\nwolves.\nA step away, Danika stood among her pack like a stone in a river. She\nsmirked at Bryce. \u201cAny update on your hunt for the Horn?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cJesiba must be thrilled.\u201d\nBryce grimaced. \u201cOverjoyed.\u201d She\u2019d seen Jesiba for all of two minutes\nthis afternoon before the sorceress threatened to turn Bryce into a donkey,\nand then vanished in a chauffeured sedan to the gods knew where. Maybe\noff on some errand for the Under-King and the dark House he ruled.\nDanika grinned. \u201cDon\u2019t you have that date with what\u2019s-his-face\ntonight?\u201d\nThe question clanged through Bryce. \u201cShit. Shit. Yes.\u201d She winced at\nthe kitchen clock. \u201cIn an hour.\u201d\nConnor, taking an entire pizza box for himself, stiffened. He\u2019d made\nhis thoughts on Bryce\u2019s rich-ass boyfriend clear since the first date two\nmonths ago. Just as Bryce had made it perfectly clear she did not give a\nfuck about Connor\u2019s opinion regarding her love life.\nBryce took in his muscled back as Connor stalked out, rolling his\nbroad shoulders. Danika frowned. She never missed a fucking thing.\n\u201cI need to get dressed,\u201d Bryce said, scowling. \u201cAnd his name is Reid,\nand you know it.\u201d\nA wolfish smile. \u201cReid\u2019s a stupid fucking name,\u201d Danika said.\n\u201cOne, I think it\u2019s a hot name. And two, Reid is hot.\u201d Gods help her,\nReid Redner was hot as Hel. Though the sex was \u2026 fine. Standard. She\u2019d\ngotten off, but she\u2019d really had to work for it. And not in the way she\nsometimes liked to work for it. More in the sense of Slow down, Put that\nhere, Can we switch positions? But she\u2019d slept with him only twice. And\nshe told herself that it could take time to find the right rhythm with a\npartner. Even if \u2026\nDanika just said it. \u201cIf he grabs his phone to check his messages before\nhis dick\u2019s barely out of you again, please have the self-respect to kick his\nballs across the room and come home to me.\u201d\n\u201cFucking Hel, Danika!\u201d Bryce hissed. \u201cSay it a little gods-damn\nlouder.\u201d\nThe wolves had gone silent. Even their munching had stopped. Then\nresumed just a decibel too loudly.\n\u201cAt least he\u2019s got a good job,\u201d Bryce said to Danika, who crossed her\nslender arms\u2014arms that hid tremendous, ferocious strength\u2014and gave her\na look. A look that said, Yeah, one that Reid\u2019s daddy gave him. Bryce added,\n\u201cAnd at least he\u2019s not some psychotic alphahole who will demand a three-\nday sex marathon and then call me his mate, lock me in his house, and\nnever let me out again.\u201d Which was why Reid\u2014human, okay-at-sex Reid\u2014\nwas perfect.\n\u201cYou could use a three-day sex marathon,\u201d Danika quipped.\n\u201cYou\u2019re to blame for this, you know.\u201d\nDanika waved a hand. \u201cYeah, yeah. My first and last mistake: setting\nyou two up.\u201d\nDanika knew Reid casually through the part-time security work she\ndid for his father\u2019s business\u2014a massive human-owned magi-tech company\nin the Central Business District. Danika claimed that the work was too\nboring to bother explaining, but paid well enough that she couldn\u2019t say no.\nAnd more than that\u2014it was a job she chose. Not the life she\u2019d been shoved\ninto. So between her patrols and obligations with the Aux, Danika was often\nat the towering skyscraper in the CBD\u2014pretending she had a shot at a\nnormal life. It was unheard of for any Aux member to have a secondary job\n\u2014for an Alpha, especially\u2014but Danika made it work.\nIt didn\u2019t hurt that everyone wanted a piece of Redner Industries these\ndays. Even Micah Domitus was a major investor in its cutting-edge\nexperiments. It was nothing out of the ordinary, when the Governor\ninvested in everything from tech to vineyards to schools, but since Micah\nwas on Sabine\u2019s eternal shit list, pissing off her mother by working for a\nhuman company he supported was likely even better for Danika than the\nsense of free will and generous pay.\nDanika and Reid had been in the same presentation one afternoon\nmonths ago\u2014exactly when Bryce had been single and complaining\nconstantly about it. Danika had given Bryce\u2019s number to Reid in a last-ditch\neffort to preserve her sanity.\nBryce smoothed a hand over her dress. \u201cI need to change. Save me a\nslice.\u201d\n\u201cAren\u2019t you going out for dinner?\u201d\nBryce cringed. \u201cYeah. To one of those frilly spots\u2014where they give\nyou salmon mousse on a cracker and call it a meal.\u201d\nDanika shuddered. \u201cDefinitely fill up before, then.\u201d\n\u201cA slice,\u201d Bryce said, pointing at Danika. \u201cRemember my slice.\u201d She\neyed the one remaining box and padded out of the kitchen.\nThe Pack of Devils were now all in human form\u2014save for Zelda\u2014\npizza boxes balanced on knees or spread on the worn blue rug. Bronson was\nindeed swigging from the ceramic jug of mead, his brown eyes fixed on the\nnightly news broadcast. The news about Briggs\u2019s release\u2014along with\ngrainy footage of the human male being escorted out of the jail complex in\na white jumpsuit\u2014began blasting. Whoever held the remote quickly\nchanged the channel to a documentary on the Black River delta.\nNathalie gave Bryce a shit-eating grin as she strode for her bedroom\ndoor at the opposite end of the living room. Oh, Bryce wouldn\u2019t live down\nthat little tidbit about Reid\u2019s performance in the bedroom anytime soon.\nEspecially when Nathalie was sure to make it a reflection on Bryce\u2019s skills.\n\u201cDon\u2019t even start,\u201d Bryce warned her. Nathalie clamped her lips\ntogether, like she could hardly keep the howl of wicked amusement\ncontained. Her sleek black hair seemed to quiver with the effort of holding\nin her laughter, her onyx eyes near-glowing.\nBryce pointedly ignored Connor\u2019s heavy golden stare as he tracked her\nacross the space.\nWolves. Gods-damned wolves shoving their noses into her business.\nThere would never be any mistaking them for humans, though their\nforms were nearly identical. Too tall, too muscled, too still. Even the way\nthey tore into their pizzas, each movement deliberate and graceful, was a\nsilent reminder of what they could do to anyone who crossed them.\nBryce walked over Zach\u2019s sprawled, long legs, and carefully avoided\nstepping on Zelda\u2019s snow-white tail, where she lay on the floor beside her\nbrother. The twin white wolves, both slender and dark-haired in human\nform, were utterly terrifying when they shifted. The Ghosts\u2014the whispered\nnickname followed them everywhere.\nSo, yeah. Bryce tried really hard not to step on Zelda\u2019s fluffy tail.\nThorne, at least, threw Bryce a sympathetic smile from where he sat in\nthe half-rotted leather armchair near the television, his CCU sunball hat\nturned backward. He was the only other person in the apartment who\nunderstood how meddlesome the pack could be. And who cared as much\nabout Danika\u2019s moods. About Sabine\u2019s ruthlessness.\nIt was a long shot for an Omega like Thorne to ever be noticed by an\nAlpha like Danika. Not that Thorne had ever so much as hinted at it to any\nof them. But Bryce saw it\u2014the gravitational pull that seemed to happen\nwhenever Danika and Thorne were in a room together, like they were two\nstars orbiting each other.\nMercifully, Bryce reached her bedroom without any comments\nregarding her sort-of boyfriend\u2019s prowess, and shut the door behind her\nfirmly enough to tell them all to fuck off.\nShe made it three steps toward her sagging green dresser before\nlaughter barked through the apartment. It was silenced a moment later by a\nvicious, not-quite-human snarl. Deep and rumbling and utterly lethal.\nNot Danika\u2019s snarl, which was like death incarnate, soft and husky and\ncold. This was Connor\u2019s. Full of heat and temper and feeling.\nBryce showered off the dust and grime that seemed to coat her\nwhenever she made the fifteen-block walk between the apartment and the\nslim sandstone building that Griffin Antiquities occupied.\nA few carefully placed pins erased the end-of-day limpness that\nusually plagued her heavy sheet of wine-red hair, and she hastily applied a\nfresh coat of mascara to bring some life back into her amber eyes. From\nshower to sliding on her black stiletto heels, it was a grand total of twenty\nminutes.\nProof, she realized, of how little she really cared about this date. She\nspent a gods-damned hour on her hair and makeup every morning. Not\ncounting the thirty-minute shower to get herself gleaming, shaved, and\nmoisturized. But twenty minutes? For dinner at the Pearl and Rose?\nYeah, Danika had a point. And Bryce knew the bitch was watching the\nclock, and would probably ask if the short prep time was reflective of how\nlong, exactly, Reid could keep it going.\nBryce glared in the direction of the wolves beyond the door of her\ncozy bedroom before surveying the quiet haven around her. Every wall was\nbedecked in posters of legendary performances at the Crescent City Ballet.\nOnce, she\u2019d imagined herself up there among the lithe Vanir, exploding\nacross the stage in turn after turn, or making audiences weep with an\nagonizing death scene. Once, she\u2019d imagined there might be a spot for a\nhalf-human female on that stage.\nEven being told, over and over, that she had the wrong body type\nhadn\u2019t stopped her from loving to dance. Hadn\u2019t stopped that heady rush\nseeing a dance performed live, or her taking amateur classes after work, or\nher following CCB\u2019s dancers the way Connor, Ithan, and Thorne followed\nsports teams. Nothing could ever stop her from craving that soaring\nsensation she found when she was dancing, whether in class or at a club or\neven on the gods-damned street.\nJuniper, at least, hadn\u2019t been deterred. Had decided that she was in it\nfor the long haul, that a faun would defy the odds and grace a stage built for\nFae and nymphs and sylphs\u2014and leave them all in her dust. She\u2019d done it,\ntoo.\nBryce loosed a long sigh. Time to go. It was a twenty-minute walk to\nthe Pearl and Rose, and in these heels, it\u2019d take her twenty-five. No point in\ngetting a taxi during the chaos and congestion of Thursday night in the Old\nSquare when the car would just sit there.\nShe stabbed pearl studs into her ears, hoping half-heartedly that they\u2019d\nadd some class to what might be considered a somewhat scandalous dress.\nBut she was twenty-three, and she might as well enjoy her generously\ncurved figure. She gave her gold-dusted legs a little smile as she twisted in\nfront of the full-length mirror propped against the wall to admire the slope\nof her ass in the skintight gray dress, the hint of text from that still-sore new\ntattoo peeking over the plunging back, before she stepped into the living\nroom again.\nDanika let out a wicked laugh that rumbled over the nature show the\nwolves were watching. \u201cI bet fifty silver marks the bouncers don\u2019t let you\nthrough the doors looking like that.\u201d\nBryce flipped off her friend as the pack chuckled. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I make\nyou feel self-conscious about your bony ass, Danika.\u201d\nThorne barked a laugh. \u201cAt least Danika makes up for it with her\nwinning personality.\u201d\nBryce smirked at the handsome Omega. \u201cThat must explain why I\nhave a date and she hasn\u2019t been on one in \u2026 what\u2019s it now? Three years?\u201d\nThorne winked, his blue eyes sliding toward Danika\u2019s scowling face.\n\u201cMust be why.\u201d\nDanika slouched in her chair and propped her bare feet on the coffee\ntable. Each toenail was painted a different color. \u201cIt\u2019s only been two years,\u201d\nshe muttered. \u201cAssholes.\u201d\nBryce patted Danika\u2019s silken head as she passed. Danika nipped at her\nfingers, teeth flashing.\nBryce chuckled, entering the narrow kitchen. She pawed through the\nupper cabinets, glass rattling as she searched for the\u2014\nAh. The gin.\nShe knocked back a shot. Then another.\n\u201cRough night ahead?\u201d Connor asked from where he leaned against the\nkitchen doorway, arms crossed over his muscular chest.\nA drop of gin had landed on her chin. Bryce narrowly avoided wiping\nthe sin-red lipstick off her mouth with the back of her wrist and instead\nopted for patting it away with a leftover napkin from the pizza place. Like a\nproper person.\nThat color should be called Blow Job Red, Danika had said the first\ntime Bryce had worn it. Because that\u2019s all any male will think about when\nyou wear it. Indeed, Connor\u2019s eyes had dipped right to her lips. So Bryce\nsaid as nonchalantly as she could, \u201cYou know I like to enjoy my Thursday\nnights. Why not kick it off early?\u201d\nShe balanced on her toes as she put the gin back in the upper cupboard,\nthe hem of her dress rising precariously high. Connor studied the ceiling as\nif it were immensely interesting, his gaze only snapping to hers as she\nsettled on her feet again. In the other room, someone turned the volume on\nthe television up to an apartment-rattling level.\nThank you, Danika.\nEven wolf hearing couldn\u2019t sort through that cacophony to eavesdrop.\nConnor\u2019s sensuous mouth twitched upward, but he remained in the\ndoorway.\nBryce swallowed, wondering how gross it would be to chase away the\nburn of the gin with the beer she\u2019d left warming on the counter.\nConnor said, \u201cLook. We\u2019ve known each other a while \u2026\u201d\n\u201cIs this a rehearsed speech?\u201d\nHe straightened, color staining his cheeks. The Second in the Pack of\nDevils, the most feared and lethal of all the Auxiliary units, was blushing.\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cThat sounded like a rehearsed introduction to me.\u201d\n\u201cCan you let me ask you out, or do I need to get into a fight with you\nabout my phrasing first?\u201d\nShe snorted, but her guts twisted. \u201cI don\u2019t date wolves.\u201d\nConnor threw her a cocky grin. \u201cMake an exception.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d But she smiled slightly.\nConnor merely said with the unwavering arrogance that only an\nimmortal predator could achieve, \u201cYou want me. I want you. It\u2019s been that\nway for a while, and playing with these human males hasn\u2019t done a damn\nthing to make you forget that, has it?\u201d\nNo, it hadn\u2019t. But she said, her voice mercifully calm despite her\nthundering heart, \u201cConnor, I\u2019m not going out with you. Danika is bossy\nenough. I don\u2019t need another wolf, especially a male wolf, trying to run my\nlife. I don\u2019t need any more Vanir shoving into my business.\u201d\nHis golden eyes dimmed. \u201cI\u2019m not your father.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t mean Randall.\nShe shoved off the counter, marching toward him. And the apartment\ndoor beyond. She was going to be late. \u201cThat has nothing to do with this\u2014\nwith you. My answer is no.\u201d\nConnor didn\u2019t move, and she halted mere inches away. Even in heels,\neven though she fell on the taller side of average height, he towered over\nher. Dominated the entire space just by breathing.\nLike any alphahole would. Like what her Fae father had done to\nnineteen-year-old Ember Quinlan, when he\u2019d pursued her, seduced her,\ntried to keep her, and gone so far into possessive territory that the moment\nEmber had realized she was carrying his child\u2014carrying Bryce\u2014she ran\nbefore he could scent it and lock her up in his villa in FiRo until she grew\ntoo old to interest him.\nWhich was something Bryce didn\u2019t let herself consider. Not after the\nblood tests had been done and she\u2019d walked out of the medwitch\u2019s office\nknowing that she\u2019d taken after her Fae father in more ways than the red hair\nand pointed ears.\nShe would have to bury her mother one day, bury Randall, too. Which\nwas utterly expected, if you were a human. But the fact that she\u2019d go on\nliving for a few more centuries, with only photos and videos to remind her\nof their voices and faces, made her stomach twist.\nShe should have had a third shot of gin.\nConnor remained unmoving in the doorway. \u201cOne date won\u2019t send me\ninto a territorial hissy fit. It doesn\u2019t even have to be a date. Just \u2026 pizza,\u201d\nhe finished, glancing at the stacked boxes.\n\u201cYou and I go out plenty.\u201d They did\u2014on nights when Danika was\ncalled in to meet with Sabine or the other Aux commanders, he often\nbrought over food, or he met up with her at one of the many restaurants\nlining the apartment\u2019s lively block. \u201cIf it\u2019s not a date, then how is it\ndifferent?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019d be a trial run. For a date,\u201d Connor said through his teeth.\nShe lifted a brow. \u201cA date to decide if I want to date you?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re impossible.\u201d He pushed off the doorjamb. \u201cSee you later.\u201d\nSmiling to herself, she trailed him out of the kitchen, cringing at the\nmonstrously loud television the wolves were all watching very, very\nintently.\nEven Danika knew there were limits to how far she could push Connor\nwithout serious consequences.\nFor a heartbeat, Bryce debated grabbing the Second by the shoulder\nand explaining that he\u2019d be better off finding a nice, sweet wolf who wanted\nto have a litter of pups, and that he didn\u2019t really want someone who was ten\nkinds of fucked-up, still liked to party until she was no better than a puking-\nin-an-alley CCU student, and wasn\u2019t entirely sure if she could love\nsomeone, not when Danika was all she really needed anyway.\nBut she didn\u2019t grab Connor, and by the time Bryce scooped her keys\nfrom the bowl beside the door, he\u2019d slumped onto the couch\u2014again, in her\nspot\u2014and was staring pointedly at the screen. \u201cBye,\u201d she said to no one in\nparticular.\nDanika met her gaze from across the room, her eyes still wary but\nfaintly amused. She winked. \u201cLight it up, bitch.\u201d\n\u201cLight it up, asshole,\u201d Bryce replied, the farewell sliding off her\ntongue with the ease of years of usage.\nBut it was Danika\u2019s added \u201cLove you\u201d as Bryce slipped out into the\ngrimy hallway that made her hesitate with her hand on the knob.\nIt\u2019d taken Danika a few years to say those words, and she still used\nthem sparingly. Danika had initially hated it when Bryce said them to her\u2014\neven when Bryce explained that she\u2019d spent most of her life saying it, just\nin case it was the last time. In case she wouldn\u2019t get to say goodbye to the\npeople who mattered most. And it had taken one of their more fucked-up\nadventures\u2014a trashed motorcycle, and literally having guns pointed at their\nheads\u2014to get Danika to utter the words, but at least she now said them.\nSometimes.\nForget Briggs\u2019s release. Sabine must have really done a number on\nDanika.\nBryce\u2019s heels clacked on the worn tile floor as she headed for the stairs\nat the end of the hall. Maybe she should cancel on Reid. She could grab\nsome buckets of ice cream from the corner market and cuddle in bed with\nDanika while they watched their favorite absurd comedies.\nMaybe she\u2019d call up Fury and see if she could pay a little visit to\nSabine.\nBut\u2014she\u2019d never ask that of Fury. Fury kept her professional shit out\nof their lives, and they knew better than to ask too many questions. Only\nJuniper could get away with it.\nHonestly, it made no sense that any of them were friends: the future\nAlpha of all wolves, an assassin for high-paying clients waging war across\nthe sea, a stunningly talented dancer and the only faun ever to grace the\nstage of the Crescent City Ballet, and \u2026 her.\nBryce Quinlan. Assistant to a sorceress. Would-be, wrong-body-type\ndancer. Chronic dater of preening, breakable human men who had no idea\nwhat to do with her. Let alone what to do with Danika, if they ever got far\nenough into the dating crucible.\nBryce clomped down the stairs, scowling at one of the orbs of firstlight\nthat cast the crumbling gray-blue paint in flickering relief. The landlord\nwent as cheap as possible on the firstlight, likely siphoning it off the grid\nrather than paying the city for it like everyone else.\nEverything in this apartment building was a piece of shit, to be honest.\nDanika could afford better. Bryce certainly couldn\u2019t. And Danika knew\nher well enough not to even suggest that she alone pay for one of the high-\nrise, glossy apartments by the river\u2019s edge or in the CBD. So after\ngraduation, they\u2019d only looked at places Bryce could swing with her\npaycheck\u2014this particular shithole being the least miserable of them.\nSometimes, Bryce wished she\u2019d accepted her monstrous father\u2019s\nmoney\u2014wished she hadn\u2019t decided to develop some semblance of morals\nat the exact moment the creep had offered her mountains of gold marks in\nexchange for her eternal silence about him. At least then she\u2019d currently be\nlounging by some sky-high pool deck, ogling oiled-up angels as they\nswaggered past, and not avoiding the letch of a janitor who leered at her\nchest anytime she had to complain about the trash chute being blocked yet\nagain.\nThe glass door at the bottom of the stairwell led onto the night-\ndarkened street, already packed with tourists, revelers, and bleary-eyed\nresidents trying to squeeze their way home through the rowdy crowds after\na long, hot summer day. A draki male clad in a suit and tie rushed past,\nmessenger bag bobbing at his hip as he wove his way around a family of\nsome sort of equine shifters\u2014perhaps horses, judging by their scents full of\nopen skies and green fields\u2014all so busy snapping photos of everything that\nthey remained oblivious to anyone trying to get somewhere.\nAt the corner, a pair of bored malakim clad in the black armor of the\n33rd kept their wings tucked in tight to their powerful bodies, no doubt to\navoid any harried commuter or drunk idiot touching them. Touch an angel\u2019s\nwings without permission and you\u2019d be lucky to lose just a hand.\nFirmly shutting the glass door behind her, Bryce soaked in the tangle\nof sensations that was this ancient, vibrant city: the dry summer heat that\nthreatened to bake her very bones; the honk of car horns slicing through the\nsteady hiss and dribble of music leaking from the revel halls; the wind off\nthe Istros River, three blocks away, rustling the swaying palms and\ncypresses; the hint of brine from the nearby turquoise sea; the seductive,\nnight-soft smell of the crawling jasmine wrapped around the iron park fence\nnearby; the tang of puke and piss and stale beer; the beckoning, smoky\nspices crusting the slow-roasting lamb at the vendor\u2019s cart on the corner \u2026\nIt all hit her in one awakening kiss.\nTrying not to snap her ankles on the cobblestones, Bryce breathed in\nthe nightly offering of Crescent City, drank it deep, and vanished down the\nteeming street."}, "4": {"Name": "PART I THE HOLLOW-Chapter 4", "Page Content": " \nThe Pearl and Rose was everything Bryce hated about this city.\nBut at least Danika now owed her fifty silver marks.\nThe bouncers had let her stride past them, up the three steps, and\nthrough the open bronze-plated doors of the restaurant.\nBut even fifty silver marks wouldn\u2019t put so much as a dent in paying\nfor this meal. No, this would be firmly in the gold zone.\nReid could certainly afford it. Given the size of his bank account, he\nlikely wouldn\u2019t even glance at the check before handing over his black card.\nSeated at a table in the heart of the gilded dining room, under the\ncrystal chandeliers dangling from the intricately painted ceiling, Bryce went\nthrough two glasses of water and half a bottle of wine while she waited.\nTwenty minutes in, her phone buzzed in her black silk clutch. If Reid\nwas canceling on her, she\u2019d kill him. There was no fucking way she could\nafford to pay for the wine\u2014not without having to give up dance classes for\nthe next month. Two months, actually.\nBut the messages weren\u2019t from Reid, and Bryce read them three times\nbefore chucking her phone back in her purse and pouring another glass of\nvery, very expensive wine.\nReid was rich and he was late. He owed her.\nEspecially since the upper echelons of Crescent City were entertaining\nthemselves by sneering at her dress, the skin on display, the Fae ears but\nclearly human body.\nHalf-breed\u2014she could nearly hear the hateful term as they thought it.\nThey considered her a lowly worker at best. Prey and dumpster fodder at\nworst.\nBryce took out her phone and read the messages a fourth time.\nConnor had written, You know I\u2019m shit with talking. But what I wanted\nto say\u2014before you tried to get into a fight with me instead, by the way\u2014was\nthat I think it\u2019s worth it. You and me. Giving us a shot.\nHe\u2019d added: I\u2019m crazy about you. I don\u2019t want anyone else. I haven\u2019t\nfor a long while. One date. If it doesn\u2019t work, then we\u2019ll deal with it. But\njust give me a chance. Please.\nBryce was still staring at the messages, her head spinning from all that\ngods-damned wine, when Reid finally appeared. Forty-five minutes late.\n\u201cSorry, babe,\u201d he said, leaning in to kiss her cheek before sliding onto\nhis chair. His charcoal-gray suit remained immaculate, his golden skin\nglowing above the collar of his white shirt. Not one dark brown hair on his\nhead was out of place.\nReid had the easy manners of someone brought up with money,\neducation, and no doors locked to his desires. The Redners were one of the\nfew human families who had risen into Vanir high society\u2014and dressed for\nthe part. Reid was meticulous about his appearance, down to the very last\ndetail. Every tie he wore, she\u2019d learned, was selected to bring out the green\nin his hazel eyes. His suits were always impeccably cut to his toned body.\nShe might have called him vain, had she not put such consideration into her\nown outfits. Had she not known that Reid worked with a personal trainer\nfor the exact reason that she kept dancing\u2014beyond her love for it\u2014making\nsure her body was primed for when its strength might be needed to escape\nany would-be predator hunting the streets.\nSince the day the Vanir had crawled through the Northern Rift and\novertaken Midgard eons ago, an event historians called the Crossing,\nrunning was the best option if a Vanir decided to make a meal of you. That\nis, if you didn\u2019t have a gun or bombs or any of the horrid things people like\nPhilip Briggs had developed to kill even a long-lived, quick-healing\ncreature.\nShe often wondered about it: what it had been like before this planet\nhad found itself occupied by creatures from so many different worlds, all of\nthem far more advanced and civilized than this one, when it was just\nhumans and ordinary animals. Even their calendar system hearkened to the\nCrossing, and the time before and after it: H.E. and V.E.\u2014Human Era and\nVanir Era.\nReid lifted his dark brows at the mostly empty bottle of wine. \u201cNice\nchoice.\u201d\nForty-five minutes. Without a call or a message to tell her he\u2019d be late.\nBryce gritted her teeth. \u201cSomething came up at work?\u201d\nReid shrugged, scanning the restaurant for high-ranking officials to\nhobnob with. As the son of a man who had his name displayed in twenty-\nfoot letters on three buildings in the CBD, people usually lined up to chat\nwith him. \u201cSome of the malakim are restless about developments in the\nPangeran conflict. They needed reassurance their investments were still\nsound. The call ran long.\u201d\nThe Pangeran conflict\u2014the fighting Briggs so badly wanted to bring\nto this territory. The wine that had gone to her head eddied into an oily pool\nin her gut. \u201cThe angels think the war might spread here?\u201d\nSpying no one of interest in the restaurant, Reid flipped open his\nleather-bound menu. \u201cNo. The Asteri wouldn\u2019t let that happen.\u201d\n\u201cThe Asteri let it happen over there.\u201d\nHis lips twitched downward. \u201cIt\u2019s a complicated issue, Bryce.\u201d\nConversation over. She let him go back to studying the menu.\nReports of the territory across the Haldren Sea were grim: the human\nresistance was prepared to wipe themselves out rather than submit to the\nAsteri and their \u201celected\u201d Senate\u2019s rule. For forty years now, the war had\nraged in the vast Pangeran territory, wrecking cities, creeping toward the\nstormy sea. Should the conflict cross it, Crescent City, sitting on Valbara\u2019s\nsoutheastern coast\u2014midway up a peninsula called the Hand for the shape\nof the arid, mountainous land that jutted out\u2014would be one of the first\nplaces in its path.\nFury refused to talk about what she saw over there. What she did over\nthere. What side she fought for. Most Vanir did not find a challenge to more\nthan fifteen thousand years of their reign amusing.\nMost humans did not find fifteen thousand years of near-slavery, of\nbeing prey and food and whores, to be all that amusing, either. Never mind\nthat in recent centuries, the Imperial Senate had granted humans more rights\n\u2014with the Asteri\u2019s approval, of course. The fact remained that anyone who\nstepped out of line was thrown right back to where they\u2019d started: literal\nslaves to the Republic.\nThe slaves, at least, existed mostly in Pangera. A few lived in Crescent\nCity, namely among the warrior-angels in the 33rd, the Governor\u2019s personal\nlegion, marked by the SPQM slave tattoo on their wrists. But they blended\nin, for the most part.\nCrescent City, for all that its wealthiest were grade A assholes, was still\na melting pot. One of the rare places where being a human didn\u2019t\nnecessarily mean a lifetime of menial labor. Though it didn\u2019t entitle you to\nmuch else.\nA dark-haired, blue-eyed Fae female caught Bryce\u2019s cursory glance\naround the room, her boy toy across the table marking her as some sort of\nnoble.\nBryce had never decided whom she hated more: the winged malakim\nor the Fae. The Fae, probably, whose considerable magic and grace made\nthem think they were allowed to do what they pleased, with anyone they\npleased. A trait shared by many members of the House of Sky and Breath:\nthe swaggering angels, the lofty sylphs, and the simmering elementals.\nHouse of Shitheads and Bastards, Danika always called them. Though\nher own allegiance to the House of Earth and Blood might have shaded her\nopinion a bit\u2014especially when the shifters and Fae were forever at odds.\nBorn of two Houses, Bryce had been forced to yield her allegiance to\nthe House of Earth and Blood as part of accepting the civitas rank her father\nhad gotten her. It had been the price paid for accepting the coveted citizen\nstatus: he\u2019d petition for full citizenship, but she would have to claim Sky\nand Breath as her House. She\u2019d resented it, resented the bastard for making\nher choose, but even her mother had seen that the benefits outweighed the\ncosts.\nNot that there were many advantages or protections for humans within\nthe House of Earth and Blood, either. Certainly not for the young man\nseated with the Fae female.\nBeautiful, blond, no more than twenty, he was likely a tenth of his Fae\ncompanion\u2019s age. The tanned skin of his wrists held no hint of the four-\nlettered slave tattoo. So he had to be with her through his own free will,\nthen\u2014or desire for whatever she offered: sex, money, influence. It was a\nfool\u2019s bargain, though. She\u2019d use him until she was bored, or he grew too\nold, and then dump his ass at the curb, still craving those Fae riches.\nBryce inclined her head to the noblewoman, who bared her too-white\nteeth at the insolence. The Fae female was beautiful\u2014but most of the Fae\nwere.\nShe found Reid watching, a frown on his handsome face. He shook his\nhead\u2014at her\u2014and resumed reading the menu.\nBryce sipped her wine. Signaled the waiter to bring over another\nbottle.\nI\u2019m crazy about you.\nConnor wouldn\u2019t tolerate the sneering, the whispering. Neither would\nDanika. Bryce had witnessed both of them rip into the stupid assholes\nwho\u2019d hissed slurs at her, or who mistook her for one of the many half-\nVanir females who scraped a living in the Meat Market by selling their\nbodies.\nMost of those women didn\u2019t get the chance to complete the Drop\u2014\neither because they didn\u2019t make it to the threshold of maturity or because\nthey got the short end of the stick with a mortal life span. There were\npredators, both born and trained, who used the Meat Market as a personal\nhunting ground.\nBryce\u2019s phone buzzed, right as the waiter finally made his way over,\nfresh bottle of wine in hand. Reid frowned again, his disapproval heavy\nenough that she refrained from reading the message until she\u2019d ordered her\nbeef-with-cheese-foam sandwich.\nDanika had written, Dump the limp-dicked bastard and put Connor out\nof his misery. A date with him won\u2019t kill you. He\u2019s been waiting years,\nBryce. Years. Give me something to smile about tonight.\nBryce cringed as she shoved her phone back into her bag. She looked\nup to find Reid on his own phone, thumbs flying, his chiseled features\nilluminated by the dim screen. Their invention five decades ago had\noccurred right in Redner Industries\u2019 famed tech lab, and vaulted the\ncompany into unprecedented fortune. A new era of linking the world,\neveryone claimed. Bryce thought they just gave people an excuse not to\nmake eye contact. Or be bad dates.\n\u201cReid,\u201d she said. He just held up a finger.\nBryce tapped a red nail on the base of her wineglass. She kept her nails\nlong\u2014and took a daily elixir to keep them strong. Not as effective as talons\nor claws, but they could do some damage. At least enough to potentially get\naway from an assailant.\n\u201cReid,\u201d she said again. He kept typing, and looked up only when the\nfirst course appeared.\nIt was indeed a salmon mousse. Over a crisp of bread, and encaged in\nsome latticework of curling green plants. Small ferns, perhaps. She\nswallowed her laugh.\n\u201cGo ahead and dig in,\u201d Reid said distantly, typing again. \u201cDon\u2019t wait\nfor me.\u201d\n\u201cOne bite and I\u2019ll be done,\u201d she muttered, lifting her fork but\nwondering how the Hel to eat the thing. No one around them used their\nfingers, but \u2026 The Fae female sneered again.\nBryce set down the fork. Folded her napkin into a neat square before\nshe rose. \u201cI\u2019m going.\u201d\n\u201cAll right,\u201d Reid said, eyes fixed on his screen. He clearly thought she\nwas going to the bathroom. She could feel the eyes of a well-dressed angel\nat the next table travel up her expanse of bare leg, then heard the chair\ngroan as he leaned back to admire the view of her ass.\nExactly why she kept her nails strong.\nBut she said to Reid, \u201cNo\u2014I\u2019m leaving. Thank you for dinner.\u201d\nThat made him look up. \u201cWhat? Bryce, sit down. Eat.\u201d\nAs if his being late, being on the phone, weren\u2019t part of this. As if she\nwere just something he needed to feed before he fucked. She said clearly,\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t working out.\u201d\nHis mouth tightened. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d\nShe doubted he\u2019d ever been dumped. She said with a sweet smile,\n\u201cBye, Reid. Good luck with work.\u201d\n\u201cBryce.\u201d\nBut she had enough gods-damned self-respect not to let him explain,\nnot to accept sex that was merely okay basically in exchange for meals at\nrestaurants she could never afford, and a man who had indeed rolled off her\nand gotten right back on that phone. So she swiped the bottle of wine and\nstepped away from the table, but not toward the exit.\nShe went up to the sneering Fae female and her human plaything and\nsaid in a cool voice that would have made even Danika back away, \u201cLike\nwhat you see?\u201d\nThe female gave her a sweeping glance, from Bryce\u2019s heels to her red\nhair to the bottle of wine dangling from her fingers. The Fae female\nshrugged, setting the black stones in her long dress sparkling. \u201cI\u2019ll pay a\ngold mark to watch you two.\u201d She inclined her head to the human at her\ntable.\nHe offered Bryce a smile, his vacant face suggesting he was soaring\nhigh on some drug.\nBryce smirked at the female. \u201cI didn\u2019t know Fae females had gotten so\ncheap. Word on the street used to be that you\u2019d pay us gold by the armful to\npretend you\u2019re not lifeless as Reapers between the sheets.\u201d\nThe female\u2019s tan face went white. Glossy, flesh-shredding nails\nsnagged on the tablecloth. The man across from her didn\u2019t so much as\nflinch.\nBryce put a hand on the man\u2019s shoulder\u2014in comfort or to piss off the\nfemale, she wasn\u2019t sure. She squeezed lightly, again inclining her head\ntoward the female, and strode out.\nShe swigged from the bottle of wine and flipped off the preening\nhostess on her way through the bronze doors. Then snatched a handful of\nmatchbooks from the bowl atop the stand, too.\nReid\u2019s breathless apologies to the noble drifted behind her as Bryce\nstepped onto the hot, dry street.\nWell, shit. It was nine o\u2019clock, she was decently dressed, and if she\nwent back to that apartment, she\u2019d pace around until Danika bit her head\noff. And the wolves would shove their noses into her business, which she\ndidn\u2019t want to discuss with them at all.\nWhich left one option. Her favorite option, fortunately.\nFury picked up on the first ring. \u201cWhat.\u201d\n\u201cAre you on this side of the Haldren or the wrong one?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m in Five Roses.\u201d The flat, cool voice was laced with a hint of\namusement\u2014practically outright laughter, coming from Fury. \u201cBut I\u2019m not\nwatching television with the pups.\u201d\n\u201cWho the Hel would want to do that?\u201d\nA pause on the line. Bryce leaned against the pale stone exterior of the\nPearl and Rose. \u201cI thought you had a date with what\u2019s-his-face.\u201d\n\u201cYou and Danika are the worst, you know that?\u201d\nShe practically heard Fury\u2019s wicked smile through the line. \u201cI\u2019ll meet\nyou at the Raven in thirty minutes. I need to finish up a job.\u201d\n\u201cGo easy on the poor bastard.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I was paid to do.\u201d\nThe line went dead. Bryce swore and prayed Fury wouldn\u2019t reek of\nblood when she got to their preferred club. She dialed another number.\nJuniper was breathless when she picked up on the fifth ring, right\nbefore it went to audiomail. She must have been in the studio, practicing\nafter-hours. As she always did. As Bryce loved to do whenever she had a\nspare moment herself. To dance and dance and dance, the world fading into\nnothing but music and breath and sweat. \u201cOh, you dumped him, didn\u2019t\nyou?\u201d\n\u201cDid motherfucking Danika send a message to everyone?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d the sweet, lovely faun replied, \u201cbut you\u2019ve been on your date for\nonly an hour. Since the recap calls usually happen the morning after \u2026\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to the Raven,\u201d Bryce snapped. \u201cBe there in thirty.\u201d She\nhung up before Juniper\u2019s quicksilver laugh set her cursing.\nOh, she\u2019d find a way to punish Danika for telling them. Even though\nshe knew it\u2019d been meant as a warning, to prepare them for any picking up\nthe pieces, if necessary. Just as Bryce had checked in with Connor\nregarding Danika\u2019s state earlier that evening.\nThe White Raven was only a five-minute walk away, right in the heart\nof the Old Square. Which left Bryce with enough time to either really, truly\nget into trouble, or face what she\u2019d been avoiding for an hour now.\nShe opted for trouble.\nLots of trouble, enough to empty out the seven hard-earned gold marks\nin her purse as she handed them over to a grinning draki female, who\nslipped everything Bryce asked for into her waiting palm. The female had\ntried to sell her on some new party drug\u2014Synth will make you feel like a\ngod, she said\u2014but the thirty gold marks for a single dose had been well\nabove Bryce\u2019s pay grade.\nShe was still left with five minutes. Standing across from the White\nRaven, the club still teeming with revelers despite Briggs\u2019s failed plan to\nblast it apart, Bryce pulled out her phone and opened the thread with\nConnor. She\u2019d bet all the money she\u2019d just blown on mirthroot that he was\nchecking his phone every two seconds.\nCars crawled past, the bass of their sound systems thumping over the\ncobblestones and cypresses, windows down to reveal passengers eager to\nstart their Thursday: drinking; smoking; singing along to the music;\nmessaging friends, dealers, whoever might get them into one of the dozen\nclubs that lined Archer Street. Queues already snaked from the doors,\nincluding the Raven\u2019s. Vanir peered up in anticipation at the white marble\nfacade, well-dressed pilgrims waiting at the gates of a temple.\nThe Raven was just that: a temple. Or it had been. A building now\nencased the ruins, but the dance floor remained the original, ancient stones\nof some long-forgotten god\u2019s temple, and the carved stone pillars\nthroughout still stood from that time. To dance inside was to worship that\nnameless god, hinted at in the age-worn carvings of satyrs and fauns\ndrinking and dancing and fucking amid grapevines. A temple to pleasure\u2014\nthat\u2019s what it had once been. And what it had become again.\nA cluster of young mountain-lion shifters prowled past, a few twisting\nback to growl in invitation. Bryce ignored them and sidled over to an alcove\nat the left of the Raven\u2019s service doors. She leaned against the slick stone,\ntucked the wine into the crook of her arm, braced a foot on the wall behind\nher as she bobbed her head to the music pouring out of a nearby car, and\nfinally typed: Pizza. Saturday night at six. If you\u2019re late, it\u2019s over.\nInstantly, Connor began typing in reply. Then the bubble paused. Then\nstarted again.\nThen finally, the message came.\nI\u2019ll never keep you waiting.\nShe rolled her eyes and wrote, Don\u2019t make promises you can\u2019t keep.\nMore typing, deleting, typing. Then, You mean it\u2014about the pizza?\nDo I look like I\u2019m joking, Connor?\nYou looked delicious when you left the apartment.\nHeat curled in her, and she bit her lip. Charming, arrogant bastard. Tell\nDanika I\u2019m going to the Raven with Juniper and Fury. I\u2019ll see you in two\ndays.\nDone. What about what\u2019s-his-face?\nREID is officially dumped.\nGood. I was getting worried I\u2019d have to kill him.\nHer gut churned.\nHe quickly added, Kidding, Bryce. I won\u2019t go alphahole on you, I\npromise.\nBefore she could answer, her phone buzzed again.\nDanika, this time. HOW DARE YOU GO TO THE RAVEN WITHOUT\nME. TRAITOR.\nBryce snorted. Enjoy Pack Night, loser.\nDO NOT HAVE FUN WITHOUT ME. I FORBID YOU.\nShe knew that as much as it killed Danika to stay in, she wouldn\u2019t\nleave the pack. Not on the one night they all had together, the night they\nused to keep the bonds between them strong. Not after this shitstorm of a\nday. And especially not while Briggs was on the loose, with a reason to get\nback at the whole Pack of Devils.\nThat loyalty was why they loved Danika, why they fought so fiercely\nfor her, went to the mat for her again and again when Sabine publicly\nwondered if her daughter was worthy of the responsibilities and status as\nsecond in line. The power hierarchy among the wolves of Crescent City was\ndictated by dominance alone\u2014but the three-generation lineage that made\nup the Prime of the wolves, Prime Apparent, and whatever Danika was (the\nApparent Prime Apparent?) was a rarity. Powerful, ancient bloodlines was\nthe usual explanation.\nDanika had spent countless hours looking into the history of the\ndominant shifter packs in other cities\u2014why lions had come to rule in\nHilene, why tigers oversaw Korinth, why falcons reigned in Oia. Whether\nthe dominance that determined the Prime Alpha status passed through\nfamilies or skipped around. Non-predatory shifters could head up a city\u2019s\nAux, but it was rare. Honestly, most of it bored Bryce to tears. And if\nDanika had ever learned why the Fendyr family claimed such a large share\nof the dominance pie, she\u2019d never told Bryce.\nBryce wrote back to Connor, Good luck handling Danika.\nHe simply replied, She\u2019s telling me the same about you.\nBryce was about to put her phone away when the screen flashed again.\nConnor had added, You won\u2019t regret this. I\u2019ve had a long while to figure out\nall the ways I\u2019m going to spoil you. All the fun we\u2019re going to have.\nStalker. But she smiled.\nGo enjoy yourself. I\u2019ll see you in a few days. Message me when you\u2019re\nhome safe.\nShe reread the conversation twice because she really was an absolute\nfucking loser, and was debating asking Connor to skip waiting and just\nmeet her now, when something cool and metal pressed against her throat.\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re dead,\u201d crooned a female voice.\nBryce yelped, trying to calm the heart that had gone from stupid-giddy\nto stupid-scared in the span of one beat.\n\u201cDon\u2019t fucking do that,\u201d she hissed at Fury as the female lowered the\nknife from Bryce\u2019s throat and sheathed it across her back.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be a walking target,\u201d Fury said coolly, her long onyx hair tied\nhigh in a ponytail that brought out the sharp lines of her light brown face.\nShe scanned the line into the Raven, her deep-set chestnut eyes marking\neverything and promising death to anyone who crossed her. But beneath\nthat \u2026 mercifully, the black leather leggings, skintight velvet top, and ass-\nkicking boots did not smell of blood. Fury gave Bryce a once-over. \u201cYou\nbarely put on any makeup. That little human should have taken one look at\nyou and known you were about to dump his ass.\u201d\n\u201cHe was too busy on his phone to notice.\u201d\nFury glanced pointedly at Bryce\u2019s own phone, still clenched in a death\ngrip in her hand. \u201cDanika\u2019s going to nail your balls to the wall when I tell\nher I caught you distracted like that.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s her own damn fault,\u201d Bryce snapped.\nA sharp smile was her only response. Bryce knew Fury was Vanir, but\nshe had no idea what kind. No idea what House Fury belonged to, either.\nAsking wasn\u2019t polite, and Fury, aside from her preternatural speed, grace,\nand reflexes, had never revealed another form, nor any inkling of magic\nbeyond the most basic.\nBut she was a civitas. A full citizen, which meant she had to be\nsomething they deemed worthy. Given her skill set, the House of Flame and\nShadow was the likeliest place for her\u2014even if Fury was certainly not a\ndaemonaki, vampyr, or even a wraith. Definitely not a witch-turned-\nsorceress like Jesiba, either. Or a necromancer, since her gifts seemed to be\ntaking life, not illegally bringing it back.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the leggy one?\u201d Fury asked, taking the wine bottle from\nBryce and swigging as she scanned the teeming clubs and bars along Archer\nStreet.\n\u201cHel if I know,\u201d Bryce said. She winked at Fury and held up the plastic\nbag of mirthroot, jostling the twelve rolled black cigarettes. \u201cI got us some\ngoodies.\u201d\nFury\u2019s grin was a flash of red lips and straight white teeth. She reached\ninto the back pocket of her leggings and held up a small bag of white\npowder that glittered with a fiery iridescence in the glow of the streetlamp.\n\u201cSo did I.\u201d\nBryce squinted at the powder. \u201cIs that what the dealer just tried to sell\nme?\u201d\nFury went still. \u201cWhat\u2019d she say it was?\u201d\n\u201cSome new party drug\u2014gives you a godlike high, I don\u2019t know. Super\nexpensive.\u201d\nFury frowned. \u201cSynth? Stay away from it. That\u2019s some bad shit.\u201d\n\u201cAll right.\u201d She trusted Fury enough to heed the warning. Bryce\npeered at the powder Fury still held in her hand. \u201cI can\u2019t take anything that\nmakes me hallucinate for days, please. I have work tomorrow.\u201d When she\nhad to at least pretend she had some idea how to find that gods-damned\nHorn.\nFury tucked the bag into her black bra. She swigged from the wine\nagain before passing it back to Bryce. \u201cJesiba won\u2019t be able to scent it on\nyou, don\u2019t worry.\u201d\nBryce linked elbows with the slender assassin. \u201cThen let\u2019s go make our\nancestors roll over in their graves.\u201d"}, "5": {"Name": "PART I THE HOLLOW-Chapter 5", "Page Content": " \nGoing on a date with Connor in a few days didn\u2019t mean she had to behave.\nSo within the inner sanctum of the White Raven, Bryce savored every\ndelight it offered.\nFury knew the owner, Riso, either through work or whatever the Hel\nshe did in her personal life, and as such, they never had to wait in line. The\nflamboyant butterfly shifter always left a booth open for them.\nNone of the smiling, colorfully dressed waiters who brought over their\ndrinks so much as blinked at the lines of glittering white powder Fury\narranged with a sweep of her hand or the plumes of smoke that rippled from\nBryce\u2019s parted lips as she tipped her head back to the domed, mirrored\nceiling and laughed.\nJuniper had a studio class at dawn, so she abstained from the powder\nand smoke and booze. But it didn\u2019t stop her from sneaking away for a good\ntwenty minutes with a broad-chested Fae male who took in the dark brown\nskin, the exquisite face and curling black hair, the long legs that ended in\ndelicate hooves, and practically begged on his knees for the faun to touch\nhim.\nBryce reduced herself into the pulsing beat of the music, to the\neuphoria glittering through her blood faster than an angel diving out of the\nsky, to the sweat sliding down her body as she writhed on the ancient dance\nfloor. She would barely be able to walk tomorrow, would have half a brain,\nbut holy shit\u2014more, more, more.\nLaughing, she swooped over the low-lying table in their private booth\nbetween two half-crumbling pillars; laughing, she arched away, a red nail\nreleasing its hold on one nostril as she sagged against the dark leather\nbench; laughing, she knocked back water and elderberry wine and stumbled\nagain into the dancing throng.\nLife was good. Life was fucking good, and she couldn\u2019t gods-damn\nwait to make the Drop with Danika and do this until the earth crumbled into\ndust.\nShe found Juniper dancing amid a pack of sylph females celebrating a\nfriend\u2019s successful Drop. Their silvery heads were adorned with circlets of\nneon glow sticks chock-full of their friend\u2019s designated allotment of her\nown firstlight, which she\u2019d generated when she successfully completed the\nDrop. Juniper had managed to swipe a glow-stick halo for herself, and her\nhair shone with blue light as she extended her hands to Bryce, their fingers\nlinking as they danced.\nBryce\u2019s blood pulsed in time to the music, as if she had been crafted\njust for this: the moment when she became the notes and rhythm and the\nbass, when she became song given form. Juniper\u2019s glittering eyes told\nBryce that she understood, had always understood the particular freedom\nand joy and unleashing that came from dancing. Like their bodies were so\nfull of sound they could barely contain it, could barely stand it, and only\ndance could express it, ease it, honor it.\nMales and females gathered to watch, their lust coating Bryce\u2019s skin\nlike sweat. Juniper\u2019s every movement matched hers without so much as a\nlick of hesitation, as if they were question and answer, sun and moon.\nQuiet, pretty Juniper Andromeda\u2014the exhibitionist. Even dancing in\nthe sacred, ancient heart of the Raven, she was sweet and mild, but she\nshone.\nOr maybe that was all the lightseeker Bryce had ingested up her nose.\nHer hair clung to her sweaty neck, her feet were utterly numb thanks to\nthe steep angle of her heels, her throat was ravaged from screaming along to\nthe songs that blasted through the club.\nShe managed to shoot a few messages to Danika\u2014and one video,\nbecause she could barely read any of what was coming in anyway.\nShe\u2019d be so royally fucked if she showed up at work tomorrow unable\nto read.\nTime slowed and bled. Here, dancing among the pillars and upon the\ntimeworn stones of the temple that had been reborn, no time existed at all.\nMaybe she\u2019d live here.\nQuit her job at the gallery and live in the club. They could hire her to\ndance in one of the steel cages dangling from the glass ceiling high above\nthe temple ruins that made up the dance floor. They certainly wouldn\u2019t spew\nbullshit about a wrong body type. No, they\u2019d pay her to do what she loved,\nwhat made her come alive like nothing else.\nIt seemed like a reasonable enough plan, Bryce thought as she\nstumbled down her own street later with no recollection of leaving the\nRaven, saying goodbye to her friends, or of how the Hel she\u2019d even gotten\nhere. Taxi? She\u2019d blown all her marks on the drugs. Unless someone had\npaid \u2026\nWhatever. She\u2019d think about it tomorrow. If she could even sleep. She\nwanted to stay awake, to dance for-gods-damn-ever. Only \u2026 oh, her feet\nfucking hurt. And they were near-black and sticky\u2014\nBryce paused outside her building door and groaned as she unstrapped\nher heels and gathered them in a hand. A code. Her building had a code to\nget in.\nBryce contemplated the keypad as if it\u2019d open a pair of eyes and tell\nher. Some buildings did that.\nShit. Shiiit. She pulled out her phone, the glaring screen light burning\nher eyes. Squinting, she could make out a few dozen message alerts. They\nblurred, her eyes trying and failing to focus enough to read one single\ncoherent letter. Even if she somehow managed to call Danika, her friend\nwould rip her head off.\nThe screech of the building buzzer would piss off Danika even more.\nBryce cringed, hopping from foot to foot.\nWhat was the code? The code, the code, the cooooode \u2026\nOh, there it was. Tucked into a back pocket of her mind.\nShe cheerfully punched in the numbers, then heard the buzz as the lock\nopened with a faint, tinny sound.\nShe scowled at the reek of the stairwell. That gods-damned janitor.\nShe\u2019d kick his ass. Impale him with these useless, cheap stilettos that had\nwrecked her feet\u2014\nBryce set a bare foot on the stairs and winced. This was going to hurt.\nWalking-on-glass hurt.\nShe let her heels clunk to the tile floor, whispering a fervent promise to\nfind them tomorrow, and gripped the black-painted metal banister with both\nhands. Maybe she could straddle the banister and scoot herself up the stairs.\nGods, it stunk. What did the people in this building eat? Or, for that\nmatter, who did they eat? Hopefully not wasted, stupid-high, half-Fae\nfemales who couldn\u2019t manage to walk up the stairs.\nIf Fury had laced the lightseeker with something else, she\u2019d fucking\nkill her.\nSnorting at the idea of even attempting to kill the infamous Fury Axtar,\nBryce hauled herself up the stairs, step by step.\nShe debated sleeping on the second-level landing, but the stench was\noverwhelming.\nMaybe she\u2019d get lucky and Connor would still be at the apartment.\nAnd then she\u2019d really get lucky.\nGods, she wanted good sex. No-holds-barred, scream-your-lungs-out\nsex. Break-the-bed sex. She knew Connor would be like that. More than\nthat. It\u2019d go far beyond the physical with him. It might honestly melt\nwhatever was left of her mind after tonight.\nIt was why she\u2019d been a coward, why she\u2019d avoided thinking about it\nfrom the moment he\u2019d leaned in her doorway five years ago, having come\nto say hi to Danika and meet her new roommate, and they\u2019d just \u2026 stared at\neach other.\nHaving Connor living four doors down freshman year had been the\nworst sort of temptation. But Danika had given the order to stay away until\nBryce approached him, and even though they hadn\u2019t yet formed the Pack of\nDevils, Connor obeyed. It seemed Danika had lifted the order tonight.\nLovely, wicked Danika. Bryce smiled as she half crawled onto the\nthird-floor landing, found her balance, and dug her keys out of her purse\u2014\nwhich she\u2019d managed to hold on to by some miracle. She took a few\nswaying steps down the hall they shared with one other apartment.\nOh, Danika was going to be so pissed. So pissed that Bryce had not\nonly had fun without her, but that she\u2019d gotten so wasted she couldn\u2019t\nremember how to read. Or the code to the building.\nThe flickering firstlight stung her eyes enough that she again squinted\nthem to near-darkness and staggered down the hall. She should shower, if\nshe could remember how to operate the handles. Wash off her filthy, numb\nfeet.\nEspecially after she stepped in a cold puddle beneath some dripping\nceiling pipe. She shuddered, bracing a hand on the wall, but kept staggering\nahead.\nFuck. Too many drugs. Even her Fae blood couldn\u2019t clear them out fast\nenough.\nBut there was her door. Keys. Right\u2014she had them in her hand\nalready.\nThere were six. Which one was hers? One opened the gallery; one\nopened the various tanks and cages in the archives; one opened Syrinx\u2019s\ncrate; one was to the chain on her scooter; one was to her scooter \u2026 and\none was to the door. This door.\nThe brass keys tinkled and swayed, shining in the firstlights, then\nblending with the painted metal of the hall. They slipped out of her\nslackening fingers, clanking on the tile.\n\u201cFuuuuuuck.\u201d The word was a long exhale.\nBracing a hand on the doorframe to keep from falling clean on her ass,\nBryce stooped to pick up the keys.\nSomething cool and wet met her fingertips.\nBryce closed her eyes, willing the world to stop spinning. When she\nopened them, she focused on the tile before the door.\nRed. And the smell\u2014it wasn\u2019t the reek of before.\nIt was blood.\nAnd the apartment door was already open.\nThe lock had been mangled, the handle wrenched off completely.\nIron\u2014the door was iron, and enchanted with the best spells money\ncould buy to keep out any unwanted guests, attackers, or magic. Those\nspells were the one thing Bryce had ever allowed Danika to purchase on her\nbehalf. She hadn\u2019t wanted to know how much they\u2019d cost, not when it was\nlikely double her parents\u2019 annual salary.\nBut the door now looked like a crumpled piece of paper.\nBlinking furiously, Bryce straightened. Fuck the drugs in her system\u2014\nfuck Fury. She\u2019d promised no hallucinations.\nBryce was never drinking or polluting her body with those drugs ever\nagain. She\u2019d tell Danika first thing tomorrow. No more. No. More.\nShe rubbed her eyes, mascara smearing on her fingertips. On her\nblood-soaked fingertips\u2014\nThe blood remained. The mangled door, too.\n\u201cDanika?\u201d she croaked. If the attacker was still inside \u2026\u201cDanika?\u201d\nThat bloody hand\u2014her own hand\u2014pushed the half-crumpled door\nopen farther.\nBlackness greeted her.\nThe coppery tang of blood, and that festering odor, slammed into her.\nHer entire body seized, every muscle going on alert, every instinct\nscreaming to run, run, run\u2014\nBut her Fae eyes adjusted to the dark, revealing the apartment.\nWhat was left of it.\nWhat was left of them.\nHelp\u2014she needed to get help, but\u2014\nShe staggered into the trashed apartment.\n\u201cDanika?\u201d The word was a raw, broken sound.\nThe wolves had fought. There wasn\u2019t a piece of furniture that was\nintact, that wasn\u2019t shredded and splintered.\nThere wasn\u2019t a body intact, either. Piles and clumps were all that\nremained.\n\u201cDanikaDanikaDanika\u2014\u201d\nShe needed to call someone, needed to scream for help, needed to get\nFury, or her brother, her father, needed Sabine\u2014\nBryce\u2019s bedroom door was destroyed, the threshold painted in blood.\nThe ballet posters hung in ribbons. And on the bed \u2026\nShe knew in her bones it was not a hallucination, what lay on that bed,\nknew in her bones that what bled out inside her chest was her heart.\nDanika lay there. In pieces.\nAnd at the foot of the bed, littering the torn carpet in even smaller\npieces, as if he\u2019d gone down defending Danika \u2026 she knew that was\nConnor.\nKnew the heap just to the right of the bed, closest to Danika \u2026 That\nwas Thorne.\nBryce stared. And stared.\nPerhaps time stopped. Perhaps she was dead. She couldn\u2019t feel her\nbody.\nA clanging, echoing thunk sounded from outside. Not from the\napartment, but the hall.\nShe moved. The apartment warped, shrinking and expanding as if it\nwere breathing, the floors rising with each inhale, but she managed to\nmove.\nThe small kitchen table lay in fragments. Her blood-slick, shaking\nfingers wrapped around one of its wooden legs, silently lifting it over her\nshoulder. She peered into the hall.\nIt took a few blinks to clear her contracting vision. The gods-damned\ndrugs\u2014\nThe trash chute hatch lay open. Blood that smelled of wolf coated the\nrusty metal door, and prints that did not belong to a human stained the tile\nfloor, aiming toward the stairs.\nIt was real. She blinked, over and over, swaying against the door\u2014\nReal. Which meant\u2014\nFrom far away, she saw herself launch into the hallway.\nSaw herself slam into the opposite wall and rebound off it, then\nscramble into a sprint toward the stairwell.\nWhatever had killed them must have heard her coming and hidden\ninside the trash chute, waiting for the chance to leap out at her or slink away\nunnoticed\u2014\nBryce hit the stairs, a glowing white haze creeping over her vision. It\nblazed through every inhibition, disregarded every warning bell.\nThe glass door at the bottom of the stairs was already shattered. People\nscreamed outside.\nBryce leapt from the top of the landing.\nHer knees popped and buckled as she cleared the stairs, her bare feet\nshredding on the glass littering the lobby floor. Then they ripped open more\nas she hurtled through the door and into the street, scanning\u2014\nPeople were gasping to the right. Others were screaming. Cars had\nhalted, drivers and passengers all staring toward a narrow alley between the\nbuilding and its neighbor.\nTheir faces blurred and stretched, twisting their horror into something\ngrotesque, something strange and primordial and\u2014\nThis was no hallucination.\nBryce sprinted across the street, following the screams, the reek\u2014\nHer breath tore apart her lungs as she hurtled along the alley, dodging\npiles of trash. Whatever she was chasing had gotten only a brief head start.\nWhere was it, where was it?\nEvery logical thought was a ribbon floating above her head. She read\nthem, as if following a stock ticker mounted on a building\u2019s side in the\nCBD.\nOne glimpse, even if she couldn\u2019t kill it. One glimpse, just to ID it, for\nDanika\u2014\nBryce cleared the alley, careening onto bustling Central Avenue, the\nstreet full of fleeing people and honking cars. She leapt over their hoods,\nscaling them one after another, every movement as smooth as one of her\ndance steps. Leap, twirl, arch\u2014her body did not fail her. Not as she\nfollowed the creature\u2019s rotting stench to another alley. Another and another.\nThey were almost at the Istros. A snarl and roar rent the air ahead. It\nhad come from another connected alley, more of a dead-end alcove between\ntwo brick buildings.\nShe hefted the table leg, wishing she\u2019d grabbed Danika\u2019s sword\ninstead, wondering if Danika had even had time to unsheathe it\u2014\nNo. The sword was in the gallery, where Danika had ignored Jesiba\u2019s\nwarning and left it in the supply closet. Bryce launched herself around the\nalley\u2019s corner.\nBlood everywhere. Everywhere.\nAnd the thing halfway down the alley \u2026 not Vanir. Not one she\u2019d\nencountered before.\nA demon? Some feral thing with smooth, near-translucent gray skin. It\ncrawled on four long, spindly limbs, but looked vaguely humanoid. And it\nwas feasting on someone else.\nOn\u2014on a malakh.\nBlood covered the angel\u2019s face, soaking his hair and veiling the\nswollen, battered features beneath. His white wings were splayed and\nsnapped, his powerful body arced in agony as the beast ripped at his chest\nwith a maw of clear, crystalline fangs that easily dug through skin and bone\n\u2014\nShe did not think, did not feel.\nShe moved, fast like Randall had taught her, brutal like he\u2019d made her\nlearn to be.\nShe slammed the table leg into the creature\u2019s head so hard that bone\nand wood cracked.\nIt was thrown off the angel and whirled, its back legs twisting beneath\nit while its front legs\u2014arms\u2014gouged lines in the cobblestones.\nThe creature had no eyes. Only smooth planes of bone above deep slits\n\u2014its nose.\nAnd the blood that leaked from its temple \u2026 it was clear, not red.\nBryce panted, the malakh male groaning some wordless plea as the\ncreature sniffed at her.\nShe blinked and blinked, willing the lightseeker and mirthroot out of\nher system, willing the image ahead to stop blurring\u2014\nThe creature lunged. Not for her\u2014but the angel. Right back to the\nchest and heart it was trying to get to. The more considerable prey.\nBryce launched forward, table leg swinging again. The reverberations\nagainst bone bit into her palm. The creature roared, blindly surging at her.\nShe dodged, but its sharp, clear fangs ripped her thigh clean open as\nshe twisted away.\nShe screamed, losing her balance, and swung upward as it leapt again,\nthis time for her throat.\nWood smashed those clear teeth. The demon shrieked, so loudly that\nher Fae ears nearly ruptured, and she dared all of one blink\u2014\nClaws scraped, hissing sounded, and then it was gone.\nIt was just clearing the lip of the brick building the malakh lay\nslumped against. She could track it from the streets, could keep it in sight\nlong enough for the Aux or 33rd to come\u2014\nBryce had dared one step when the angel groaned again. His hand was\nagainst his chest, pushing weakly. Not hard enough to stop the death-bite\nfrom gushing blood. Even with his fast healing, even if he\u2019d made the Drop,\nthe injuries were substantial enough to be fatal.\nSomeone screamed in a nearby street as the creature jumped between\nbuildings.\nGo, go, go.\nThe angel\u2019s face was so battered it was barely more than a slab of\nswollen flesh.\nThe table leg clattered into a puddle of the angel\u2019s blood as she dove\nfor him, biting down her scream at the burning gash in her thigh. Someone\nhad poured acid onto her skin, her bones.\nUnbearable, impenetrable darkness swept through her, blanketing\neverything within.\nBut she shoved her hand against the angel\u2019s wound, not allowing\nherself to feel the wet, torn flesh, the jagged bone of his cleaved sternum.\nThe creature had been eating its way into his heart\u2014\n\u201cPhone,\u201d she panted. \u201cDo you have a phone?\u201d\nThe angel\u2019s white wing was so shredded it was mostly red splinters.\nBut it shifted slightly to reveal the pocket of his black jeans. The square\nlump in them.\nHow she managed to pull out the phone with one hand was beyond\nher. Time was still snagging, speeding and stopping. Pain lanced through\nher leg with every breath.\nBut she gripped the sleek black device in her wrecked hands, her red\nnails almost snapping with the force as she punched in the emergency\nnumber.\nA male voice answered on the first ring. \u201cCrescent City Rescue\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHelp.\u201d Her voice broke. \u201cHelp.\u201d\nA pause. \u201cMiss, I need you to specify where you are, what the situation\nis.\u201d\n\u201cOld Square.

Didn\u2019t know the cross\nstreets. \u201cPlease\u2014please help.\u201d\nThe angel\u2019s blood soaked her lap. Her knees were bleeding, scraped\nraw.\nAnd Danika was\nAnd Danika was\nAnd Danika was\n\u201cMiss, I need you to tell me where you are\u2014we can have wolves on\nthe scene in a minute.\u201d\nShe sobbed then, and the angel\u2019s limp fingers brushed against her torn\nknee.

She looked like death.\nLooked like the soldiers he\u2019d seen crawl off the blood-drenched\nbattlefields of Pangera.\nShe sat at the metal table in the center of the interrogation room,\nstaring at nothing. Just as she had done for hours now.\nA far cry from the screaming, thrashing female Isaiah and his unit had\nfound in the Old Square alley, her gray dress ripped, her left thigh gushing\nenough blood that he wondered if she\u2019d faint. She\u2019d been half-wild, either\nfrom the sheer terror of what had occurred, the grief sinking in, or the drugs\nthat had been coursing through her system.\nLikely a combination of all three. And considering that she was not\nonly a source of information regarding the attack, but also currently a\ndanger to herself, Isaiah had made the call to bring her into the sterile,\nsubterranean processing center a few blocks from the Comitium. A witness,\nhe\u2019d made damn sure the records stated. Not a suspect.\nHe blew out a long breath, resisting the urge to rest his forehead\nagainst the observation window. Only the incessant hum of the firstlights\noverhead filled the space.\nThe first bit of quiet he\u2019d had in hours. He had little doubt it would end\nsoon.\nAs if the thought had tempted Urd herself, a rough male voice spoke\nfrom the door behind him. \u201cShe\u2019s still not talking?\u201d\nIt took all two centuries of Isaiah\u2019s training on and off the battlefield to\navoid flinching at that voice. To turn slowly toward the angel he knew\nwould be leaning against the doorway, wearing his usual black battle-suit\u2014\nan angel who reason and history reminded him was an ally, though every\ninstinct roared the opposite.\nPredator. Killer. Monster.\nHunt Athalar\u2019s angular dark eyes, however, remained fixed on the\nwindow. On Bryce Quinlan. Not one gray feather on his wings rustled. Ever\nsince their first days in the 17th Legion in southern Pangera, Isaiah had\ntried to ignore the fact that Hunt seemed to exist within a permanent ripple\nof stillness. It was the bated silence before a thunderclap, like the entire\nland held its breath when he was near.\nGiven what he\u2019d seen Hunt do to his enemies and chosen targets, it\ncame as no surprise.\nHunt\u2019s stare slid toward him.\nRight. He\u2019d been asked a question. Isaiah shifted his white wings.\n\u201cShe hasn\u2019t said a word since she was brought in.\u201d\nHunt again regarded the female through the window. \u201cHas the order\ncome down yet to move her to another room?\u201d\nIsaiah knew exactly what sort of room Hunt referred to. Rooms\ndesigned to get people to talk. Even witnesses.\nIsaiah straightened his black silk tie and offered up a half-hearted plea\nto the five gods that his charcoal business suit wouldn\u2019t be stained with\nblood by sunrise. \u201cNot yet.\u201d\nHunt nodded once, his golden-brown face betraying nothing.\nIsaiah scanned the angel, since Hunt sure as Hel wasn\u2019t going to\nvolunteer anything without being prompted. No sign of the skull-faced\nhelmet that had earned Hunt a nickname whispered down every corridor\nand street in Crescent City: the Umbra Mortis.\nThe Shadow of Death.\nUnable to decide whether to be relieved or worried at the absence of\nHunt\u2019s infamous helmet, Isaiah wordlessly handed Micah\u2019s personal\nassassin a thin file.\nHe made sure his dark brown fingers didn\u2019t touch Hunt\u2019s gloved ones.\nNot when blood still coated the leather, its scent creeping through the room.\nHe recognized the angelic scent in that blood, so the other scent had to be\nBryce Quinlan\u2019s.\nIsaiah jerked his chin to the white-tiled interrogation room. \u201cBryce\nQuinlan, twenty-three years old, half-Fae, half-human. Blood test from ten\nyears ago confirmed she\u2019ll have an immortal life span. Power rating near-\nnegligible. Hasn\u2019t made the Drop yet. Listed as a full civitas. Found in the\nalley with one of our own, trying to keep his heart from falling out with her\nbare hands.\u201d\nThe words sounded so damn clinical. But he knew Hunt was well\nversed in the details. They both were. They\u2019d been in that alley, after all.\nAnd they knew that even here, in the secure observation room, they\u2019d be\nfools to risk saying anything delicate aloud.\nIt had taken both of them to get Bryce to her feet, only for her to\ncollapse against Isaiah\u2014not from grief but from pain.\nHunt had realized it first: her thigh had been shredded open.\nShe\u2019d still been nearly feral, had thrashed as they guided her back to\nthe ground, Isaiah calling for a medwitch as the blood gushed out of her\nthigh. An artery had been hit. It was a gods-damn miracle she wasn\u2019t dead\nbefore they arrived.\nHunt had cursed up a storm as he knelt before her, and she\u2019d bucked,\nnearly kicking him in the balls. But then he\u2019d pulled off his helmet. Looked\nher right in the eye.\nAnd told her to calm the fuck down.\nShe\u2019d fallen completely silent. Just stared at Hunt, blank and hollow.\nShe didn\u2019t so much as flinch with each punch of the staple gun Hunt had\npulled from the small medkit built into his battle-suit. She just stared and\nstared and stared at the Umbra Mortis.\nYet Hunt hadn\u2019t lingered after he\u2019d stapled her leg shut\u2014he\u2019d\nlaunched into the night to do what he did best: find their enemies and\nobliterate them.\nAs if noticing the blood on his gloves, Hunt swore and peeled them\noff, dumping them into the metal trash can by the door.\nThen the male leafed through Quinlan\u2019s thin file, his shoulder-length\nblack hair slipping over his unreadable face.\n\u201cSeems like she\u2019s your standard spoiled party girl,\u201d he said, turning the\npages. A corner of Hunt\u2019s mouth curved upward, anything but amused.\n\u201cAnd what a surprise: she\u2019s Danika Fendyr\u2019s roommate. The Party Princess\nherself.\u201d\nNo one but the 33rd used that term\u2014because no one else in Lunathion,\nnot even the Fae royals, would have dared. But Isaiah motioned to keep\nreading. Hunt had left the alley before he\u2019d learned the entire scope of this\ndisaster.\nHunt kept reading. His brows rose. \u201cHoly fucking Urd.\u201d\nIsaiah waited for it.\nHunt\u2019s dark eyes widened. \u201cDanika Fendyr is dead?\u201d He read further.\n\u201cAlong with the entire Pack of Devils.\u201d He shook his head and repeated,\n\u201cHoly fucking Urd.\u201d\nIsaiah took back the file. \u201cIt is totally and completely fucked, my\nfriend.\u201d\nHunt\u2019s jaw clenched. \u201cI didn\u2019t find any trace of the demon that did\nthis.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d At Hunt\u2019s questioning glance, Isaiah clarified, \u201cIf you had,\nyou\u2019d be holding a severed head in your hands right now and not a file.\u201d\nIsaiah had been there\u2014on many occasions\u2014when Hunt had done just\nthat, returning triumphant from a demon-hunting mission he\u2019d been ordered\nto go on by whatever Archangel currently held their reins.\nHunt\u2019s mouth twitched slightly, as if remembering the last time he\u2019d\npresented a kill in such a manner, but he crossed his powerful arms. Isaiah\nignored the inherent dominance in the position. There was a pecking order\namong them, the five-warrior team who made up the triarii\u2014the most elite\nof all the Imperial Legion units. Micah\u2019s little cabal.\nThough Micah had appointed Isaiah the Commander of the 33rd, he\u2019d\nnever formally declared him its leader. But Isaiah had always assumed he\nstood right at the top, the unspoken finest soldier of the triarii, despite his\nfancy suit and tie.\nWhere Hunt fell, however \u2026 no one had really decided in the two\nyears since he\u2019d arrived from Pangera. Isaiah wasn\u2019t entirely sure he really\nwanted to know, either.\nTracking down and eliminating any demons who crept through cracks\nin the Northern Rift or entered this world through an illegal summoning\nwas his official role, and one well suited to Hunt\u2019s particular skill set. The\ngods knew how many of them he\u2019d tracked down over the centuries,\nstarting from that very first Pangeran unit they\u2019d been in together\u2014the 17th\n\u2014dedicated to sending the creatures into the afterlife.\nBut the work Hunt did in the shadows for the Archangels\u2014for Micah,\ncurrently\u2014that was what had earned him his nickname. Hunt answered\ndirectly to Micah, and the rest of them stayed out of his way.\n\u201cNaomi just arrested Philip Briggs for the murders,\u201d Isaiah said,\nnaming the captain of the 33rd\u2019s infantry. \u201cBriggs got out of jail today\u2014and\nDanika and the Pack of Devils were the ones who busted him in the first\nplace.\u201d That the honor hadn\u2019t gone to the 33rd had irked Isaiah to no end.\nAt least Naomi had been the one to apprehend him tonight. \u201cHow the fuck a\nhuman like Briggs could summon a demon that powerful, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose we\u2019ll find out soon enough,\u201d Hunt said darkly.\nYeah, they fucking would. \u201cBriggs has to be ten kinds of stupid to have\nbeen released only to go for a kill that big.\u201d The leader of the Keres rebels\n\u2014an offshoot of the larger rebellion movement, the Ophion\u2014hadn\u2019t\nseemed dumb, though. Just a fanatic hell-bent on starting a conflict to\nmirror the war raging across the sea.\n\u201cOr maybe Briggs acted on the sole chance of freedom he had before\nwe found an excuse to bring him back into custody,\u201d Hunt countered. \u201cHe\nknew his time was limited and wanted to make sure he got one up on the\nVanir first.\u201d\nIsaiah shook his head. \u201cWhat a mess.\u201d Understatement of the century.\nHunt blew out a breath. \u201cHas the press gotten wind of anything?\u201d\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d Isaiah said. \u201cAnd I got the order a few minutes ago that\nwe\u2019re to keep it quiet\u2014even if it\u2019ll be all over the news tomorrow\nmorning.\u201d\nHunt\u2019s eyes gleamed. \u201cI\u2019ve got no one to tell.\u201d\nIndeed, Hunt and the concept of friends didn\u2019t mesh well. Even among\nthe triarii, even after being here for two years, Hunt still kept to himself.\nStill worked relentlessly toward one thing: freedom. Or rather, the slim\nchance of it.\nIsaiah sighed. \u201cHow soon until Sabine gets here?\u201d\nHunt checked his phone. \u201cSabine\u2019s on her way downstairs right\u2014\u201d\nThe door blew open. Hunt\u2019s eyes flickered. \u201cNow.\u201d\nSabine looked barely older than Bryce Quinlan, with her fine-boned\nface and long, silvery blond hair, but there was only an immortal\u2019s rage in\nher blue eyes. \u201cWhere is that half-breed whore\u2014\u201d She simmered as she\nspotted Bryce through the window. \u201cI\u2019ll fucking kill her\u2014\u201d\nIsaiah extended a white wing to block the Prime Apparent\u2019s path back\nout the door and into the interrogation room, a few steps to its left.\nHunt fell into a casual stance on her other side. Lightning danced along\nhis knuckles.\nA mild showing of the power Isaiah had witnessed being unleashed\nupon their enemies: lightning, capable of bringing down a building.\nWhether ordinary angel or Archangel, the power was always some\nvariation of the same: rain, storms, the occasional tornado\u2014Isaiah himself\ncould summon wind capable of keeping a charging enemy at bay, but none\nin living memory possessed Hunt\u2019s ability to harness lightning to his will.\nOr the depth of power to make it truly destructive. It had been Hunt\u2019s\nsalvation and destruction.\nIsaiah let one of his cold breezes sift through Sabine\u2019s corn-silk hair,\nover to Hunt.\nThey\u2019d always worked well together\u2014Micah had known it when he\nput Hunt with Isaiah two years ago, despite the entwined thorns tattooed\nacross both their brows. Most of Hunt\u2019s mark was hidden by his dark hair,\nbut there was no concealing the thin black band on his forehead.\nIsaiah could barely remember what his friend had looked like before\nthose Pangeran witches had branded him, working their infernal spells into\nthe ink itself so they might never let his crimes be forgotten, so the witch-\nmagic bound the majority of his power.\nThe halo, they called it\u2014a mockery of the divine auras early humans\nhad once portrayed angels as possessing.\nThere was no hiding it on Isaiah\u2019s brow, either, the tattoo on it the\nsame as on Hunt\u2019s, and on the brows of the nearly two thousand rebel\nangels who had been such idealistic, brave fools two centuries ago.\nThe Asteri had created the angels to be their perfect soldiers and loyal\nservants. The angels, gifted with such power, had relished their role in the\nworld. Until Shahar, the Archangel they\u2019d once called the Daystar. Until\nHunt and the others who\u2019d flown in Shahar\u2019s elite 18th Legion.\nTheir rebellion had failed\u2014only for the humans to begin their own\nforty years ago. A different cause, a different group and species of fighters,\nbut the sentiment was essentially the same: the Republic was the enemy, the\nrigid hierarchies utter bullshit.\nWhen the human rebels had started their war, one of the idiots should\nhave asked the Fallen angels how their rebellion had failed, long before\nthose humans were even born. Isaiah certainly could have given them some\npointers on what not to do. And enlightened them about the consequences.\nFor there was also no hiding the second tattoo, stamped on their right\nwrists: SPQM.\nIt adorned every flag and letterhead of the Republic\u2014the four letters\nencircled with seven stars\u2014and adorned the wrist of every being owned by\nit. Even if Isaiah chopped off his arm, the limb that regrew would bear the\nmark. Such was the power of the witch-ink.\nA fate worse than death: to become an eternal servant to those they\u2019d\nsought to overthrow.\nDeciding to spare Sabine from Hunt\u2019s way of dealing with things,\nIsaiah asked mildly, \u201cI understand you are grieving, but do you have reason,\nSabine, to want Bryce dead?\u201d\nSabine snarled, pointing at Bryce, \u201cShe took the sword. That wannabe\nwolf took Danika\u2019s sword. I know she did, it\u2019s not at the apartment\u2014and\nit\u2019s mine.\u201d\nIsaiah had seen those details: that the heirloom of the Fendyr family\nwas missing. But there was no sign of Bryce Quinlan possessing it. \u201cWhat\ndoes the sword have to do with your daughter\u2019s death?\u201d\nRage and grief warred in that feral face. Sabine shook her head,\nignoring his question, and said, \u201cDanika couldn\u2019t stay out of trouble. She\ncould never keep her mouth shut and know when to be quiet around her\nenemies. And look what became of her. That stupid little bitch in there is\nstill breathing, and Danika is not.\u201d Her voice nearly cracked. \u201cDanika\nshould have known better.\u201d\nHunt asked a shade more gently, \u201cKnown better about what?\u201d\n\u201cAll of it,\u201d Sabine snapped, and again shook her head, clearing her\ngrief away. \u201cStarting with that slut of a roommate.\u201d She whirled on Isaiah,\nthe portrait of wrath. \u201cTell me everything.\u201d\nHunt said coolly, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have to tell you shit, Fendyr.\u201d\nAs Commander of the 33rd Imperial Legion, Isaiah held an equal rank\nto Sabine: they both sat on the same governing councils, both answered to\nmales of power within their own ranks and their own Houses.\nSabine\u2019s canines lengthened as she surveyed Hunt. \u201cDid I fucking\nspeak to you, Athalar?\u201d\nHunt\u2019s eyes glittered. But Isaiah pulled out his phone, typing as he cut\nin calmly, \u201cWe\u2019re still getting the reports in. Viktoria is coming to talk to\nMiss Quinlan right now.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll talk to her,\u201d Sabine seethed. Her fingers curled, as if ready to rip\nout Hunt\u2019s throat. Hunt gave her a sharp smile that told her to just try, the\nlightning around his knuckles twining up his wrist.\nAnd fortunately for Isaiah, the interrogation room\u2019s door opened and a\ndark-haired woman in an immaculately tailored navy suit walked in.\nThey were a front, those suits that he and Viktoria wore. A sort of\narmor, yes, but also a last attempt to pretend that they were even remotely\nnormal.\nIt was no wonder Hunt never bothered with them.\nAs Viktoria made her graceful approach, Bryce gave no\nacknowledgment of the stunning female who usually made people of all\nHouses do a double take.\nBut Bryce had been that way for hours now. Blood still stained the\nwhite bandage around her bare thigh. Viktoria sniffed delicately, her pale\ngreen eyes narrowing beneath the halo\u2019s dark tattoo on her brow. The wraith\nhad been one of the few non-malakim who had rebelled with them two\ncenturies ago. She\u2019d been given to Micah soon afterward, and her\npunishment had gone beyond the brow tattoo and slave markings. Not\nnearly as brutal as what Isaiah and Hunt had endured in the Asteri\u2019s\ndungeons, and then in various Archangels\u2019 dungeons for years afterward,\nbut its own form of torment that lasted even when their own had stopped.\nViktoria said, \u201cMiss Quinlan.\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t respond.\nThe wraith dragged over a steel chair from the wall and set it on the\nother side of the table. Pulling a file from her jacket, Viktoria crossed her\nlong legs as she perched on the seat.\n\u201cCan you tell me who is responsible for the bloodshed tonight?\u201d\nNot even a hitch of breath. Sabine growled softly.\nThe wraith folded her alabaster hands in her lap, the unnatural\nelegance the only sign of the ancient power that rippled beneath the calm\nsurface.\nVik had no body of her own. Though she\u2019d fought in the 18th, Isaiah\nhad learned her history only when he\u2019d arrived here ten years ago. How\nViktoria had acquired this particular body, who it had once belonged to, he\ndidn\u2019t ask. She hadn\u2019t told him. Wraiths wore bodies the way some people\nowned cars. Vainer wraiths switched them often, usually at the first sign of\naging, but Viktoria had held on to this one for longer than usual, liking its\nbuild and movement, she\u2019d said.\nNow she held on to it because she had no choice. It had been Micah\u2019s\npunishment for her rebellion: to trap her within this body. Forever. No more\nchanging, no more trading up for something newer and sleeker. For two\nhundred years, Vik had been contained, forced to weather the slow erosion\nof the body, now plainly visible: the thin lines starting to carve themselves\naround her eyes, the crease now etched in her forehead above the tattoo\u2019s\ntwining band of thorns.\n\u201cQuinlan\u2019s gone into shock,\u201d Hunt observed, monitoring Bryce\u2019s every\nbreath. \u201cShe\u2019s not going to talk.\u201d\nIsaiah was inclined to agree, until Viktoria opened the file, scanned a\npiece of paper, and said, \u201cI, for one, believe that you are not in full control\nof your body or actions right now.\u201d\nAnd then she read a shopping list of a cocktail of drugs and alcohol\nthat would stop a human\u2019s heart dead. Stop a lesser Vanir\u2019s heart, too, for\nthat matter.\nHunt swore again. \u201cIs there anything she didn\u2019t snort or smoke\ntonight?\u201d\nSabine bristled. \u201cHalf-breed trash\u2014\u201d\nIsaiah threw Hunt a look. All that was needed to convey the request.\nNever an order\u2014he\u2019d never dared to order Hunt around. Not when the\nmale possessed a hair-trigger temper that had left entire imperial fighting\nunits in smoldering cinders. Even with the spells of the halo binding that\nlightning to a tenth of its full strength, Hunt\u2019s skills as a warrior made up\nfor it.\nBut Hunt\u2019s chin dipped, his only sign that he\u2019d agreed to Isaiah\u2019s\nrequest. \u201cYou\u2019ll need to complete some paperwork upstairs, Sabine.\u201d Hunt\nblew out a breath, as if reminding himself that Sabine was a mother who\nhad lost her only child tonight, and added, \u201cIf you want time to yourself,\nyou can take it, but you need to sign\u2014\u201d\n\u201cFuck signing things and fuck time to myself. Crucify the bitch if you\nhave to, but get her to give a statement.\u201d Sabine spat on the tiles at Hunt\u2019s\nbooted feet.\nEther coated Isaiah\u2019s tongue as Hunt gave her the cool stare that served\nas his only warning to opponents on a battlefield. None had ever survived\nwhat happened next.\nSabine seemed to remember that, and wisely stormed into the hall. She\nflexed her hand as she did, four razor-sharp claws appearing, and slashed\nthem through the metal door.\nHunt smiled at her disappearing figure. A target marked. Not today, not\neven tomorrow, but at one point in the future \u2026\nAnd people claimed the shifters got along better with the angels than\nthe Fae.\nViktoria was saying gently to Bryce, \u201cWe have video footage from the\nWhite Raven, confirming your whereabouts. We have footage of you\nwalking home.\u201d\nCameras covered all of Lunathion, with unparalleled visual and audio\ncoverage, but Bryce\u2019s apartment building was old, and the mandatory\nmonitors in the hallways hadn\u2019t been repaired in decades. The landlord\nwould be getting a visit tonight for the code violations that had fucked this\nentire investigation. One tiny sliver of audio was all the building cameras\nhad managed to catch\u2014just the audio. It held nothing beyond what they\nalready knew. The phones of the Pack of Devils had all been destroyed in\nthe attack. Not one message had gone out.\n\u201cWhat we don\u2019t have footage of, Bryce,\u201d Viktoria went on, \u201cis what\nhappened in that apartment. Can you tell me?\u201d\nSlowly, as if she drifted back into her battered body, Bryce turned her\namber eyes to Viktoria.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s her family?\u201d Hunt asked roughly.\n\u201cHuman mother lives with the stepfather in one of the mountain towns\nup north\u2014both peregrini,\u201d Isaiah said. \u201cThe sire wasn\u2019t registered or\nrefused to acknowledge paternity. Fae, obviously. And likely one with some\nstanding, since he bothered to get her civitas status.\u201d\nMost of the offspring born to human mothers took their peregrini rank.\nAnd though Bryce had something of the Fae\u2019s elegant beauty, her face\nmarked her as human\u2014the gold-dusted skin, the smattering of freckles over\nher nose and high cheekbones, the full mouth. Even if the silken flow of red\nhair and arched ears were pure Fae.\n\u201cHave the human parents been notified?\u201d\nIsaiah dragged a hand over his tight brown curls. He\u2019d been awoken by\nhis phone\u2019s shrill ringing at two in the morning, hurtled from the barracks a\nminute after that, and was now starting to feel the effects of a sleepless\nnight. Dawn was likely not far off. \u201cHer mother was hysterical. She asked\nover and over if we knew why they\u2019d attacked the apartment, or if it was\nPhilip Briggs. She saw on the news that he\u2019d been released on a technicality\nand was certain he did this. I have a patrol from the 31st flying out right\nnow; the parents will be airborne within the hour.\u201d\nViktoria\u2019s voice slid through the intercom as she continued her\ninterview. \u201cCan you describe the creature that attacked your friends?\u201d\nBut Quinlan was gone again, her eyes vacant.\nThey had fuzzy footage thanks to the street cameras, but the demon\nhad moved faster than the wind and had known to keep out of lens range.\nThey hadn\u2019t been able to ID it yet\u2014even Hunt\u2019s extensive knowledge\nhadn\u2019t helped. All they had of it was a vague, grayish blur no slowdown\ncould clarify. And Bryce Quinlan, charging barefoot through the city streets.\n\u201cThat girl isn\u2019t ready to give a statement,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cThis is a waste\nof our time.\u201d\nBut Isaiah asked him, \u201cWhy does Sabine hate Bryce so much\u2014why\nimply she\u2019s to blame for all this?\u201d When Hunt didn\u2019t answer, Isaiah jerked\nhis chin toward two files on the edge of the desk. \u201cLook at Quinlan\u2019s. Only\none standing crime before this\u2014for public indecency during a Summer\nSolstice parade. She got a little frisky against a wall and was caught in the\nact. Holding cell overnight, paid the fine the next day, did community\nservice for a month to get it wiped off any permanent record.\u201d Isaiah could\nhave sworn a ghost of a smile appeared on Hunt\u2019s mouth.\nBut Isaiah tapped a calloused finger on the impressively thick stack\nbeside it. \u201cThis is part one of Danika Fendyr\u2019s file. Of seven. Starts with\npetty theft when she was ten, continues until she reached her majority five\nyears ago. Then it goes eerily quiet. If you ask me, Bryce was the one who\nwas led down a road of ruination\u2014and then maybe led Danika out of hers.\u201d\n\u201cNot far enough to keep from snorting enough lightseeker to kill a\nhorse,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cI\u2019m assuming she didn\u2019t party alone. Were there any\nother friends with her tonight?\u201d\n\u201cTwo others. Juniper Andromeda, a faun who\u2019s a soloist at the City\nBallet, and \u2026\u201d Isaiah flipped open the case file and muttered a prayer.\n\u201cFury Axtar.\u201d\nHunt swore softly at the mercenary\u2019s name.\nFury Axtar was licensed to kill in half a dozen countries. Including this\none.\nHunt asked, \u201cFury was with Quinlan tonight?\u201d\nThey\u2019d crossed paths with the merc enough to know to stay the Hel\naway. Micah had even ordered Hunt to kill her. Twice.\nBut she had too many high-powered allies. Some, it was whispered, on\nthe Imperial Senate. So both times, Micah had decided that the fallout over\nthe Umbra Mortis turning Fury Axtar into veritable toast would be more\ntrouble than it was worth.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Isaiah said. \u201cFury was with her at the club.\u201d\nHunt frowned. But Viktoria leaned in to speak to Bryce once more.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to find who did this. Can you give us the information we\nneed?\u201d\nOnly a shell sat before the wraith.\nViktoria said, in that luxurious purr that usually had people eating out\nof her palm, \u201cI want to help you. I want to find who did this. And punish\nthem.\u201d\nViktoria reached into her pocket, pulled out her phone, and set it\nfaceup on the table. Instantly, its digital feed appeared on the small screen\nin the room with Isaiah and Hunt. They glanced between the wraith and the\nscreen as a series of messages opened.\n\u201cWe downloaded the data from your phone. Can you walk me through\nthese?\u201d\nGlassy eyes tracked a small screen that rose from a hidden\ncompartment in the linoleum floor. It displayed the same messages Isaiah\nand Hunt now read.\nThe first one, sent from Bryce, read, TV nights are for waggle-tailed\npups. Come play with the big bitches.\nAnd then a short, dark video, shaking as someone roared with laughter\nwhile Bryce flipped off the camera, leaned over a line of white powder\u2014\nlightseeker\u2014and sniffed it right up her freckled nose. She was laughing, so\nbright and alive that the woman in the room before them looked like a\ngutted corpse, and she shrieked into the camera, \u201cLIGHT IT UP,\nDANIKAAAAA!\u201d\nDanika\u2019s written reply was precisely what Isaiah expected from the\nPrime Apparent of the wolves, whom he\u2019d seen only from a distance at\nformal events and who had seemed poised to start trouble wherever she\nwent: I FUCKING HATE YOU. STOP DOING LIGHTSEEKER WITHOUT\nME. ASSHOLE.\nParty Princess, indeed.\nBryce had written back twenty minutes later, I just hooked up with\nsomeone in the bathroom. Don\u2019t tell Connor.\nHunt shook his head.\nBut Bryce sat there as Viktoria read the messages aloud, the wraith\nstone-faced.\nDanika wrote back, Was it good?!!?\nOnly good enough to take the edge off.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t relevant,\u201d Hunt murmured. \u201cPull in Viktoria.\u201d\n\u201cWe have our orders.\u201d\n\u201cFuck the orders. That woman is about to break, and not in a good\nway.\u201d\nThen Bryce stopped responding to Danika.\nBut Danika kept messaging. One after another. Over the next two\nhours.\nThe show\u2019s over. Where are you assholes?\nWhy aren\u2019t you picking up your phone? I\u2019m calling Fury.\nWhere the FUCK is Fury?\nJuniper never brings her phone, so I\u2019m not even gonna bother with\nher. Where are you?!!!\nShould I come to the club? The pack\u2019s leaving in ten. Stop fucking\nstrangers in the bathroom, because Connor\u2019s coming with me.\nBRYYYYCE. When you look at your phone, I hope the 1,000 alerts piss\nyou off.\nThorne is telling me to stop messaging you. I told him to mind his own\nfucking business.\nConnor says to grow the Hel up and stop doing shady-ass drugs,\nbecause only losers do that shit. He wasn\u2019t happy when I said I\u2019m not sure I\ncan let you date a holier-than-thou priss.\nOkay, we\u2019re leaving in five. See you soon, cocksucker. Light it up.\nBryce stared at the screen unblinkingly, her torn face sickly pale in the\nlight of the monitor.\n\u201cThe building\u2019s cameras are mostly broken, but the one in the hall was\nstill able to record some audio, though its video footage was down,\u201d\nViktoria said calmly. \u201cShall I play it?\u201d\nNo response. So Viktoria played it.\nMuffled snarling and screaming filled the speakers\u2014quiet enough that\nit was clear the hall camera had picked up only the loudest noises coming\nfrom the apartment. And then someone was roaring\u2014a feral wolf\u2019s roar.\n\u201cPlease, please\u2014\u201d\nThe words were cut off. But the hall camera\u2019s audio wasn\u2019t.\nDanika Fendyr screamed. Something tumbled and crashed in the\nbackground\u2014as if she\u2019d been thrown into furniture. And the hall camera\nkept recording.\nThe screaming went on, and on, and on. Interrupted only by the\ncamera\u2019s fritzed system. The muffled grunts and growls were wet and\nvicious, and Danika was begging, sobbing as she pleaded for mercy, wept\nand screamed for it to stop\u2014\n\u201cTurn it off,\u201d Hunt ordered, stalking from the room. \u201cTurn it off now.\u201d\nHe was out so fast Isaiah couldn\u2019t stop him, instantly crossing the space to\nthe door beside theirs and flinging it open before Isaiah had cleared the\nroom.\nBut there was Danika, audio crackling in and out, the sound of her\nvoice still pleading for mercy coming from the speakers in the ceiling.\nDanika, being devoured and shredded.\nThe silence from the murderer was as chilling as Danika\u2019s sobbing\nscreams.\nViktoria twisted toward the door as Hunt barreled in, his face dark with\nfury, wings spreading. The Shadow of Death unleashed.\nIsaiah tasted ether. Lightning writhed at Hunt\u2019s fingertips.\nDanika\u2019s unending, half-muffled screams filled the room.\nIsaiah stepped into the chamber in time to see Bryce explode.\nHe summoned a wall of wind around himself and Vik, Hunt no doubt\ndoing the same, as Bryce shot out of her chair and flipped the table. It\nsoared over Viktoria\u2019s head and slammed into the observation window.\nA feral growl filled the room as she grabbed the chair she\u2019d been\nsitting on, hurling it against the wall, so hard its metal frame dented and\ncrumpled.\nShe vomited all over the floor. If his power hadn\u2019t been around\nViktoria, it would have showered her absurdly expensive bespoke heels.\nThe audio finally cut off when the hall camera went on the fritz again\n\u2014and stayed that way.\nBryce panted, staring at her mess. Then fell to her knees in it.\nShe puked again. And again. And then curled over her knees, her silky\nhair falling into the vomit as she rocked herself in the stunned silence.\nShe was half-Fae, assessed at a power level barely on the grid. What\nshe\u2019d just done to the table and chair \u2026 Pure, physical rage. Even the most\naloof of the Fae couldn\u2019t halt an eruption of primal wrath when it overtook\nthem.\nUnfazed, Hunt approached her, his gray wings high to avoid dragging\nthrough the vomit.\n\u201cHey.\u201d Hunt knelt at Bryce\u2019s side. He reached for her shoulder, but\nlowered his hand. How many people ever saw the hands of the Umbra\nMortis reach for them with no hint of violence?\nHunt nodded toward the destroyed table and chair. \u201cImpressive.\u201d\nBryce bowed farther over herself, her tan fingers near-white as they\ndug into her back hard enough to bruise. Her voice was a broken rasp. \u201cI\nwant to go home.\u201d\nHunt\u2019s dark eyes flickered. But he said nothing more.\nViktoria, frowning at the mess, slipped away to find someone to clean\nit.\nIsaiah said, \u201cYou can\u2019t go home, I\u2019m afraid. It\u2019s an active crime\nscene.\u201d And it was so wrecked that even if they scrubbed it with bleach, no\nVanir would be able to walk in and not scent the slaughter. \u201cIt\u2019s not safe for\nyou to return until we\u2019ve found who did this. And why they did it.\u201d\nThen Bryce breathed, \u201cDoes S-Sabine\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Isaiah said gently. \u201cEveryone who was in Danika\u2019s life has been\nnotified.\u201d\nThe entire world would know in a few hours.\nStill kneeling beside her, Hunt said roughly, \u201cWe can move you to a\nroom with a cot and a bathroom. Get you some clothes.\u201d\nHer dress was so torn that most of her skin was on display, a rip along\nthe waist revealing the hint of a dark tattoo down her back. He\u2019d seen\nwhores in the Meat Market wearing more modest clothes.\nThe phone in Isaiah\u2019s pocket buzzed. Naomi. The voice of the captain\nof the 33rd\u2019s infantry was strained when Isaiah answered. \u201cLet the girl go.\nRight now. Get her out of this building, and for all our sakes, do not put\nanyone on her tail. Especially Hunt.\u201d\n\u201cWhy? The Governor gave us the opposite order.\u201d\n\u201cI got a phone call,\u201d Naomi said. \u201cFrom Ruhn fucking Danaan. He\u2019s\nlivid that we didn\u2019t notify Sky and Breath about bringing in the girl. Says it\nfalls under the Fae\u2019s jurisdiction and whatever the fuck else. So screw what\nthe Governor wants\u2014he\u2019ll thank us later for avoiding this enormous\nfucking headache. Let the girl go now. She can come back in with a Fae\nescort, if that\u2019s what those assholes want.\u201d\nHunt, having heard the entire conversation, studied Bryce Quinlan\nwith a predator\u2019s unflinching assessment. As one of the triarii, Naomi\nBoreas answered only to Micah and owed them no explanation, but to\ndisregard his direct order in favor of the Fae \u2026 Naomi added, \u201cDo it,\nIsaiah.\u201d Then she hung up.\nDespite Bryce\u2019s pointed Fae ears, her glazed eyes registered no sign\nthat she\u2019d heard.\nIsaiah pocketed his phone. \u201cYou\u2019re free to go.\u201d\nShe uncurled on surprisingly steady legs, despite the bandage on one\nof them. Yet blood and dirt caked her bare feet. Enough of the former that\nHunt said, \u201cWe\u2019ve got a medwitch on-site.\u201d\nBut Bryce ignored him and limped out, through the open door and into\nthe hall.\nHis eyes fixed on the doorway as the scuffle-hop of her steps faded.\nFor a long minute, neither of them spoke. Then Hunt blew out a breath\nand rose. \u201cWhat room is Naomi putting Briggs in?\u201d\nIsaiah didn\u2019t get the chance to answer before footsteps sounded down\nthe hall, approaching fast. Definitely not Bryce\u2019s.\nEven in one of the most secure places in this city, Isaiah and Hunt\npositioned their hands within easy reach of their weapons, the former\ncrossing his arms so that he might draw the gun hidden beneath his suit\njacket, the latter letting his hand dangle at his thigh, inches from the black-\nhilted knife sheathed there. Lightning again writhed at Hunt\u2019s fingers.\nA dark-haired Fae male burst through the interrogation room door.\nEven with a silver hoop through his lower lip, even with one side of his\nlong raven-black hair buzzed, even with the sleeves of tattoos beneath the\nleather jacket, there was no disguising the heritage the strikingly handsome\nface broadcasted.\nRuhn Danaan, Crown Prince of the Valbaran Fae. Son of the Autumn\nKing and the current possessor of the Starsword, fabled dark blade of the\nancient Starborn Fae. Proof of the prince\u2019s Chosen One status among the\nFae\u2014whatever the Hel that meant.\nThat sword was currently strapped across Ruhn\u2019s back, its black hilt\ndevouring the glaring firstlights. Isaiah had once heard someone say the\nsword was made from iridium mined from a meteorite, forged in another\nworld\u2014before the Fae had come through the Northern Rift.\nDanaan\u2019s blue eyes simmered like the heart of a flame\u2014though Ruhn\nhimself bore no such magic. Fire magic was common among the Valbaran\nFae, wielded by the Autumn King himself. But rumor claimed Ruhn\u2019s\nmagic was more like those of his kin who ruled the sacred Fae isle of\nAvallen across the sea: power to summon shadows or mist that could not\nonly veil the physical world, but the mind as well. Perhaps even telepathy.\nRuhn glanced at the vomit, scenting the female who\u2019d just left. \u201cWhere\nthe fuck is she?\u201d\nHunt went still at the cold command in the prince\u2019s voice.\n\u201cBryce Quinlan has been released,\u201d Isaiah said. \u201cWe sent her upstairs a\nfew minutes ago.\u201d\nRuhn had to have taken a side entrance if he\u2019d missed her, and they\nhadn\u2019t been warned by the front desk of his arrival. Perhaps he\u2019d used that\nmagic of his to worm through the shadows.\nThe prince turned toward the doorway, but Hunt said, \u201cWhat\u2019s it to\nyou?\u201d\nRuhn bristled. \u201cShe\u2019s my cousin, asshole. We take care of our own.\u201d\nA distant cousin, since the Autumn King had no siblings, but\napparently the prince knew Bryce well enough to intervene.\nHunt threw Ruhn a grin. \u201cWhere were you tonight?\u201d\n\u201cFuck you, Athalar.\u201d Ruhn bared his teeth. \u201cI suppose you heard that\nDanika and I got into it over Briggs at the Head meeting. What a lead. Good\njob.\u201d Each word came out more clipped than the last. \u201cIf I wanted to kill\nDanika, I wouldn\u2019t summon a fucking demon to do it. Where the fuck is\nBriggs? I want to talk to him.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s incoming.\u201d Hunt was still smiling. That lightning still danced at\nhis knuckles. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t get the first shot at him.\u201d Then he added,\n\u201cDaddy\u2019s clout and cash only get you so far, Prince.\u201d\nIt made no difference that Ruhn headed up the Fae division of the Aux,\nand was as well trained as any of their elite fighters. Or that the sword on\nhis back wasn\u2019t merely decorative.\nIt didn\u2019t matter to Hunt. Not where royals and rigid hierarchies were\nconcerned.\nRuhn said, \u201cKeep talking, Athalar. Let\u2019s see where it gets you.\u201d\nHunt smirked. \u201cI\u2019m shaking.\u201d\nIsaiah cleared his throat. Burning Solas, the last thing he needed\ntonight was a brawl between one of his triarii and a prince of the Fae. He\nsaid to Ruhn, \u201cCan you tell us if Miss Quinlan\u2019s behavior before the murder\ntonight was unusual or\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThe Raven\u2019s owner told me she was drunk and had snorted a pile of\nlightseeker,\u201d Ruhn snapped. \u201cBut you\u2019ll find Bryce with that kind of shit in\nher system at least one night a week.\u201d\n\u201cWhy does she do it at all?\u201d Isaiah asked.\nRuhn crossed his arms. \u201cShe does what she wants. She always has.\u201d\nThere was enough bitterness there to suggest history\u2014bad history.\nHunt drawled, \u201cJust how close are you two?\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019re asking whether I\u2019m fucking her,\u201d Ruhn seethed, \u201cthe\nanswer, asshole, is no. She\u2019s family.\u201d\n\u201cDistant family,\u201d Hunt pointed out. \u201cI heard the Fae like to keep their\nbloodline undiluted.\u201d\nRuhn held his stare. And as Hunt smiled again, ether filled the room,\nthe promise of a storm skittering over Isaiah\u2019s skin.\nWondering if he\u2019d be dumb enough to get between them when Ruhn\nattempted to bash in Hunt\u2019s teeth and Hunt turned the prince into a pile of\nsmoldering bones, Isaiah said quickly, \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to do our job,\nPrince.\u201d\n\u201cIf you assholes had kept an eye on Briggs like you were supposed to,\nmaybe this wouldn\u2019t have happened at all.\u201d\nHunt\u2019s gray wings flared slightly\u2014a malakh\u2019s usual stance when\npreparing for a physical fight. And those dark eyes \u2026 They were the eyes\nof the feared warrior, the Fallen angel. The one who had smashed apart the\nbattlefields he\u2019d been ordered to fight on. The one who killed on an\nArchangel\u2019s whim, and did it so well they called him the Shadow of Death.\n\u201cCareful,\u201d Hunt said.\n\u201cStay the fuck away from Bryce,\u201d Ruhn snarled before striding back\nthrough the door, presumably after his cousin. At least Bryce would have an\nescort.\nHunt flipped off the empty doorway. After a moment, he murmured,\n\u201cThe tracking device in the water Quinlan drank when she got here. What\u2019s\nthe time frame on it?\u201d\n\u201cThree days,\u201d Isaiah replied.\nHunt studied the knife sheathed at his thigh. \u201cDanika Fendyr was one\nof the strongest Vanir in the city, even without making the Drop. She\nbegged like a human by the end.\u201d\nSabine would never recover from the shame.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know of a demon that kills like that,\u201d Hunt mused. \u201cOr\ndisappears that easily. I couldn\u2019t find a trace. It\u2019s like it vanished back to\nHel.\u201d\nIsaiah said, \u201cIf Briggs is behind it, we\u2019ll learn what the demon is soon\nenough.\u201d\nIf Briggs talked at all. He certainly hadn\u2019t when he\u2019d been busted in\nhis bomb lab, despite the best efforts of the 33rd\u2019s interrogators and the\nAux.\nIsaiah added, \u201cI\u2019ll have every available patrol quietly looking out for\nother young packs in the Auxiliary. If it winds up not being related to\nBriggs, then it could be the start of a pattern.\u201d\nHunt asked darkly, \u201cIf we find the demon?\u201d\nIsaiah shrugged. \u201cThen make sure it\u2019s not a problem anymore, Hunt.\u201d\nHunt\u2019s eyes sharpened into lethal focus. \u201cAnd Bryce Quinlan\u2014after\nthe three days are up?\u201d\nIsaiah frowned at the table, the crumpled chair. \u201cIf she\u2019s smart, she\u2019ll\nlie low and not attract the attention of any other powerful immortals for the\nrest of her life.\u201d"}, "7": {"Name": "PART I THE HOLLOW-Chapter 7", "Page Content": " \nThe black steps ringing the foggy shore of the Bone Quarter bit into Bryce\u2019s\nknees as she knelt before the towering ivory gates.\nThe Istros spread like a gray mirror behind her, silent in the predawn\nlight.\nAs quiet and still as she had gone, hollowed out and drifting.\nMist curled around her, veiling all but the obsidian steps she knelt on\nand the carved bone gates looming overhead. The rotting black boat at her\nback was her only companion, its moldy, ancient rope draped over the steps\nin lieu of a mooring. She\u2019d paid the fee\u2014the boat would linger here until\nshe was done. Until she had said what she needed to say.\nThe living realm remained a world away, the spires and skyscrapers of\nthe city hidden by that swirling mist, its car horns and array of voices\nrendered mute. She\u2019d left behind any mortal possessions. They would have\nno value here, among the Reapers and the dead.\nShe\u2019d been glad to leave them\u2014especially her phone, so full of anger\nand hatred.\nIthan\u2019s latest audiomail had come only an hour ago, stirring her from\nthe unsleeping stupor in which she\u2019d spent the past six nights, staring at the\ndark ceiling of the hotel room she was sharing with her mother. Ignoring\nevery call and message.\nIthan\u2019s words had lingered, though, when she\u2019d slipped into the hotel\nbathroom to listen.\nDon\u2019t come to the Sailing tomorrow. You\u2019re not welcome there.\nShe\u2019d listened to it over and over, the first words to echo in her silent\nhead.\nHer mother hadn\u2019t woken from the bed beside hers when Bryce had\nexited the hotel room on Fae-soft feet, taking the service elevator and\nleaving through the unwatched alley door. She hadn\u2019t left that room for six\ndays, just sat staring vacantly at the floral hotel wallpaper. And now, with\nthe seventh dawning \u2026 Only for this would she leave. Would she remember\nhow to move her body, how to speak.\nDanika\u2019s Sailing would commence at dawn, and the Sailings for the\nrest of the pack would follow. Bryce would not be there to witness them.\nEven without the wolves banning her from it, she couldn\u2019t have endured it.\nTo see the black boat pushed from the dock, all that was left of Danika with\nit, her soul to be judged either worthy or unworthy of entering the sacred\nisle across the river.\nThere was only silence here. Silence and mist.\nWas this death? Silence and fog?\nBryce ran her tongue over her dry, chapped lips. She did not remember\nthe last time she\u2019d drunk anything. Had a meal. Only her mother coaxing\nher to take a sip of water.\nA light had gone out inside her. A light had been extinguished.\nShe might as well have been staring inside herself: Darkness. Silence.\nMist.\nBryce lifted her head, peering up toward the carved bone gates, hewn\nfrom the ribs of a long-dead leviathan who\u2019d prowled the deep seas of the\nnorth. The mist swirled tighter, the temperature dropping. Announcing the\narrival of something ancient and terrible.\nBryce remained kneeling. Bowed her head.\nShe was not welcome at the Sailing. So she had come here to say\ngoodbye. To give Danika this one last thing.\nThe creature that dwelt in the mist emerged, and even the river at her\nback trembled.\nBryce opened her eyes. And slowly lifted her gaze.\nPART II\nTHE TRENCH"}, "8": {"Name": "PART II THE TRENCH-Chapter 8", "Page Content": " \nTWENTY-TWO MONTHS LATER\nBryce Quinlan stumbled from the White Raven\u2019s bathroom, a lion shifter\nnuzzling her neck, his broad hands grabbing at her waist.\nIt was easily the best sex she\u2019d had in three months. Maybe longer\nthan that. Maybe she\u2019d keep him for a while.\nMaybe she should learn his name first. Not that it mattered. Her\nmeeting was at the VIP bar across the club in \u2026 well, shit. Right now.\nThe beat of the music pounded against her bones, echoing off the\ncarved pillars, an incessant summons that Bryce ignored, denied. Just as she\nhad every day for the past two years.\n\u201cLet\u2019s dance.\u201d The golden-haired lion\u2019s words rumbled against her ear\nas he gripped her hand to drag her toward the teeming throng on the ancient\nstones of the dance floor.\nShe planted her feet as firmly as her four-inch stilettos would allow.\n\u201cNo, thanks. I\u2019ve got a business meeting.\u201d Not a lie, though she would have\nturned him down regardless.\nThe corner of the lion\u2019s lip twitched as he surveyed her short-as-sin\nblack dress, the bare legs she\u2019d had wrapped around his waist moments ago.\nUrd spare her, his cheekbones were unreal. So were those golden eyes, now\nnarrowing in amusement. \u201cYou go to business meetings looking like that?\u201d\nShe did when her boss\u2019s clients insisted on meeting in a neutral space\nlike the Raven, fearful of whatever monitoring or spells Jesiba had at the\ngallery.\nBryce never would have come here\u2014had so rarely come back here at\nall\u2014on her own. She\u2019d been sipping sparkling water at the normal bar\nwithin the club, not the VIP one she was supposed to be sitting at on the\nmezzanine, when the lion approached her with that easy smile and those\nbroad shoulders. She\u2019d been in such need of a distraction from the tension\nbuilding in her with each moment in here that she\u2019d barely finished her\nglass before she\u2019d dragged him into the bathroom. He\u2019d been all too happy\nto oblige her.\nBryce said to the lion, \u201cThanks for the ride.\u201d Whatever your name is.\nIt took him a blink to realize she was serious about the business\nmeeting. Red crept over his tanned cheeks. Then he blurted, \u201cI can\u2019t pay\nyou.\u201d\nIt was her turn to blink. Then she tipped her head back and laughed.\nJust perfect: he thought she was one of the whores in Riso\u2019s employ.\nSacred prostitution, Riso had once explained\u2014since the club lay on the\nruins of a temple to pleasure, it was his duty to continue its traditions.\n\u201cConsider it on the house,\u201d she crooned, patting him on the cheek\nbefore she turned toward the glowing golden bar on the glass mezzanine\nhovering over the cavernous space.\nShe didn\u2019t let herself look toward the booth tucked between two age-\nworn pillars. Didn\u2019t let herself see who might now be occupying it. Not\nJuniper, who was too busy these days for more than the occasional brunch,\nand certainly not Fury, who didn\u2019t bother to take her calls, or answer\nmessages, or even visit this city.\nBryce rolled her shoulders, shoving the thoughts away.\nThe jaguar shifters standing guard atop the illuminated golden\nstaircase that linked the VIP mezzanine with the converted temple pulled\naside their black velvet rope to let her pass. Twenty glass stools flanked the\nsolid gold bar, and only a third of them were occupied. Vanir of every\nHouse sat in them. No humans, though.\nExcept for her, if she even counted.\nHer client was already seated at the far end of the bar, his dark suit\ntight over his bulky frame, long black hair slicked back to reveal a sharp-\nboned face and inky eyes.\nBryce rattled off his details to herself as she sauntered up to him,\npraying he wasn\u2019t the sort to mark that she was technically two minutes\nlate.\nMaximus Tertian: two-hundred-year-old vampyr; unwed and unmated;\nson of Lord Cedrian, richest of the Pangeran vamps and the most\nmonstrous, if rumor was to be believed. Known for filling bathtubs with the\nblood of human maidens in his frosty mountain keep, bathing in their youth\n\u2014\nNot helpful. Bryce plastered on a smile and claimed the stool beside\nhis, ordering a sparkling water from the bartender. \u201cMr. Tertian,\u201d she said\nby way of greeting, extending her hand.\nThe vampyr\u2019s smile was so smooth she knew ten thousand pairs of\nunderwear had likely dropped at the sight of it over the centuries. \u201cMiss\nQuinlan,\u201d he purred, taking her hand and brushing a kiss to the back of it.\nHis lips lingered just long enough that she suppressed the urge to yank her\nfingers back. \u201cA pleasure to meet you in the flesh.\u201d His eyes dipped toward\nher neck, then the cleavage exposed by her dress. \u201cYour employer might\nhave a gallery full of art, but you are the true masterpiece.\u201d\nOh please.\nBryce ducked her head, making herself smile. \u201cYou say that to all the\ngirls.\u201d\n\u201cOnly the mouthwatering ones.\u201d\nAn offer for how this night could end, if she wanted: being sucked and\nfucked. She didn\u2019t bother to inform him she\u2019d already had that particular\nneed scratched, minus the sucking. She liked her blood where it was, thank\nyou very much.\nShe reached into her purse, pulling out a narrow leather folio\u2014an\nexact replica of what the Raven used to hand out steep bills to its most\nexclusive patrons. \u201cYour drink\u2019s on me.\u201d She slid the folio toward him with\na smile.\nMaximus peered at the ownership papers for the five-thousand-year-\nold onyx bust of a long-dead vampyr lord. The deal had been a triumph for\nBryce after weeks of sending out feelers to potential buyers, taunting them\nwith the chance to buy a rare artifact before any of their rivals. She\u2019d had\nher eye on Maximus, and during their endless phone calls and messages,\nshe\u2019d played him well, drawing upon his hatred for other vampyr lords, his\nfragile ego, his unbearable arrogance.\nIt was an effort now to suppress her smile as Maximus\u2014never Max\u2014\nnodded while he read. Giving him the illusion of privacy, Bryce pivoted on\nthe stool to peer at the teeming club below.\nA cluster of young females adorned in firstlight glow-stick halos\ndanced together near a pillar, laughing and singing and passing a bottle of\nsparkling wine among them.\nBryce\u2019s chest tightened. She\u2019d once planned to have her Drop party at\nthe Raven. Had planned to be as obnoxious as those females down there,\npartying with her friends from the moment she emerged from the Ascent\nuntil she either passed out or was kicked to the curb.\nThe party, honestly, was what she\u2019d wanted to focus on. What most\npeople tried to focus on. Rather than the sheer terror of the Drop ritual\nitself.\nBut it was a necessary rite. Because the firstlight grid\u2019s power was\ngenerated by the pure, undiluted light each Vanir emitted while making the\nDrop. And it was only during the Drop that the flash of firstlight appeared\n\u2014raw, unfiltered magic. It could heal and destroy and do everything in\nbetween.\nCaptured and bottled, the first glow was always used for healing, then\nthe rest of it was handed over to the energy plants to fuel their lights and\ncars and machines and tech; some of it was used for spells, and some was\nreserved for whatever shady shit the Republic wanted.\nThe \u201cdonation\u201d of the firstlight by each citizen was a key element of\nthe Drop ritual, part of why it was always done in a government center: a\nsterile room, where the light from the person making the Drop was gobbled\nup during the transition into immortality and true power. All tracked by the\nEleusian system, able to monitor every moment of it through vibrations in\nthe world\u2019s magic. Indeed, family members sometimes watched the feeds in\nan adjacent room.\nThe Drop was the easy part: falling into one\u2019s power. But once the\nbottom was reached, one\u2019s mortal body expired. And then the clock began\ncounting down.\nMere minutes were allowed for the race back up to life\u2014before the\nbrain shut down permanently from lack of oxygen. Six minutes to start\nbarreling down a psychic runway along the bottom of one\u2019s power, a single\ndesperate shot at launching skyward toward life. The alternative to\nsuccessfully making that leap: tumbling into an endless black pit and\nawaiting death. The alternative to getting enough momentum on that\nrunway: tumbling into an endless black pit and awaiting death.\nWhich was why someone else had to act as an Anchor: a beacon, a\nlifeline, a bungee cord that would snap their companion back up to life once\nthey leapt off the runway. To make the Drop alone was to die\u2014to reach the\nbottom of one\u2019s power, to have one\u2019s heart stop beating upon hitting that\nnadir. No one knew if the soul continued living down there, lost forever, or\nif it died along with the body left in life.\nIt was why Anchors were usually family\u2014parents or siblings\u2014or\ntrusted friends. Someone who wouldn\u2019t leave you stranded. Or a\ngovernment employee who had a legal obligation not to do so. Some\nclaimed those six minutes were called the Search\u2014that during that time,\nyou faced the very depths of your soul. But beyond that, there was no hope\nof survival.\nIt was only upon making the Ascent and reaching that threshold back\nto life, brimming with new power, that immortality was attained, the aging\nprocess slowed to a glacial drip and the body rendered near-indestructible\nas it was bathed in all that ensuing firstlight, so bright it could blind the\nnaked eye. And at the end of it, when the Drop Center\u2019s sleek energy panels\nhad siphoned off that firstlight, all any of them were left with to mark the\noccasion was a mere pinprick of that light in a bottle. A pretty souvenir.\nThese days, with Drop parties like the one below all the rage, the\nnewly immortal often used their allotment of their own firstlight to make\nparty favors to hand out to their friends. Bryce had planned for glow sticks\nand key chains that said Kiss My Sparkly Ass! Danika had just wanted shot\nglasses.\nBryce tucked away that old ache in her chest as Maximus shut the folio\nwith a snap, his reading done. A matching folio appeared in his hand, then\nhe nudged it across the shining gold surface of the bar.\nBryce glanced at the check within\u2014for a mind-boggling sum that he\nhanded over as if passing her an empty gum wrapper\u2014and smiled again.\nEven as some small part of her cringed at the tiny fact that she wouldn\u2019t\nreceive any part of her commission on the piece. On any art in Jesiba\u2019s\ngallery. That money went elsewhere.\n\u201cA pleasure doing business with you, Mr. Tertian.\u201d\nThere. Done. Time to go home and climb into bed and snuggle with\nSyrinx. The best form of celebrating she could think of these days.\nBut a pale, strong hand landed on the folio. \u201cGoing so soon?\u201d\nMaximus\u2019s smile grew again. \u201cIt\u2019d be a shame for a pretty thing like you to\nleave when I was about to order a bottle of Serat.\u201d The sparkling wine from\nthe south of Valbara started at roughly a hundred gold marks a bottle. And\napparently made pricks like him believe they were entitled to female\ncompany.\nBryce gave him a wink, trying to pull the folio with the check toward\nher awaiting purse. \u201cI think you\u2019d be the one feeling sorry if a pretty thing\nlike me left, Mr. Tertian.\u201d\nHis hand remained on the folio. \u201cFor what I paid your boss, I\u2019d think\nsome perks came with this deal.\u201d\nWell, it had to be a record: being mistaken for a whore twice within ten\nminutes. She had no disdain for the world\u2019s oldest profession, only respect\nand sometimes pity, but being mistaken for one of them had led to more\nunfortunate incidents than she liked. Yet Bryce managed to say calmly, \u201cI\u2019m\nafraid I have another meeting.\u201d\nMaximus\u2019s hand slipped to her wrist, gripping hard enough to\ndemonstrate that he could snap every bone inside it with barely a thought.\nShe refused to allow her scent to shift as her stomach hollowed out.\nShe had dealt with his kind and worse. \u201cTake your hand off me, please.\u201d\nShe added the last word because she owed it to Jesiba to at least sound\npolite\u2014just once.\nBut Maximus surveyed her body with all the male, immortal\nentitlement in the world. \u201cSome like their prey to play hard to get.\u201d He\nsmiled up at her again. \u201cI happen to be one of them. I\u2019ll make it good for\nyou, you know.\u201d\nShe met his stare, hating that some small part of her wanted to recoil.\nThat it recognized him as a predator and her as his prey and she\u2019d be lucky\nto even get the chance to run before she was eaten whole. \u201cNo, thank you.\u201d\nThe VIP mezzanine went quiet, the ripple of silence a sure sign that\nsome bigger, badder predator had prowled in. Good.\nMaybe it\u2019d distract the vampyr long enough for her to snatch her wrist\nback. And that check. Jesiba would flay her alive if she left without it.\nIndeed, Maximus\u2019s gaze drifted over her shoulder to whoever had\nentered. His hand tightened on Bryce\u2019s. Just hard enough that Bryce looked.\nA dark-haired Fae male stalked up to the other end of the bar. Looking\nright at her.\nShe tried not to groan. And not the way she\u2019d groaned with that lion\nshifter.\nThe Fae male kept looking at her as Maximus\u2019s upper lip pulled back\nfrom his teeth, revealing the elongated canines he so badly wanted to sink\ninto her. Maximus snarled in warning. \u201cYou are mine.\u201d The words were so\nguttural she could barely understand him.\nBryce sighed through her nose as the Fae male took a seat at the bar,\nmurmuring his drink order to the silver-haired sylph behind it. \u201cThat\u2019s my\ncousin,\u201d Bryce said. \u201cRelax.\u201d\nThe vampyr blinked. \u201cWhat?\u201d\nHis surprise cost him: his grip loosened, and Bryce stashed the folio\nwith the check in her purse as she stepped back. At least her Fae heritage\nwas good for moving quickly when necessary. Walking away, Bryce purred\nover a shoulder, \u201cJust so you know\u2014I don\u2019t do possessive and aggressive.\u201d\nMaximus snarled again, but he\u2019d seen who her \u201ccousin\u201d was. He didn\u2019t\ndare follow.\nEven when the world thought they were only distantly related, one\ndidn\u2019t fuck with the relatives of Ruhn Danaan.\nIf they had known Ruhn was her brother\u2014well, technically her half\nbrother\u2014no male would ever go near her. But thankfully, the world thought\nhe was her cousin, and she was glad to keep it that way. Not just because of\nwho their sire was and the secrecy that she\u2019d long ago sworn to maintain.\nNot just because Ruhn was the legitimate child, the fucking Chosen One,\nand she was \u2026 not.\nRuhn was already sipping from his whiskey, his striking blue eyes\nfixed on Maximus. Promising death.\nShe was half-tempted to let Ruhn send Maximus scurrying back to his\ndaddy\u2019s castle of horrors, but she\u2019d worked so hard on the deal, had tricked\nthe asshole into paying nearly a third more than the bust was worth. All it\nwould take was one phone call from Maximus to his banker and that check\nin her purse would be dead on arrival.\nSo Bryce went up to Ruhn, drawing his attention from the vampyr at\nlast.\nHer brother\u2019s black T-shirt and dark jeans were tight enough to show\noff the muscles Fae went to pieces over, and that plenty of people on the\nVIP level were now ogling. The tattooed sleeves on his golden-skinned\narms, however, were colorful and beautiful enough to piss off their father.\nAlong with the line of rings in one arched ear, and the straight black hair\nthat flowed to his waist save for one shaved side. All painting a glaring\nbillboard that said Fuck You, Dad!\nBut Ruhn was still a Fae male. Still fifty years older than her. Still a\ndomineering dick whenever she ran into him or his friends. Which was\nwhenever she couldn\u2019t avoid it.\n\u201cWell, well, well,\u201d Bryce said, nodding her thanks to the bartender as\nanother sparkling water appeared before her. She took a swig, swishing the\nbubbles to rinse away the lingering taste of lion and alphahole. \u201cLook who\ndecided to stop frequenting poseur rock clubs and start hanging with the\ncool kids. Seems like the Chosen One\u2019s finally getting hip.\u201d\n\u201cI always forget how annoying you are,\u201d Ruhn said by way of\ngreeting. \u201cAnd not that it\u2019s any of your business, but I\u2019m not here to party.\u201d\nBryce surveyed her brother. No sign of the Starsword tonight\u2014and,\nglancing at him, beyond the telltale physical heritage of the Starborn line,\nlittle declared that he\u2019d been anointed by Luna or genetics to usher their\npeople to greater heights. But it had been years since they\u2019d really spoken.\nMaybe Ruhn had crawled back into the fold. It\u2019d be a shame, considering\nthe shit that had gone down to pull him out of it in the first place.\nBryce asked, \u201cIs there a reason why you\u2019re here, other than to ruin my\nnight?\u201d\nRuhn snorted. \u201cStill happy playing slutty secretary, I see.\u201d\nSpoiled prick. For a few glittering years, they\u2019d been best friends, a\ndynamic duo against Motherfucker Number One\u2014aka the Fae male who\u2019d\nsired them\u2014but that was ancient history. Ruhn had seen to that.\nShe frowned at the packed club below, scanning the crowd for any sign\nof the two friends who trailed Ruhn everywhere, both pains in her ass.\n\u201cHow\u2019d you get in here, anyway?\u201d Even a Fae Prince had to wait in line at\nthe Raven. Bryce had once delighted in watching preening Fae assholes be\nturned away at the doors.\n\u201cRiso\u2019s my buddy,\u201d Ruhn said. \u201cHe and I play poker on Tuesday\nnights.\u201d\nOf course Ruhn had somehow managed to befriend the club\u2019s owner.\nA rare breed of butterfly shifter, what Riso lacked in size he made up for\nwith sheer personality, always laughing, always flitting about the club and\ndancing above the crowd. Feeding off its merriment as if it were nectar. He\nwas picky about his close circle, though\u2014he liked to cultivate interesting\ngroups of people to entertain him. Bryce and Danika had never made the\ncut, but odds were that Fury was in that poker group. Too bad Fury didn\u2019t\nanswer her calls for Bryce to even ask about it.\nRuhn bared his teeth at Maximus as the glowering vamp headed\ntoward the golden steps. \u201cRiso called me a few minutes ago and said you\nwere here. With that fucking creep.\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Her voice sharpened. It had nothing to do with the fact\nthat she highly doubted the diplomatic club owner had used those terms.\nRiso was more the type to say, She\u2019s with someone who might cause the\ndancing to cease. Which would have been Riso\u2019s idea of Hel.\nRuhn said, \u201cRiso can\u2019t risk tossing Tertian to the curb\u2014he implied the\nprick was being handsy and you needed backup.\u201d A purely predatory gleam\nentered her brother\u2019s eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t you know what Tertian\u2019s father does?\u201d\nShe grinned, and knew it didn\u2019t reach her eyes. None of her smiles did\nthese days. \u201cI do,\u201d she said sweetly.\nRuhn shook his head in disgust. Bryce leaned forward to grab her\ndrink, each movement controlled\u2014if only to keep from taking the water\nand throwing it in his face.\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t you be home?\u201d Ruhn asked. \u201cIt\u2019s a weekday. You\u2019ve got\nwork in six hours.\u201d\n\u201cThanks, Mom,\u201d she said. But getting home and taking off her bra did\nsound fantastic. She\u2019d been up before dawn again, sweat-soaked and\nbreathless, and the day hadn\u2019t improved from there. Maybe she\u2019d be\nexhausted enough tonight to actually sleep.\nBut when Ruhn made no move to leave, Bryce sighed. \u201cLet\u2019s hear it,\nthen.\u201d\nThere had to be another reason why Ruhn had bothered to come\u2014\nthere always was, considering who had sired them.\nRuhn sipped from his drink. \u201cThe Autumn King wants you to lie low.\nThe Summit meeting is in just over a month, and he wants any loose\ncannons tied down.\u201d\n\u201cWhat does the Summit meeting have to do with me?\u201d They occurred\nevery ten years, a gathering of Valbara\u2019s ruling powers to debate whatever\nissues or policies the Asteri ordered them to deal with. Each territory in the\nRepublic held its own Summit meeting on a rotating schedule, so that one\noccurred in the world each year\u2014and Bryce had paid attention to exactly\nzero of them.\n\u201cThe Autumn King wants everyone associated with the Fae on their\nbest behavior\u2014rumor says the Asteri are sending over some of their\nfavored commanders, and he wants us all looking like good, obedient\nsubjects. Honestly, I don\u2019t fucking care, Bryce. I was just ordered to tell you\nto not \u2026 get into trouble until the meeting\u2019s over.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean, don\u2019t do anything embarrassing.\u201d\n\u201cBasically,\u201d he said, drinking again. \u201cAnd look: beyond that, shit\nalways gets intense around the Summit meetings, so be careful, okay?\nPeople come out of the woodwork to make their agendas known. Be on\nyour guard.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know Daddy bothered to care about my safety.\u201d He never had\nbefore.\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t,\u201d Ruhn said, lips thinning, the silver hoop through the\nbottom one shifting with the movement. \u201cBut I\u2019ll make him care about it.\u201d\nShe considered the rage in his blue eyes\u2014it wasn\u2019t directed at her.\nRuhn hadn\u2019t yet fallen in line, then. Hadn\u2019t bought into his Chosen One\ngreatness. She took another sip of water. \u201cSince when does he listen to\nyou?\u201d\n\u201cBryce. Just stay out of trouble\u2014on all fronts. For whatever reason,\nthis Summit is important to him. He\u2019s been on edge about it\u2014beyond the\nwhole everyone-needing-to-behave-themselves bullcrap.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI\nhaven\u2019t seen him this riled since two years ago \u2026\u201d\nThe words trailed off as he caught himself. But she got his meaning.\nSince two years ago. Since Danika. And Connor.\nThe glass in her hands cracked.\n\u201cEasy,\u201d Ruhn murmured. \u201cEasy.\u201d\nShe couldn\u2019t stop clutching the glass, couldn\u2019t get her body to back\ndown from the primal fury that surged up, up\u2014\nThe heavy crystal glass exploded in her hands, water spraying across\nthe golden bar. The bartender whirled, but kept away. No one along the bar\ndared look for more than a breath\u2014not at the Crown Prince of the Valbaran\nFae.\nRuhn gripped Bryce\u2019s face with a hand. \u201cTake a fucking breath.\u201d\nThat horrible, useless Fae side of her obeyed the dominance in his\ncommand, her body falling back on instincts that had been bred into her,\ndespite her best attempts to ignore them.\nBryce sucked in a breath, then another. Gasping, shuddering sounds.\nBut with each breath, the blinding wrath receded. Eddied away.\nRuhn held her gaze until she stopped snarling, until she could see\nclearly. Then he slowly released her face\u2014and took a deep breath of his\nown. \u201cFuck, Bryce.\u201d\nShe stood on wobbling legs and adjusted the strap of her purse over\nher shoulder, making sure Maximus\u2019s outrageous check was still inside.\n\u201cMessage received. I\u2019ll lie low and act my classiest until the Summit.\u201d\nRuhn scowled and slid off the stool with familiar Fae grace. \u201cLet me\nwalk you home.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t need you to.\u201d Besides, no one went to her apartment. Which\nwasn\u2019t technically even her apartment, but that was beside the point. Only\nher mom and Randall, and occasionally Juniper if she ever left the dance\nstudio, but no one else was allowed inside. It was her sanctuary, and she\ndidn\u2019t want Fae scents anywhere near it.\nBut Ruhn ignored her refusal and scanned the bar. \u201cWhere\u2019s your\ncoat?\u201d\nShe clenched her jaw. \u201cI didn\u2019t bring one.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s barely spring.\u201d\nShe stomped past him, wishing she\u2019d worn boots instead of stilettos.\n\u201cThen it\u2019s a good thing I have my alcohol sweater on, isn\u2019t it?\u201d A lie. She\nhadn\u2019t touched a drink in nearly two years.\nRuhn didn\u2019t know that, though. Nor did anyone else.\nHe trailed her. \u201cYou\u2019re hilarious. Glad all those tuition dollars went to\nsomething.\u201d\nShe strode down the stairs. \u201cAt least I went to college and didn\u2019t sit at\nhome on a pile of Daddy\u2019s cash, playing video games with my dickbag\nfriends.\u201d\nRuhn growled, but Bryce was already halfway down the staircase to\nthe dance floor. Moments later, she was elbowing her way through the\ncrowds between the pillars, then breezing down the few steps into the glass-\nenclosed courtyard\u2014still flanked on two sides by the temple\u2019s original\nstone walls\u2014and toward the enormous iron doors. She didn\u2019t wait to see if\nRuhn still trailed before she slipped out, waving at the half-wolf, half-\ndaemonaki bouncers, who returned the gesture.\nThey were good guys\u2014years ago, on rougher nights, they had always\nmade sure Bryce got into a taxi. And that the driver knew exactly what\nwould happen if she didn\u2019t get home in one piece.\nShe made it a block before she sensed Ruhn catching up, a storm of\ntemper behind her. Not close enough for someone to know they were\ntogether, but near enough for her senses to be full of his scent, his\nannoyance.\nAt least it kept any would-be predators from approaching her.\nWhen Bryce reached the glass-and-marble lobby of her building,\nMarrin, the ursine shifter behind the front desk, buzzed her through the\ndouble doors with a friendly wave. Pausing with a hand on the glass doors,\nshe glanced over a shoulder to where Ruhn leaned against a black-painted\nlamppost. He lifted a hand in farewell\u2014a mockery of one.\nShe flipped him off and walked into her building. A quick hello to\nMarrin, an elevator ride up to the penthouse, five levels above, and the\nsmall cream-colored hallway appeared. She sighed, heels sinking into the\nplush cobalt runner that flowed between her apartment and the one across\nthe hall, and opened her purse. She found her keys by the glow of the\nfirstlight orb in the bowl atop the blackwood table against the wall, its\nradiance gilding the white orchid drooping over it.\nBryce unlocked her door, first by key, then by the finger pad beside the\nknob. The heavy locks and spells hissed as they faded away, and she\nstepped into her dark apartment. The scent of lilac oil from her diffuser\ncaressed her as Syrinx yowled his greeting and demanded to be\nimmediately released from his crate. But Bryce leaned back against the\ndoor.\nShe hated knowing that Ruhn still lurked on the street below, the\nCrown Fucking Prince of Possessive and Aggressive Alphaholes, staring at\nthe massive floor-to-ceiling wall of windows across the great room before\nher, waiting for the lights to come on.\nHis banging on the door in three minutes would be inevitable if she\nrefused to turn on the lights. Marrin wouldn\u2019t be stupid enough to stop him.\nNot Ruhn Danaan. There had never been a door shut for him, not once in\nhis entire life.\nBut she wasn\u2019t in the mood for that battle. Not tonight.\nBryce flicked on the panel of lights beside the door, illuminating the\npale wood floors, the white plush furniture, the matching white walls. All of\nit as pristine as the day she\u2019d moved in, almost two years ago\u2014all of it far\nabove her pay grade.\nAll of it paid for by Danika. By that stupid fucking will.\nSyrinx grumbled, his cage rattling. Another possessive and aggressive\nalphahole. But a small, fuzzy one, at least.\nWith a sigh, Bryce kicked off her heels, unhooked her bra at last, and\nwent to let the little beast out of his cage."}, "9": {"Name": "PART II THE TRENCH-Chapter 9", "Page Content": " \n\u201cPlease.\u201d\nThe male\u2019s whimper was barely discernible with the blood filling his\nmouth, his nostrils. But he still tried again. \u201cPlease.\u201d\nHunt Athalar\u2019s sword dripped blood onto the soaked carpet of the\ndingy apartment in the Meadows. Splatters of it coated the visor of his\nhelmet, speckling his line of vision as he surveyed the lone male standing.\nKneeling, technically.\nThe male\u2019s friends littered the living room floor, one of them still\nspurting blood from what was now his stump of a neck. His severed head\nlay on the sagging sofa, gaping face rolled into the age-flattened cushions.\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you everything,\u201d the male pleaded, sobbing as he pressed his\nhand against the gash on his shoulder. \u201cThey didn\u2019t tell you all of it, but I\ncan.\u201d\nThe male\u2019s terror filled the room, overpowering the scent of blood, its\nreek as bad as stale piss in an alley.\nHunt\u2019s gloved hand tightened on his blade. The male noted it and\nbegan shaking, a stain paler than blood leaking across his pants. \u201cI\u2019ll tell\nyou more,\u201d the man tried again.\nHunt braced his feet, rooting his strength into the floor, and slashed his\nblade.\nThe male\u2019s innards spilled onto the carpet with a wet slap. Still the\nmale kept screaming.\nSo Hunt kept working.\nHunt made it to the Comitium barracks without anyone seeing him.\nAt this hour, the city at least appeared asleep. The five buildings that\nmade up the Comitium\u2019s complex did, too. But the cameras throughout the\n33rd Legion\u2019s barracks\u2014the second of the Comitium\u2019s spire-capped towers\n\u2014saw everything. Heard everything.\nThe white-tiled halls were dim, no hint of the hustle that would fill\nthem come dawn.\nThe helmet\u2019s visor cast everything into stark relief, its audio receptors\npicking up sounds from behind the shut bedroom doors lining either side of\nhallway: low-level sentries playing some video game, doing their best to\nkeep their voices down as they cursed at each other; a female sentry talking\non the phone; two angels fucking each other\u2019s brains out; and several\nsnorers.\nHunt passed his own door, instead aiming for the shared bathroom in\nthe center of the long hallway, accessible only through the common room.\nAny hope for an unnoticed return vanished at the sight of the golden light\nleaking from beneath the shut door and the sound of voices beyond it.\nToo tired, too filthy, Hunt didn\u2019t bother to say hello as he entered the\ncommon room, prowling past the scattering of couches and chairs toward\nthe bathroom.\nNaomi was sprawled on the worn green couch before the TV, her black\nwings spread. Viktoria lounged in the armchair next to her, watching the\nday\u2019s sports highlights, and on the other end of the couch sat Justinian, still\nin his black legionary armor.\nTheir conversation stalled as Hunt entered.\n\u201cHey,\u201d Naomi said, her inky braid draping over her shoulder. She wore\nher usual black\u2014the triarii\u2019s usual black\u2014though there was no trace of her\nwicked weapons or their holsters.\nViktoria seemed content to let Hunt pass without greeting. It was why\nhe liked the wraith more than nearly anyone else in Micah Domitus\u2019s inner\ncircle of warriors, had liked her since those early days in the 18th, when\nshe\u2019d been one of the few non-angel Vanir to join their cause. Vik never\npushed when Hunt didn\u2019t want to be bothered. But Justinian\u2014\nThe angel sniffed, scenting the blood on Hunt\u2019s clothes, his weapons.\nHow many different people it belonged to. Justinian blew out a whistle.\n\u201cYou are one sick fuck, you know that?\u201d\nHunt continued toward the bathroom door. His lightning didn\u2019t so\nmuch as hiss inside him.\nJustinian went on, \u201cA gun would have been a Hel of a lot cleaner.\u201d\n\u201cMicah didn\u2019t want a gun for this,\u201d Hunt said, his voice hollow even to\nhis ears. It had been that way for centuries now; but tonight, these kills he\u2019d\nmade, what they\u2019d done to earn the wrath of the Archangel \u2026 \u201cThey didn\u2019t\ndeserve a gun,\u201d he amended. Or the swift bolt of his lightning.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to know,\u201d Naomi grumbled, punching up the volume of\nthe TV. She pointed with the remote at Justinian, the youngest in the triarii.\n\u201cAnd neither do you, so shut it.\u201d\nNo, they really didn\u2019t want to know.\nNaomi\u2014the only one of the triarii who was not Fallen\u2014said to Hunt,\n\u201cIsaiah told me that Micah wants you two playing investigators tomorrow\nfor some shit in the Old Square. Isaiah will call you after breakfast with the\ndetails.\u201d\nThe words barely registered. Isaiah. Tomorrow. Old Square.\nJustinian snorted. \u201cGood luck, man.\u201d He swigged from his beer. \u201cI hate\nthe Old Square\u2014it\u2019s all university brats and tourist creeps.\u201d Naomi and\nViktoria grunted their agreement.\nHunt didn\u2019t ask why they were up, or where Isaiah was, given that he\ncouldn\u2019t deliver the message. The angel was likely with whatever handsome\nmale he was currently dating.\nAs Commander of the 33rd, acquired by Micah to shore up Crescent\nCity\u2019s defenses, Isaiah had enjoyed every second here since he\u2019d arrived\nmore than a decade ago. In four years, Hunt hadn\u2019t seen the city\u2019s appeal\nbeyond it being a cleaner, more organized version of any Pangeran\nmetropolis, with streets in clean lines rather than meandering curves that\noften doubled back on themselves, as if in no hurry to get anywhere.\nBut at least it wasn\u2019t Ravilis. And at least it was Micah ruling over it,\nnot Sandriel.\nSandriel\u2014the Archangel and Governor of the northwestern quadrant\nof Pangera, and Hunt\u2019s former owner before Micah had traded with her,\ndesiring to have Hunt clear Crescent City of any enemies. Sandriel\u2014his\ndead lover\u2019s twin sister.\nThe formal papers declared that Hunt\u2019s duties would be to track down\nand dispatch any loose demons. But considering that those sorts of disasters\nhappened only once or twice a year, it was glaringly obvious why he\u2019d\nreally been brought over. He\u2019d done most of the assassinating for Sandriel,\nthe Archangel who bore the same face as his beloved, for the fifty-three\nyears she\u2019d possessed him.\nA rare occurrence, for both siblings to bear an Archangel\u2019s title and\npower. A good omen, people had believed. Until Shahar\u2014until Hunt,\nleading her forces\u2014had rebelled against everything the angels stood for.\nAnd betrayed her sister in the process.\nSandriel had been the third of his owners after the defeat at Mount\nHermon, and had been arrogant enough to believe that despite the two\nArchangels before her who had failed to do so, she might be the one to\nbreak him. First in her horror show of a dungeon. Then in her blood-soaked\narena in the heart of Ravilis, pitting him against warriors who never stood a\nchance. Then by commanding him to do what he did best: slipping into a\nroom and ending lives. One after another after another, year after year,\ndecade after decade.\nSandriel certainly had motivation to break him. During that too-short\nbattle at Hermon, it was her forces that Hunt had decimated, his lightning\nthat turned soldier after soldier into charred husks before they could draw\ntheir swords. Sandriel had been Shahar\u2019s prime target, and Hunt had been\nordered to take her out. By whatever means necessary.\nAnd Shahar had good reason to go after her sister. Their parents had\nboth been Archangels, whose titles had passed to their daughters after an\nassassin had somehow managed to rip them to shreds.\nHe\u2019d never forget Shahar\u2019s theory: that Sandriel had killed their\nparents and framed the assassin. That she\u2019d done it for herself and her sister,\nso they might rule without interference. There had never been proof to pin it\non Sandriel, but Shahar believed it to her dying day.\nShahar, the Daystar, had rebelled against her fellow Archangels and the\nAsteri because of it. She\u2019d wanted a world free of rigid hierarchies, yes\u2014\nwould have brought their rebellion right to the crystal palace of the Asteri if\nit had been successful. But she\u2019d also wanted to make her sister pay. So\nHunt had been unleashed.\nFools. They had all been fools.\nIt made no difference if he\u2019d admitted his folly. Sandriel believed he\u2019d\nlured her twin into the rebellion, that he had turned Shahar against her. That\nsomehow, when sister had drawn blade against sister, so nearly identical in\nface and build and fighting technique that it was like watching someone\nbattle their reflection, it was his fucking fault that it had ended with one of\nthem dead.\nAt least Micah had offered him the chance to redeem himself. To prove\nhis utter loyalty and submission to the Archangels, to the empire, and then\none day get the halo removed. Decades from now, possibly centuries, but\nconsidering that the oldest angels lived to be nearly eight hundred \u2026 maybe\nhe\u2019d earn back his freedom in time to be old. He could potentially die free.\nMicah had offered Hunt the bargain from his first day in Crescent City\nfour years ago: a kill for every life he\u2019d taken that bloody day on Mount\nHermon. Every angel he\u2019d slaughtered during that doomed battle, he was to\npay back. In the form of more death. A death for a death, Micah had said.\nWhen you\u2019ve fulfilled the debt, Athalar, we\u2019ll discuss removing that tattoo\non your brow.\nHunt had never known the tally\u2014how many he\u2019d killed that day. But\nMicah, who\u2019d been on that battlefield, who\u2019d watched while Shahar fell at\nher twin sister\u2019s hand, had the list. They\u2019d had to pay out commissions for\nall the legionaries. Hunt had been about to ask how they\u2019d been able to\ndetermine which killing blows had been made by his blade and not\nsomeone else\u2019s, when he\u2019d seen the number.\nTwo thousand two hundred and seventeen.\nIt was impossible for him to have personally killed that many in one\nbattle. Yes, his lightning had been unleashed; yes, he\u2019d blasted apart entire\nunits, but that many?\nHe\u2019d gaped. You were Shahar\u2019s general, Micah said. You commanded\nthe 18th. So you will atone, Athalar, not only for the lives you took, but\nthose your traitorous legion took as well. At Hunt\u2019s silence, Micah had\nadded, This is not some impossible task. Some of my missions will count for\nmore than one life. Behave, obey, and you will be able to reach this number.\nFor four years now, he had behaved. He had obeyed. And tonight had\nput him at a grand total of eighty-fucking-two.\nIt was the best he could hope for. All he worked for. No other\nArchangel had ever offered him the chance. It was why he\u2019d done\neverything Micah had ordered him to do tonight. Why every thought felt\ndistant, his body pulled from him, his head full of a dull roaring.\nMicah was an Archangel. A Governor appointed by the Asteri. He was\na king among angels, and law unto himself, especially in Valbara\u2014so far\nfrom the seven hills of the Eternal City. If he deemed someone a threat or in\nneed of justice, then there would be no investigation, no trial.\nJust his command. Usually to Hunt.\nIt would arrive in the form of a file in his barracks mailbox, the\nimperial crest on its front. No mention of his name. Just SPQM, and the\nseven stars surrounding the letters.\nThe file contained all he needed: names, dates, crimes, and a timeline\nfor Hunt to do what he did best. Plus any requests from Micah regarding the\nmethod employed.\nTonight it had been simple enough\u2014no guns. Hunt understood the\nunwritten words: make them suffer. So he had.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a beer with your name on it when you come out,\u201d Viktoria\nsaid, her eyes meeting Hunt\u2019s even with the helmet on. Nothing but a\ncasual, cool invitation.\nHunt continued into the bathroom, the firstlights fluttering to life as he\nshouldered his way through the door and approached one of the shower\nstalls. He cranked the water to full heat before stalking back to the row of\npedestal sinks.\nIn the mirror above one, the being who stared back was as bad as a\nReaper. Worse.\nBlood splattered the helmet, right over the painted silver skull\u2019s face. It\ngleamed faintly on the intricate leather scales of his battle-suit, on his black\ngloves, on the twin swords peeking above his shoulders. Flecks of it even\nstained his gray wings.\nHunt peeled off the helmet and braced his hands on the sink.\nIn the harsh bathroom firstlights, his light brown skin was pallid under\nthe black band of thorns across his brow. The tattoo, he\u2019d learned to live\nwith. But he shrank from the look in his dark eyes. Glazed. Empty. Like\nstaring into Hel.\nOrion, his mother had named him. Hunter. He doubted she would have\ndone so, would have so lovingly called him Hunt instead, if she\u2019d known\nwhat he\u2019d become.\nHunt glanced to where his gloves had left red stains on the porcelain\nsink.\nTugging off the gloves with brutal efficiency, Hunt prowled to the\nshower stall, where the water had reached near-scalding temperatures. He\nremoved his weapons, then his battle-suit, leaving more streaks of blood on\nthe tiles.\nHunt stepped under the spray, and submitted himself to its relentless\nburning."}, "10": {"Name": "PART II THE TRENCH-Chapter 10", "Page Content": " 0 \nIt was barely ten in the morning, and Tuesday was already fucked.\nKeeping a smile pasted on her face, Bryce lingered by her ironwood\ndesk in the showroom of the gallery while a Fae couple browsed.\nThe elegant plucking of violins trickled through the hidden speakers in\nthe two-level, wood-paneled space, the opening movement of a symphony\nthat she\u2019d switched on as soon as the intercom had buzzed. Given the\ncouple\u2019s attire\u2014a pleated tan skirt and white silk blouse for the female, a\ngray suit for the male\u2014she\u2019d doubted they\u2019d appreciate the thumping bass\nof her morning workout mix.\nBut they\u2019d been browsing the art for ten minutes now, which was\nenough time for her to politely inquire, \u201cAre you here for anything in\nparticular, or just to browse?\u201d\nThe blond Fae male, older-looking for one of his kind, waved a\ndismissive hand, leading his companion toward the nearest display: a partial\nmarble relief from the ruins of Morrah, salvaged from a wrecked temple.\nThe piece was about the size of a coffee table, with a rearing hippocamp\nfilling most of it. The half-horse, half-fish creatures had once dwelled in the\ncerulean waters of the Rhagan Sea in Pangera, until ancient wars had\ndestroyed them.\n\u201cBrowsing,\u201d the male replied coldly, his hand coming to rest on his\ncompanion\u2019s slender back as they studied the waves carved in strikingly\nprecise detail.\nBryce summoned another smile. \u201cTake your time. I\u2019m at your\ndisposal.\u201d\nThe female nodded her thanks, but the male sneered his dismissal. His\ncompanion frowned deeply at him.\nThe silence in the small gallery turned palpable.\nBryce had gleaned from the moment they\u2019d walked through the door\nthat the male was here to impress the female, either by buying something\noutrageously expensive or pretending he could. Perhaps this was an\narranged pairing, testing out the waters before committing to anything\nfurther.\nHad Bryce been full-blooded Fae, had her father claimed her as his\noffspring, she might have been subjected to such things. Ruhn, especially\nwith his Starborn status, would one day have to submit to an arranged\nmarriage, when a young female deemed suitable to continue the precious\nroyal bloodline came along.\nRuhn might sire a few children before then, but they wouldn\u2019t be\nacknowledged as royalty unless their father chose that path. Unless they\nwere worthy of it.\nThe Fae couple passed the mosaic from the courtyard of the once-great\npalace in Altium, then studied the intricate jade puzzle box that had\nbelonged to a princess in a forgotten northern land.\nJesiba did most of the art acquisitions, which was why she was away\nso often, but Bryce herself had tracked down and purchased a good number\nof the pieces. And then resold them at a steep profit.\nThe couple had reached a set of fertility statues from Setmek when the\nfront door buzzed.\nBryce glanced toward the clock on her desk. The afternoon client\nappointment wasn\u2019t for another three hours. To have multiple browsers in\nthe gallery was an oddity given the notoriously steep price tags of the art in\nhere, but\u2014maybe she\u2019d get lucky and sell something today.\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Bryce murmured, ducking around the massive desk and\npulling up the outside camera feed on the computer. She\u2019d barely clicked\nthe icon when the buzzer rang again.\nBryce beheld who was standing on the sidewalk and froze.\nTuesday was indeed fucked.\nNo windows lined the sandstone facade of the slender two-story building a\nblock off the Istros River. Only a bronze plaque to the right of the heavy\niron door revealed to Hunt Athalar that it was a business of any sort.\nGriffin Antiquities had been etched there in archaic, bold lettering, the\nwords adorned with a set of glaring owl eyes beneath them, as if daring any\nshoppers to enter. An intercom with a matching bronze button lay beneath.\nIsaiah, in his usual suit and tie, had been staring at the buzzer for long\nenough that Hunt finally drawled, \u201cThere aren\u2019t any enchantments on it,\nyou know.\u201d Despite the identity of its owner.\nIsaiah shot him a look, straightening his tie. \u201cI should have had a\nsecond cup of coffee,\u201d he muttered before stabbing a finger onto the metal\nbutton. A faint buzzing sounded through the door.\nNo one answered.\nHunt scanned the building exterior for a hidden camera. Not a gleam\nor hint. The nearest one, in fact, was mounted on the chrome door of the\nbomb shelter halfway down the block.\nHunt scanned the sandstone facade again. There was no way Jesiba\nRoga wouldn\u2019t have cameras covering every inch, both outside and within.\nHunt unleashed a crackle of his power, small tongues of lightning\ntasting for energy fields.\nNearly invisible in the sunny morning, the lightning bounced off a\nskintight enchantment coating the stone, the mortar, the door. A cold, clever\nspell that seemed to laugh softly at any attempt to enter.\nHunt murmured, \u201cRoga isn\u2019t screwing around, is she?\u201d\nIsaiah pushed the buzzer again, harder than necessary. They had their\norders\u2014ones that were pressing enough that even Isaiah, regardless of the\nlack of coffee, was on a short fuse.\nThough it could also have been due to the fact that Isaiah had been out\nuntil four in the morning. Hunt hadn\u2019t asked about it, though. Had only\nheard Naomi and Justinian gossiping in the common room, wondering if\nthis new boyfriend meant Isaiah was finally moving on.\nHunt hadn\u2019t bothered to tell them there was no fucking way. Not when\nIsaiah obeyed Micah only because of the generous weekly salary that Micah\ngave them all, when the law declared that slaves weren\u2019t owed a paycheck.\nThe money Isaiah amassed would buy someone else\u2019s freedom. Just as the\nshit Hunt did for Micah went toward earning his own.\nIsaiah rang the buzzer a third time. \u201cMaybe she\u2019s not in.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s here,\u201d Hunt said. The scent of her still lingered on the sidewalk,\nlilac and nutmeg and something he couldn\u2019t quite place\u2014like the gleam of\nthe first stars at nightfall.\nAnd indeed, a moment later, a silky female voice that definitely did not\nbelong to the gallery\u2019s owner crackled through the intercom. \u201cI didn\u2019t order\na pizza.\u201d\nDespite himself, despite the mental clock ticking away, Hunt choked\non a laugh.\nIsaiah rustled his white wings, plastering on a charming smile, and said\ninto the intercom, \u201cWe\u2019re from the 33rd Legion. We\u2019re here to see Bryce\nQuinlan.\u201d\nThe voice sharpened. \u201cI\u2019m with clients. Come back later.\u201d\nHunt was pretty sure that \u201ccome back later\u201d meant \u201cgo fuck\nyourselves.\u201d\nIsaiah\u2019s charming smile strained. \u201cThis is a matter of some urgency,\nMiss Quinlan.\u201d\nA low hum. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but you\u2019ll have to make an appointment. How\nabout \u2026 three weeks? I\u2019ve got the twenty-eighth of April free. I\u2019ll pencil\nyou in for noon.\u201d\nWell, she had balls, Hunt would give her that much.\nIsaiah widened his stance. Typical legion fighting position, beaten into\nthem from their earliest days as grunts. \u201cWe need to talk right now, I\u2019m\nafraid.\u201d\nNo answer came. Like she\u2019d just walked away from the intercom.\nHunt\u2019s snarl sent the poor faun walking behind them bolting down the\nstreet, his delicate hooves clopping on the cobblestones. \u201cShe\u2019s a spoiled\nparty girl. What did you expect?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s not stupid, Hunt,\u201d Isaiah countered.\n\u201cEverything I\u2019ve seen and heard suggests otherwise.\u201d What he\u2019d seen\nwhen he skimmed her file two years ago, combined with what he\u2019d read\nthis morning and the pictures he\u2019d gone through, all painted a portrait that\ntold him precisely how this meeting would go. Too bad for her it was about\nto get a Hel of a lot more serious.\nHunt jerked his chin toward the door. \u201cLet\u2019s see if a client\u2019s even in\nthere.\u201d He stalked back across the street, where he leaned against a parked\nblue car. Some drunken reveler had used its hood as a canvas to spray-paint\nan unnecessarily detailed, massive cock\u2014with wings. A mockery of the\n33rd\u2019s logo of a winged sword, he realized. Or merely the logo stripped\ndown to its true meaning.\nIsaiah noted it as well and chuckled, following Hunt\u2019s lead and leaning\nagainst the car.\nA minute passed. Hunt didn\u2019t move an inch. Didn\u2019t take his gaze away\nfrom the iron door. He had better things to do with this day than play games\nwith a brat, but orders were orders. After five minutes, a sleek black sedan\nrolled up and the iron door opened.\nThe Fae driver of the car, which was worth more than most human\nfamilies saw in a lifetime, got out. He was around the other side of the\nvehicle in a heartbeat, opening the back passenger door. Two Fae paraded\nout of the gallery, a male and a female. The pretty female\u2019s every breath\nradiated the easy confidence gained from a lifetime of wealth and privilege.\nAround her slim neck lay a strand of diamonds, each as large as Hunt\u2019s\nfingernail. Worth as much as the car\u2014more. The male climbed into the\nsedan, face tight as he slammed the door before his driver could do it for\nhim. The well-heeled female just rushed down the street, phone already to\nher ear, grousing to whoever was on the line about No more blind dates, for\nUrd\u2019s sake.\nHunt\u2019s attention returned to the gallery door, where a curvy, red-haired\nwoman stood.\nOnly when the car rounded the corner did Bryce slide her eyes toward\nthem.\nShe angled her head, her silken sheet of hair sliding over the shoulder\nof her white skintight dress, and smiled brightly. Waved. The delicate gold\namulet around her tan neck glinted.\nHunt pushed off the parked car and stalked toward her, his gray wings\nflaring wide.\nA flick of Bryce\u2019s amber eyes took in Hunt from his tattoo to his ass-\nkicking boot tips. Her smile grew. \u201cSee you in three weeks,\u201d she said\ncheerfully, and slammed the door shut.\nHunt cleared the street in a matter of steps. A car screeched to a stop,\nbut the driver wasn\u2019t stupid enough to blast the horn. Not when lightning\nwreathed Hunt\u2019s fist as he pounded it into the intercom button. \u201cDon\u2019t\nwaste my fucking time, Quinlan.\u201d\nIsaiah let the near-frantic driver pass before coming up behind Hunt,\nhis brown eyes narrowing. But Bryce replied sweetly, \u201cMy boss doesn\u2019t like\nlegionaries in her place. Sorry.\u201d\nHunt slammed his fist into the iron door. That same blow had smashed\ncars, shattered walls, and splintered bones. And that was without the aid of\nthe storm in his veins. The iron didn\u2019t so much as shudder; his lightning\nskittered off it.\nTo Hel with threats, then. He\u2019d go for the jugular, as deep and sure as\nany of his physical kills. So Hunt said into the intercom, \u201cWe\u2019re here about\na murder.\u201d\nIsaiah winced, scanning the street and skies for anyone who might\nhave heard.\nHunt crossed his arms as the silence spread.\nThen the iron door hissed and clicked, and inched open.\nBull\u2019s-fucking-eye.\nIt took Hunt a heartbeat to adjust from the sunlight to the dimmer\ninterior, and he used that first step into the gallery to note every angle and\nexit and detail.\nPlush pine-green carpets went wall to wood-paneled wall in the two-\nstory showroom. Alcoves with soft-lit art displays dotted the edges of the\nroom: chunks of ancient frescoes, paintings, and statues of Vanir so strange\nand rare even Hunt didn\u2019t know their names.\nBryce Quinlan leaned against the large ironwood desk in the center of\nthe space, her snow-white dress clinging to every generous curve and dip.\nHunt smiled slowly, showing all his teeth.\nHe waited for it: the realization of who he was. Waited for her to\nshrink back, to fumble for the panic button or gun or whatever the fuck she\nthought might save her from the likes of him.\nBut maybe she was stupid, after all, because her answering smile was\nsaccharine in the extreme. Her red-tinted nails idly tapped on the pristine\nwood surface. \u201cYou have fifteen minutes.\u201d\nHunt didn\u2019t tell her that this meeting would likely take a good deal\nlonger than that.\nIsaiah turned to shut the door, but Hunt knew it was already locked.\nJust as he knew, thanks to legion intel gathered over the years, that the\nsmall wood door behind the desk led upstairs to Jesiba Roga\u2019s office\u2014\nwhere a floor-to-ceiling internal window overlooked the showroom they\nstood in\u2014and the simple iron door to their right led down into another full\nlevel, stocked with things that legionaries weren\u2019t supposed to find. The\nenchantments on those two doors were probably even more intense than\nthose outside.\nIsaiah loosed one of his long-suffering sighs. \u201cA murder occurred on\nthe outskirts of the Meat Market last night. We believe you knew the\nvictim.\u201d\nHunt marked every reaction that flitted across her face as she\nmaintained her perch on the edge of the desk: the slight widening of her\neyes, the pause in those tapping nails, the sole blink that suggested she had\na short list of possible victims and none of the options were good.\n\u201cWho?\u201d was all she said, her voice steady. Wisps of smoke from the\nconical diffuser beside the computer drifted past her, carrying the bright,\nclean scent of peppermint. Of course she was one of those aromatherapy\nzealots, conned into handing over her marks for the promise of feeling\nhappier, or being better in bed, or growing another half a brain to match the\nhalf she already had.\n\u201cMaximus Tertian,\u201d Isaiah told her. \u201cWe have reports that you had a\nmeeting with him in the VIP mezzanine of the White Raven two hours\nbefore his death.\u201d\nHunt could have sworn Bryce\u2019s shoulders sagged slightly. She said,\n\u201cMaximus Tertian is dead.\u201d They nodded. She angled her head. \u201cWho did\nit?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to figure out,\u201d Isaiah said neutrally.\nHunt had heard of Tertian\u2014a creep of a vamp who couldn\u2019t take no for\nan answer, and whose rich, sadistic father had taught him well. And\nshielded him from any fallout from his hideous behavior. If Hunt was being\nhonest, Midgard was better off without him. Except for the headache they\u2019d\nnow have to endure when Tertian\u2019s father got word that his favored son had\nbeen killed \u2026 Today\u2019s meeting would be just the start.\nIsaiah went on, \u201cYou might have been one of the last people to see him\nalive. Can you walk us through your encounter with him? No detail is too\nsmall.\u201d\nBryce glanced between them. \u201cIs this your way of feeling out whether\nI killed him?\u201d\nHunt smiled slightly. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem too cut up that Tertian\u2019s dead.\u201d\nThose amber eyes slid to him, annoyance lighting them.\nHe\u2019d admit it: males would do a lot of fucked-up things for someone\nwho looked like that.\nHe\u2019d done precisely those sort of things for Shahar once. Now he bore\nthe halo tattooed across his brow and the slave tattoo on his wrist because\nof it. His chest tightened.\nBryce said, \u201cI\u2019m sure someone\u2019s already said that Maximus and I\nparted on unfriendly terms. We met to finish up a deal for the gallery, and\nwhen it was done, he thought he was entitled to some \u2026 personal time with\nme.\u201d\nHunt understood her perfectly. It lined up with everything he\u2019d heard\nregarding Tertian and his father. It also offered a good amount of motive.\nBryce went on, \u201cI don\u2019t know where he went after the Raven. If he was\nkilled on the outskirts of the Meat Market, I\u2019d assume he was heading there\nto purchase what he wanted to take from me.\u201d Cold, sharp words.\nIsaiah\u2019s expression grew stony. \u201cWas his behavior last night different\nfrom how he acted during previous meetings?\u201d\n\u201cWe only interacted over emails and the phone, but I\u2019d say no. Last\nnight was our first face-to-face, and he acted exactly as his past behavior\nwould indicate.\u201d\nHunt asked, \u201cWhy not meet here? Why the Raven?\u201d\n\u201cHe got off on the thrill of acting like our deal was secretive. He\nclaimed he didn\u2019t trust that my boss wasn\u2019t recording the meeting, but he\nreally just wanted people to notice him\u2014to see him doing deals. I had to\nslide him the paperwork in a bill folio, and he swapped it with one of his\nown, that sort of thing.\u201d She met Hunt\u2019s stare. \u201cHow did he die?\u201d\nThe question was blunt, and she didn\u2019t smile or blink. A girl used to\nbeing answered, obeyed, heeded. Her parents weren\u2019t wealthy\u2014or so her\nfile said\u2014yet her apartment fifteen blocks away suggested outrageous\nwealth. Either from this job or some shady shit that had escaped even the\nlegion\u2019s watchful eyes.\nIsaiah sighed. \u201cThose details are classified.\u201d\nShe shook her head. \u201cI can\u2019t help you. Tertian and I did the deal, he got\nhandsy, and he left.\u201d\nEvery bit of the camera footage and eyewitness reports from the Raven\nconfirmed that. But that wasn\u2019t why they were here. What they\u2019d been sent\nover to do.\nIsaiah said, \u201cAnd when did Prince Ruhn Danaan show up?\u201d\n\u201cIf you know everything, why bother asking me?\u201d She didn\u2019t wait for\nthem to answer before she said, \u201cYou know, you two never told me your\nnames.\u201d\nHunt couldn\u2019t read her expression, her relaxed body language. They\nhadn\u2019t initiated contact since that night in the legion\u2019s holding center\u2014and\nneither of them had introduced themselves then. Had she even registered\ntheir faces in that drug-induced haze?\nIsaiah adjusted his pristine white wings. \u201cI\u2019m Isaiah Tiberian,\nCommander of the 33rd Imperial Legion. This is Hunt Athalar, my\u2014\u201d\nIsaiah tripped up, as if realizing that it had been a damn long time\nsince they\u2019d had to introduce themselves with any sort of rank attached. So\nHunt did Isaiah a favor and finished with, \u201cHis Second.\u201d\nIf Isaiah was surprised to hear it, that calm, pretty-boy face didn\u2019t let\non. Isaiah was, technically, his superior in the triarii and in the 33rd as a\nwhole, even if the shit Hunt did for Micah made him directly answerable to\nthe Governor.\nIsaiah had never pulled rank, though. As if he remembered those days\nbefore the Fall, and who\u2019d been in charge then.\nAs if it fucking mattered now.\nNo, all that mattered about that shit was that Isaiah had killed at least\nthree dozen Imperial Legionaries that day on Mount Hermon. And Hunt\nnow bore the burden of paying back each one of those lives to the Republic.\nTo fulfill Micah\u2019s bargain.\nBryce\u2019s eyes flicked to their brows\u2014the tattoos there. Hunt braced for\nthe sneering remark, for any of the bullshit comments people still liked to\nmake about the Fallen Legion and their failed rebellion. But she only said,\n\u201cSo, what\u2014you two investigate crimes on the side? I thought that was\nAuxiliary territory. Don\u2019t you have better things to do in the 33rd than play\nbuddy cop?\u201d\nIsaiah, apparently not amused that there was one person in this city\nwho didn\u2019t fall at his feet, said a tad stiffly, \u201cDo you have people who can\nverify your whereabouts after you left the White Raven?\u201d\nBryce held Isaiah\u2019s gaze. Then flicked her eyes to Hunt. And he still\ncouldn\u2019t read her mask of boredom as she pushed off the desk and took a\nfew deliberate steps toward them before crossing her arms.\n\u201cJust my doorman \u2026 and Ruhn Danaan, but you already knew that.\u201d\nHow anyone could walk in heels that high was beyond him. How\nanyone could breathe in a dress that tight was also a mystery. It was long\nenough that it covered the area on her thigh where the scar from that night\ntwo years ago would be\u2014that is, if she hadn\u2019t paid some medwitch to erase\nit. For someone who clearly took pains to dress nicely, he had little doubt\nshe\u2019d gotten it removed immediately.\nParty girls didn\u2019t like scars messing with how they looked in a\nswimsuit.\nIsaiah\u2019s white wings shifted. \u201cWould you call Ruhn Danaan a friend?\u201d\nBryce shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019s a distant cousin.\u201d\nBut apparently invested enough to have charged into the interrogation\nroom two years ago. And shown up at the VIP bar last night. If he was that\nprotective of Quinlan, that might be one Hel of a motive, too. Even if Ruhn\nand his father would make the interrogation a nightmare.\nBryce smiled sharply, as if she remembered that fact, too. \u201cHave fun\ntalking to him.\u201d\nHunt clenched his jaw, but she strode for the front door, hips swishing\nlike she knew precisely how spectacular her ass was.\n\u201cJust a moment, Miss Quinlan,\u201d Isaiah said. The commander\u2019s voice\nwas calm, but take-no-shit.\nHunt hid his smile. Seeing Isaiah angry was always a good show. So\nlong as you weren\u2019t on the receiving end.\nQuinlan hadn\u2019t realized that yet as she glanced over a shoulder. \u201cYes?\u201d\nHunt eyed her as Isaiah at last voiced their true reason for this little\nvisit. \u201cWe weren\u2019t just sent here to ask you about your whereabouts.\u201d\nShe gestured to the gallery. \u201cYou want to buy something pretty for the\nGovernor?\u201d\nHunt\u2019s mouth twitched upward. \u201cFunny you should mention him. He\u2019s\non his way here right now.\u201d\nA slow blink. Again, no sign or scent of fear. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cMicah just told us to get information from you about last night, and\nthen make sure you were available and have you get your boss on the line.\u201d\nGiven how infrequently Hunt was asked to help out on investigations, he\u2019d\nbeen shocked as Hel to get the order. But considering that he and Isaiah had\nbeen there that night in the alley, he supposed that made them the top\nchoices to head this sort of thing up.\n\u201cMicah is coming here.\u201d Her throat bobbed once.\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be here in ten minutes,\u201d Isaiah said. He nodded toward her\nphone. \u201cI suggest you call your boss, Miss Quinlan.\u201d\nHer breathing turned slightly shallow. \u201cWhy?\u201d\nHunt dropped the bomb at last. \u201cBecause Maximus Tertian\u2019s injuries\nwere identical to the ones inflicted upon Danika Fendyr and the Pack of\nDevils.\u201d Pulped and dismembered.\nHer eyes shuttered. \u201cBut\u2014Philip Briggs killed them. He summoned\nthat demon to kill them. And he\u2019s in prison.\u201d Her voice sharpened. \u201cHe\u2019s\nbeen in prison for two years.\u201d\nIn a place worse than prison, but that was beside the point.\n\u201cWe know,\u201d Hunt said, keeping his face devoid of any reaction.\n\u201cHe can\u2019t have killed Tertian. How could he possibly summon the\ndemon from jail?\u201d Bryce said. \u201cHe \u2026\u201d She swallowed, catching herself.\nRealizing, perhaps, why Micah was coming. Several people she\u2019d known\nhad been killed, all within hours of interacting with her. \u201cYou think Briggs\ndidn\u2019t do it. Didn\u2019t kill Danika and her pack.\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know that for sure,\u201d Isaiah cut in. \u201cBut the specific details\nof how they all died never leaked, so we have good reason to believe this\nwasn\u2019t a copycat murder.\u201d\nBryce asked flatly, \u201cHave you met with Sabine?\u201d\nHunt said, \u201cHave you?\u201d\n\u201cWe do our best to stay out of each other\u2019s way.\u201d\nIt was perhaps the only smart thing Bryce Quinlan had ever decided to\ndo. Hunt remembered Sabine\u2019s venom as she\u2019d glared through the window\nat Bryce in the observation room two years ago, and he had no doubt Sabine\nwas just waiting for enough time to pass for Quinlan\u2019s unfortunate and\nuntimely death to be considered nothing more than a fluke.\nBryce walked back to her desk, giving them a wide berth. To her\ncredit, her gait remained unhurried and solid. She picked up the phone\nwithout so much as looking at them.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll wait outside,\u201d Isaiah offered. Hunt opened his mouth to object,\nbut Isaiah shot him a warning look.\nFine. He and Quinlan could spar later.\nPhone held in a white-knuckled grip, Bryce listened to the other end ring.\nTwice. Then\u2014\n\u201cMorning, Bryce.\u201d\nBryce\u2019s heartbeat pounded in her arms, her legs, her stomach. \u201cTwo\nlegionaries are here.\u201d She swallowed. \u201cThe Commander of the 33rd and \u2026\u201d\nShe blew out a breath. \u201cThe Umbra Mortis.\u201d\nShe\u2019d recognized Isaiah Tiberian\u2014he graced the nightly news and\ngossip columns often enough that there would never be any mistaking the\n33rd\u2019s beautiful Commander.\nAnd she\u2019d recognized Hunt Athalar, too, though he was never on\ntelevision. Everyone knew who Hunt Athalar was. She\u2019d heard of him even\nwhile growing up in Nidaros, when Randall would talk about his battles in\nPangera and whispered when he mentioned Hunt. The Umbra Mortis. The\nShadow of Death.\nThen, the angel hadn\u2019t worked for Micah Domitus and his legion, but\nfor the Archangel Sandriel\u2014he\u2019d flown in her 45th Legion. Demon-\nhunting, rumor claimed his job was. And worse.\nJesiba hissed, \u201cWhy?\u201d\nBryce clutched the phone. \u201cMaximus Tertian was murdered last night.\u201d\n\u201cBurning Solas\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThe same way as Danika and the pack.\u201d\nBryce shut out every hazy image, breathing in the bright, calming\nscent of the peppermint vapors rippling from the diffuser on her desk. She\u2019d\nbought the stupid plastic cone two months after Danika had been killed,\nfiguring it couldn\u2019t hurt to try some aromatherapy during the long, quiet\nhours of the day, when her thoughts swarmed and descended, eating her up\nfrom the inside out. By the end of the week, she\u2019d bought three more and\nplaced them throughout her house.\nBryce breathed, \u201cIt seems like Philip Briggs might not have killed\nDanika.\u201d\nFor two years, part of her had clung to it\u2014that in the days following\nthe murder, they\u2019d found enough evidence to convict Briggs, who\u2019d wanted\nDanika dead for busting his rebel bomb ring. Briggs had denied it, but it\nhad added up: He\u2019d been caught purchasing black summoning salts in the\nweeks before his initial arrest, apparently to fuel some sort of new, horrible\nweapon.\nThat Danika had then been murdered by a Pit-level demon\u2014which\nwould have required the deadly black salt to summon it into this world\u2014\ncouldn\u2019t have been a coincidence. It seemed quite clear that Briggs had\nbeen released, gotten his hands on the black salt, summoned the demon, and\nset it loose upon Danika and the Pack of Devils. It had attacked the 33rd\nsoldier who\u2019d been patrolling the alleyway, and when its work was done, it\nhad been sent back to Hel by Briggs. Though he\u2019d never confessed to it, or\nwhat the breed even was, the fact remained that the demon hadn\u2019t been seen\nagain in two years. Since Briggs had been locked up. Case closed.\nFor two years, Bryce had clung to those facts. That even though her\nworld had fallen apart, the person responsible was behind bars. Forever.\nDeserving of every horror his jailors inflicted on him.\nJesiba let out a long, long breath. \u201cDid the angels accuse you of\nanything?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Not quite. \u201cThe Governor is coming here.\u201d\nAnother pause. \u201cTo interrogate you?\u201d\n\u201cI hope not.\u201d She liked her body parts where they were. \u201cHe wants to\ntalk to you, too.\u201d\n\u201cDoes Tertian\u2019s father know he\u2019s dead?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201cI need to make some phone calls,\u201d Jesiba said, more to herself.\n\u201cBefore the Governor comes.\u201d Bryce understood her meaning well enough:\nSo Maximus\u2019s father didn\u2019t show up at the gallery, demanding answers.\nBlaming Bryce for his death. It\u2019d be a mess.\nBryce wiped her sweaty palms on her thighs. \u201cThe Governor will be\nhere soon.\u201d\nFaint tapping sounded on the iron archives door before Lehabah\nwhispered, \u201cBB? Are you all right?\u201d\nBryce put a hand over the mouthpiece of her phone. \u201cGo back to your\npost, Lele.\u201d\n\u201cWere those two angels?\u201d\nBryce ground her teeth. \u201cYes. Go downstairs. Keep Syrinx quiet.\u201d\nLehabah let out a sigh, audible through six inches of iron. But the fire\nsprite didn\u2019t speak further, suggesting she\u2019d either returned to the archives\nbeneath the gallery or was still eavesdropping. Bryce didn\u2019t care, as long as\nshe and the chimera stayed quiet.\nJesiba was asking, \u201cWhen does Micah get there?\u201d\n\u201cEight minutes.\u201d\nJesiba considered. \u201cAll right.\u201d Bryce tried not to gape at the fact that\nshe didn\u2019t push for more time\u2014especially with a client\u2019s death in the\nbalance.\nBut even Jesiba knew not to screw around with an Archangel. Or\nmaybe she\u2019d finally found a scrap of empathy where Danika\u2019s murder was\nconcerned. She sure as Hel hadn\u2019t demonstrated it when she\u2019d ordered\nBryce to get back to work or be turned into a pig two weeks after Danika\u2019s\ndeath.\nJesiba said, \u201cI don\u2019t need to tell you to make sure everything is on\nlockdown.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll double-check.\u201d But she\u2019d made sure before the angels had even\nset foot in the gallery.\n\u201cThen you know what to do, Quinlan,\u201d Jesiba said, the sound of\nrustling sheets or clothes filling the background. Two male voices grumbled\nin protest. Then the line went dead.\nBlowing out a breath, Bryce launched into motion."}, "11": {"Name": "PART II THE TRENCH-Chapter 11", "Page Content": " 1 \nThe Archangel rang the buzzer precisely seven minutes later.\nCalming her panting, Bryce scanned the gallery for the tenth time,\nconfirming that all was in place, the art dust-free, any contraband stored\nbelow\u2014\nHer legs felt spindly, the old ache in her thigh clawing at the bone, but\nher hands remained steady as she reached the front door and hauled it open.\nThe Archangel was gorgeous. Horrifically, indecently gorgeous.\nHunt Athalar and Isaiah Tiberian stood behind him\u2014almost as good-\nlooking; the latter giving her another bland smile he obviously believed was\ncharming. The former \u2026 Hunt\u2019s dark eyes missed nothing.\nBryce lowered her head to the Governor, stepping back, her stupid\nheels wobbling on the carpet. \u201cWelcome, Your Grace. Please come in.\u201d\nMicah Domitus\u2019s brown eyes devoured her. His power pressed against\nher skin, ripped the air from the room, her lungs. Filled the space with\nmidnight storms, sex and death entwined.\n\u201cI assume your employer will be joining us through the vidscreen,\u201d the\nArchangel said, stepping in from the glaringly bright street.\nFucking Hel, his voice\u2014silk and steel and ancient stone. He could\nprobably make someone come by merely whispering filthy things in their\near.\nEven without that voice, it would have been impossible to forget what\nMicah was, what the Governor radiated with every breath, every blink.\nThere were currently ten Archangels who ruled the various territories of the\nRepublic, all bearing the title of Governor\u2014all answering only to the\nAsteri. An ordinary angel\u2019s magic might level a building if they were\nconsidered powerful. An Archangel\u2019s power could level an entire\nmetropolis. There was no predicting where the extra strength that separated\nArchangel from angel came from\u2014sometimes, it was passed on, usually\nupon the careful breeding orders of the Asteri. Other times, it popped up in\nunremarkable bloodlines.\nShe didn\u2019t know much about Micah\u2019s history\u2014had never paid\nattention during history class, too busy drooling over the unfairly perfect\nface currently before her to listen to her teacher\u2019s droning.\n\u201cMiss Roga is waiting for our call,\u201d she managed to say, and tried not\nto breathe too loudly as the Governor of Valbara swept past. One of his\npristine white feathers brushed her bare collarbone. She might have\nshuddered\u2014were it not for the two angels behind him.\nIsaiah just gave her a nod as he trailed Micah toward the chairs before\nthe desk.\nHunt Athalar, however, lingered. Holding her gaze\u2014before he glanced\nat her collarbone. As if the feather had left a mark. The tattoo of thorns\nacross his forehead seemed to turn darker.\nAnd just like that, that scent of sex rippling off the Archangel turned to\nrot.\nThe Asteri and the Archangels could have easily found another way to\nhobble the power of the Fallen, yet they\u2019d enslaved them with the witch\nspells woven into magical tattoos stamped onto their foreheads like fucked-\nup crowns. And the tattoos on their wrists: SPQM.\nSenatus Populusque Midgard.\nThe Midgard Senate and People. Total fucking bullshit. As if the\nSenate was anything but a puppet ruling body. As if the Asteri weren\u2019t their\nemperors and empresses, ruling over everything and everyone for eternity,\ntheir rotted souls regenerating from one form to the next.\nBryce shoved the thought from her mind as she shut the iron door\nbehind Hunt, just barely missing his gray feathers. His black eyes flashed\nwith warning.\nShe gave him a smile to convey everything she didn\u2019t dare say aloud\nregarding her feelings about this ambush. I\u2019ve faced worse than you, Umbra\nMortis. Glower and snarl all you like.\nHunt blinked, the only sign of his surprise, but Bryce was already\nturning toward her desk, trying not to limp as pain speared through her leg.\nShe\u2019d dragged up a third chair from the library, which had aggravated her\nleg further.\nShe didn\u2019t dare rub at the thick, curving scar across her upper thigh,\nhidden under her white dress. \u201cCan I get you anything, Your Grace?\nCoffee? Tea? Something stronger?\u201d She\u2019d already laid out bottled sparkling\nwater on the small tables between the chairs.\nThe Archangel had claimed the middle seat, and as she smiled politely\nat him, the weight of his gaze pressed on her like a silken blanket. \u201cI\u2019m\nfine.\u201d Bryce looked to Hunt and Isaiah, who slid into their chairs. \u201cThey\u2019re\nfine, too,\u201d Micah said.\nVery well, then. She strode around the desk, sliding her hand beneath\nits ledge to push a brass button and sending up a prayer to merciful Cthona\nthat her voice remained calm, even as her mind kept circling back to the\nsame thought, over and over: Briggs didn\u2019t kill Danika, Briggs didn\u2019t kill\nDanika, Briggs didn\u2019t kill Danika\u2014\nThe wood panel in the wall behind her split open, revealing a large\nscreen. As it flickered to life, she picked up the desk phone and dialed.\nBriggs had been a monster who had planned to hurt people, and he\ndeserved to be in jail, but\u2014he\u2019d been wrongly accused of the murder.\nDanika\u2019s killer was still out there.\nJesiba answered on the first ring. \u201cIs the screen ready?\u201d\n\u201cWhenever you are.\u201d Bryce typed the codes into her computer, trying\nto ignore the Governor staring at her like she was a steak and he was \u2026\nsomething that ate steak. Raw. And moaning. \u201cI\u2019m dialing you in,\u201d she\ndeclared.\nJesiba Roga appeared on the screen an instant later\u2014and they both\nhung up their phones.\nBehind the sorceress, the hotel suite was decorated in Pangeran\nsplendor: paneled white walls with gilded molding, plush cream carpets and\npale pink silk drapes, a four-poster oak bed big enough for her and the two\nmales Bryce had heard when she called before.\nJesiba played as hard as she worked while over on the massive\nterritory, seeking out more art for the gallery, either through visiting various\narchaeological digs or courting high-powered clients who already possessed\nthem.\nDespite having less than ten minutes, and despite using most of that\ntime to make some very important calls, Jesiba\u2019s flowing navy dress was\nimmaculate, revealing tantalizing glimpses of a lush female body adorned\nwith freshwater pearls at her ears and throat. Her cropped ash-blond hair\nglowed in the golden firstlight lamps\u2014cut shorter on the sides, longer on\nthe top. Effortlessly chic and casual. Her face \u2026\nHer face was both young and wise, bedroom-soft yet foreboding. Her\npale gray eyes gleamed with glittering magic, alluring and deadly.\nBryce had never dared ask why Jesiba had defected from the witches\ncenturies ago. Why she\u2019d aligned herself with the House of Flame and\nShadow and its leader, the Under-King\u2014and what she did for him. She\ncalled herself a sorceress now. Never a witch.\n\u201cMorning, Micah,\u201d Jesiba said mildly. A pleasant, disarming voice\ncompared to that of other members of Flame and Shadow\u2014the hoarse rasp\nof Reapers, or the silken tones of vampyrs.\n\u201cJesiba,\u201d Micah purred.\nJesiba gave him a slight smile, as if she\u2019d heard that purr a thousand\ndifferent times, from a thousand different males. \u201cPleased as I am to see\nyour handsome face, I\u2019d like to know why you called this meeting. Unless\nthe Danika thing was an excuse to talk to sweet Bryce.\u201d\nThe Danika thing. Bryce kept her face neutral, even as she felt Hunt\nwatching her carefully. As if he could hear her heart thundering, scent the\nsweat now coating her palms.\nBut Bryce gave him a bored look in return.\nMicah leaned back in his chair, crossing his long legs, and said without\nso much as glancing at Bryce, \u201cTempting as your assistant is, we have\nimportant matters to discuss.\u201d\nShe ignored the outright entitlement, the timbre of that sensual voice.\nTempting\u2014as if she were a piece of dessert on a platter. She was used to it,\nbut \u2026 these gods-damned Vanir males.\nJesiba waved with ethereal grace to continue, silver nails sparkling in\nthe hotel\u2019s lamplight.\nMicah said smoothly, \u201cI believe my triarii informed Miss Quinlan of\nthe murder last night. One that was an exact match for the deaths of Danika\nFendyr and the Pack of Devils two years ago.\u201d\nBryce kept herself still, unfeeling. She took a subtle inhale of the\nsoothing peppermint wisps from the infuser a few inches away.\nMicah went on, \u201cWhat they did not mention was the other\nconnection.\u201d\nThe two angels flanking the Governor stiffened almost imperceptibly.\nThis was clearly the first they were hearing of this as well.\n\u201cOh?\u201d Jesiba said. \u201cAnd do I have to pay for this information?\u201d\nVast, cold power crackled in the gallery, but the Archangel\u2019s face\nremained unreadable. \u201cI am sharing this information so we might combine\nresources.\u201d\nJesiba arched a blond brow with preternatural smoothness. \u201cTo do\nwhat?\u201d\nMicah said, \u201cFor Bryce Quinlan to find the true murderer behind this,\nof course.\u201d"}, "12": {"Name": "PART II THE TRENCH-Chapter 12", "Page Content": " 2 \nBryce had gone still as death\u2014so unmoving that Hunt wondered if she\nknew it was a solid tell. Not about her own nerves, but about her heritage.\nOnly the Fae could go that still.\nHer boss, the young-faced sorceress, sighed. \u201cIs your 33rd so\nincompetent these days that you truly need my assistant\u2019s help?\u201d Her lovely\nvoice hardly softened her question. \u201cThough I suppose I already have my\nanswer, if you falsely convicted Philip Briggs.\u201d\nHunt didn\u2019t dare grin at her outright challenge. Few people could get\naway with speaking to Micah Domitus, let alone any Archangel, like that.\nHe considered the four-hundred-year-old sorceress on the screen. He\u2019d\nheard the rumors: that Jesiba answered to the Under-King, that she could\ntransform people into common animals if they provoked her, that she\u2019d\nonce been a witch who\u2019d left her clan for reasons still unknown. Most likely\nbad ones, if she\u2019d wound up a member of the House of Flame and Shadow.\nBryce breathed, \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about this. Or who wanted to\nkill Tertian.\u201d\nJesiba sharpened her gaze. \u201cRegardless, you are my assistant. You\ndon\u2019t work for the 33rd.\u201d\nMicah\u2019s mouth tightened. Hunt braced himself. \u201cI invited you to this\nmeeting, Jesiba, as a courtesy.\u201d His brown eyes narrowed with distaste. \u201cIt\ndoes indeed appear that Philip Briggs was wrongly convicted. But the fact\nremains that Danika Fendyr and the Pack of Devils apprehended him in his\nlaboratory, with undeniable evidence regarding his intention to bomb\ninnocents at the White Raven nightclub. And though he was initially\nreleased due to a loophole, in the past two years, enough evidence has been\nfound for his earlier crimes that he has been convicted of them, too. As\nsuch, he will remain behind bars and serve out the sentence for those earlier\ncrimes as leader of the now-inactive Keres sect, and his participation in the\nlarger human rebellion.\u201d\nQuinlan seemed to sag with relief.\nBut then Micah went on, \u201cHowever, this means a dangerous murderer\nremains loose in this city, able to summon a lethal demon\u2014for sport or\nrevenge, we do not know. I will admit that my 33rd and the Auxiliary have\nexhausted their resources. But the Summit is in just over a month. There are\nindividuals attending who will see these murders as proof that I am not in\ncontrol of my city, let alone this territory, and seek to use it against me.\u201d\nOf course it wasn\u2019t about catching a deadly killer. No, this was pure\nPR.\nEven with the Summit so far off, Hunt and the other triarii had been\nprepping for weeks now, getting the units in the 33rd ready for the pomp\nand bullshit that surrounded the gathering of Valbaran powers every ten\nyears. Leaders from across the territory would attend, airing their\ngrievances, with maybe a few guest appearances from the ruling assholes\nacross the Haldren.\nHunt hadn\u2019t yet attended one in Valbara, but he\u2019d been through plenty\nof other Summits in Pangera, with rulers who all pretended they had some\nsemblance of free will. The Summit meetings usually amounted to a week\nof powerful Vanir arguing until the overseeing Archangel laid down the law.\nHe had little doubt Micah would be any different. Isaiah had experienced\none already, and had warned him that the Archangel liked to flex his\nmilitary might at the Summits\u2014liked to have the 33rd in marching and\nflying formation, decked out in imperial regalia.\nHunt\u2019s golden breastplate was already being cleaned. The thought of\ndonning the formal armor, the seven stars of the Asteri\u2019s crest displayed\nacross his heart, made him want to puke.\nJesiba examined her silver nails. \u201cAnything exciting happening at the\nSummit this time?\u201d\nMicah seemed to weigh Jesiba\u2019s casual expression as he said, \u201cThe\nnew witch-queen will be formally recognized.\u201d\nJesiba didn\u2019t let one speck of emotion show. \u201cI heard of Hecuba\u2019s\npassing,\u201d the sorceress said. No tinge of grief or satisfaction. Just fact.\nBut Quinlan tensed, as if she\u2019d shout at them to get back to the murder.\nMicah added, \u201cAnd the Asteri are sending Sandriel to deliver a report from\nthe Senate regarding the rebel conflict.\u201d\nEvery thought eddied out of Hunt\u2019s head. Even the usually unflappable\nIsaiah went rigid.\nSandriel was coming here.\nMicah was saying, \u201cSandriel will arrive at the Comitium next week,\nand at the Asteri\u2019s request, she will be my guest until the Summit.\u201d\nA month. That fucking monster would be in this city for a month.\nJesiba angled her head with unnerving grace. She might not have been\na Reaper, but she sure as shit moved like one. \u201cWhat does my assistant have\nto offer in finding the murderer?\u201d\nHunt shoved it down\u2014the roaring, the trembling, the stillness. Shoved\nit down and down and down until it was just another wave in the black,\nroiling pit inside himself. Forced himself to concentrate on the\nconversation. And not on the psychopath on her way to this city.\nMicah\u2019s stare settled on Bryce, who had turned so pale her freckles\nwere like splattered blood across the bridge of her nose. \u201cMiss Quinlan is,\nthus far, the only person alive to have witnessed the demon the murderer\nsummoned.\u201d\nBryce had the nerve to ask, \u201cWhat about the angel in the alley?\u201d\nMicah\u2019s face remained unchanged. \u201cHe had no memories of the attack.\nIt was an ambush.\u201d Before Bryce could push, he went on, \u201cConsidering the\ndelicate nature of this investigation, I am now willing to look outside the\nbox, as they say, for assistance in solving these murders before they become\na true problem.\u201d\nMeaning, the Archangel needed to look good in front of the powers\nthat be. In front of Sandriel, who would report it all to the Asteri and their\npuppet Senate.\nA murderer on the loose, capable of summoning a demon that could\nkill Vanir as easily as humans? Oh, it\u2019d be precisely the sort of shit Sandriel\nwould delight in telling the Asteri. Especially if it cost Micah his position.\nAnd if she gained it for herself. What was the northwestern quadrant of\nPangera compared to all of Valbara? And Micah losing everything meant\nhis slaves\u2014Hunt, Isaiah, Justinian, and so many others\u2014went to whoever\ninherited his Governor\u2019s title.\nSandriel would never honor Micah\u2019s bargain with Hunt.\nMicah turned to Hunt, a cruel tilt to his lips. \u201cYou can guess, Athalar,\nwho Sandriel will be bringing with her.\u201d Hunt went rigid. \u201cPollux would be\nall too happy to report his findings as well.\u201d\nHunt fought to master his breathing, to keep his face neutral.\nPollux Antonius, Sandriel\u2019s triarii commander\u2014the Malleus, they\ncalled him. The Hammer. As cruel and merciless as Sandriel. And an\nabsolute motherfucking asshole.\nJesiba cleared her throat. \u201cAnd you still don\u2019t know what kind of\ndemon it was?\u201d She leaned back in her chair, a frown on her full mouth.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Micah said through his teeth.\nIt was true. Even Hunt hadn\u2019t been able to identify it, and he\u2019d had the\ndistinct pleasure of killing more demons than he could count. They came in\nendless breeds and levels of intelligence, ranging from the beasts that\nresembled feline-canine hybrids to the humanoid, shape-shifting princes\nwho ruled over Hel\u2019s seven territories, each one darker than the last: the\nHollow, the Trench, the Canyon, the Ravine, the Chasm, the Abyss, and the\nworst of them all\u2014the Pit.\nEven without a specific identification, though, given its speed and\nwhat it had done, the demon fit with something belonging to the Pit,\nperhaps a pet of the Star-Eater himself. Only in the depths of the Pit could\nsomething like that evolve\u2014a creature who had never seen light, never\nneeded it.\nIt didn\u2019t matter, Hunt supposed. Whether the demon was accustomed\nto light or not, his particular skills could still turn it into chunks of sizzling\nmeat. A quick flash of light and a demon would either turn tail or writhe in\npain.\nQuinlan\u2019s voice cut through the storm in Hunt\u2019s head. \u201cYou said that\nthere was another connection between the murders then and the one now.\nBeyond the \u2026 style.\u201d\nMicah looked at her. To her credit, Quinlan didn\u2019t lower her eyes.\n\u201cMaximus Tertian and Danika Fendyr were friends.\u201d\nBryce\u2019s brows twitched toward each other. \u201cDanika didn\u2019t know\nTertian.\u201d\nMicah sighed toward the wood-paneled ceiling high above. \u201cI suspect\nthere might have been a good deal about which she didn\u2019t inform you.\u201d\n\u201cI would have known if she was friends with Maximus Tertian,\u201d\nQuinlan ground out.\nMicah\u2019s power murmured through the room. \u201cCareful, Miss Quinlan.\u201d\nNo one took that kind of tone with an Archangel, at least not anyone\nwith nearly zero power in their veins. It was enough to get Hunt to set aside\nSandriel\u2019s visit and focus on the conversation.\nMicah went on, \u201cThere is also the fact that you knew both Danika and\nMaximus Tertian. That you were at the White Raven nightclub on each of\nthe nights the murders happened. The similarity is enough to be \u2026 of\ninterest.\u201d\nJesiba straightened. \u201cAre you saying that Bryce is a suspect?\u201d\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d Micah said coldly. \u201cBut anything is possible.\u201d\nQuinlan\u2019s fingers curled into fists, her knuckles going white as she no\ndoubt tried to restrain herself from spitting at the Archangel. She opted to\nchange the subject instead. \u201cWhat about investigating the others in the Pack\nof Devils? None of them might have been a target?\u201d\n\u201cIt has already been looked into and dismissed. Danika remains our\nfocus.\u201d\nBryce asked tightly, \u201cYou honestly think I can find anything, when the\nAux and 33rd couldn\u2019t? Why not get the Asteri to send over someone like\nthe Hind?\u201d\nThe question rippled through the room. Surely Quinlan wasn\u2019t dumb\nenough to wish for that. Jesiba threw a warning look at her assistant.\nMicah, unfazed by the mention of Lidia Cervos, the Republic\u2019s most\nnotorious spy-hunter\u2014and breaker\u2014replied, \u201cAs I said, I do not wish for\nknowledge of these \u2026 events to pass beyond the walls of my city.\u201d\nHunt heard what Micah left unspoken: despite being part of Sandriel\u2019s\ntriarii, the deer shifter known as the Hind reported directly to the Asteri and\nwas known to be Pollux\u2019s lover.\nThe Hammer and the Hind\u2014the smasher of battlefields and the\ndestroyer of the Republic\u2019s enemies. Hunt had seen the Hind a few times in\nSandriel\u2019s stronghold and always walked away unnerved by her unreadable\ngolden eyes. Lidia was as beautiful as she was ruthless in her pursuit of\nrebel spies. A perfect match for Pollux. The only one who might have suited\nPollux more than the Hind was the Harpy, but Hunt tried not to think about\nthe second in command of Sandriel\u2019s triarii when he could avoid it.\nHunt smothered his rising dread. Micah was saying, \u201cCrime statistics\nsuggest that it\u2019s likely Danika knew her killer.\u201d Another pointed silence that\nleft Quinlan bristling. \u201cAnd despite the things she might not have told you,\nyou remain the person who knew Danika Fendyr better than anyone. I\nbelieve you can provide unparalleled insight.\u201d\nJesiba leaned toward the screen in her plush hotel room, all grace and\nrestrained power. \u201cAll right, Governor. Let\u2019s say you commandeer Bryce to\nlook into this. I\u2019d like compensation.\u201d\nMicah smiled, a sharp, thrilling thing that Hunt had witnessed only\nbefore the Archangel blasted someone into wind-torn smithereens.\n\u201cRegardless of your allegiance to the Under-King, and the protection you\nbelieve it affords you, you remain a citizen of the Republic.\u201d\nAnd you will answer to me, he didn\u2019t need to add.\nJesiba said simply, \u201cI\u2019d think you\u2019d be well versed in the bylaws,\nGovernor. Section Fifty-Seven: If a government official requires the\nservices of an outside contractor, they are to pay\u2014\u201d\n\u201cFine. You will send your invoice to me.\u201d Micah\u2019s wings rustled, the\nonly sign of his impatience. But his voice was kind, at least, as he turned to\nQuinlan. \u201cI am out of options, and shall soon be out of time. If there is\nsomeone who might retrace Danika\u2019s steps in her final days and discover\nwho murdered her, it would be you. You are the only tie between the\nvictims.\u201d She just gaped. \u201cI believe your position here at the gallery also\ngrants you access to individuals who might not be willing to talk to the 33rd\nor Auxiliary. Isaiah Tiberian will report to me on any progress you make,\nand keep a keen eye on this investigation.\u201d His brown eyes appraised Hunt,\nas if he could read every line of tension on his body, the panic seeping\nthrough his veins at the news of Sandriel\u2019s arrival. \u201cHunt Athalar is\nexperienced in hunting demons. He shall be on protection duty, guarding\nyou during your search for the person behind this.\u201d\nBryce\u2019s eyes narrowed, but Hunt didn\u2019t dare say a word. To blink his\ndispleasure\u2014and relief.\nAt least he would have an excuse not to be at the Comitium while\nSandriel and Pollux were around. But to be a glorified babysitter, to not be\nable to work toward earning back his debts \u2026\n\u201cVery well,\u201d Jesiba said. Her gaze slid to her assistant. \u201cBryce?\u201d\nBryce said quietly, her amber eyes full of cold fire, \u201cI\u2019ll find them.\u201d\nShe met the Archangel\u2019s gaze. \u201cAnd then I want you to wipe them off the\nfucking planet.\u201d\nYeah, Quinlan had balls. She was stupid and brash, but at least she had\nnerve. The combination, however, would likely see her dead before she\ncompleted the Drop.\nMicah smiled, as if realizing that, too. \u201cWhat is done with the\nmurderer will be up to our justice system.\u201d Mild, bureaucratic nonsense,\neven as the Archangel\u2019s power thundered through the room, as if promising\nQuinlan he\u2019d do exactly as she wished.\nBryce muttered, \u201cFine.\u201d\nJesiba Roga frowned at her assistant, noting that her face still burned\nwith that cold fire. \u201cDo try not to die, Bryce. I\u2019d hate to endure the\ninconvenience of training someone new.\u201d The feed cut off.\nBryce stood in those absurd shoes. Walking around the desk, she swept\nthe silky curtain of red hair over a shoulder, the slightly curled ends almost\nbrushing the generous curve of her ass.\nMicah stood, eyes sliding down Bryce as if he, too, noted that\nparticular detail, but said to none of them in particular, \u201cWe\u2019re done here.\u201d\nBryce\u2019s dress was so tight that Hunt could see the muscles in her\nthighs strain as she hauled open the iron door for the Archangel. A faint\nwince passed over her face\u2014then vanished.\nHunt reached her as the Archangel and his Commander paused outside.\nShe only gave Hunt a winning, bland smile and began closing the door on\nhim before he could step onto the dusty street. He wedged a foot between\nthe door and jamb, and the enchantments zinged and snapped against his\nskin as they tried to align around him. Her amber eyes flared. \u201cWhat.\u201d\nHunt gave her a sharp grin. \u201cMake a list of suspects today. Anyone\nwho might have wanted Danika and her pack dead.\u201d If Danika knew her\nmurderer, odds were that Bryce probably did, too. \u201cAnd make a list of\nDanika\u2019s locations and activities during the last few days of her life.\u201d\nBryce only smiled again, as if she hadn\u2019t heard a damn word he said.\nBut then she hit some button beside the door that had the enchantments\nburning like acid\u2014\nHunt jumped back, his lightning flaring, defending against an enemy\nthat was not there.\nThe door shut. She purred through the intercom, \u201cI\u2019ll call you. Don\u2019t\nbother me until then.\u201d\nUrd fucking spare him."}, "13": {"Name": "PART II THE TRENCH-Chapter 13", "Page Content": " 3 \nAtop the roof of the gallery a moment later, Isaiah silent at his side, Hunt\nwatched the late morning sunlight gild Micah\u2019s pristine white wings and set\nthe strands of gold in his hair to near-glowing as the Archangel inspected\nthe walled city sprawled around them.\nHunt instead surveyed the flat roof, broken up only by equipment and\nthe doorway to the gallery below.\nMicah\u2019s wings shifted, his only warning that he was about to speak.\n\u201cTime is not our ally.\u201d\nHunt just said, \u201cDo you really think Quinlan can find whoever is\nbehind this?\u201d He let the question convey the extent of his own faith in her.\nMicah angled his head. An ancient, lethal predator sizing up prey. \u201cI\nthink this is a matter that requires us to use every weapon in our arsenal, no\nmatter how unorthodox.\u201d He sighed as he looked out at the city again.\nLunathion had been built as a model of the ancient coastal cities\naround the Rhagan Sea, a near-exact replica that included its sandstone\nwalls, the arid climate, the olive groves and little farms that lined distant\nhills beyond the city borders to the north, even the great temple to a patron\ngoddess in the very center. But unlike those cities, this one had been\nallowed to adapt: streets lay in an orderly grid, not a tangle; and modern\nbuildings jutted up like lances in the heart of the CBD, far surpassing the\nstrict height codes of Pangera.\nMicah had been responsible for it\u2014for seeing this city as a tribute to\nthe old model, but also a place for the future to thrive. He\u2019d even embraced\nusing the name Crescent City over Lunathion.\nA male of progress. Of tolerance, they said.\nHunt often wondered what it would feel like to rip out his throat.\nHe\u2019d contemplated it so many times he\u2019d lost count. Had contemplated\nblasting a bolt of his lightning into that beautiful face, that perfect mask for\nthe brutal, demanding bastard inside.\nMaybe it was unfair. Micah had been born into his power, had never\nknown a life as anything but one of the major forces on this planet. A near-\ngod who was unused to having his authority questioned and would put\ndown any threats to it.\nA rebellion led by a fellow Archangel and three thousand warriors had\nbeen just that. Even though nearly all of his triarii was now made up of the\nFallen. Offering them a second chance, apparently. Hunt couldn\u2019t fathom\nwhy he\u2019d bother being that merciful.\nMicah said, \u201cSabine is certainly already putting her people on this case\nand will be visiting my office to tell me precisely what she thinks of the\nfuckup with Briggs.\u201d An icy glance between them. \u201cI want us to find the\nmurderer, not the wolves.\u201d\nHunt said coolly, \u201cDead or alive?\u201d\n\u201cAlive, preferably. But dead is better than letting the person run free.\u201d\nHunt dared ask, \u201cAnd will this investigation count toward my quota? It\ncould take months.\u201d\nIsaiah tensed. But Micah\u2019s mouth curled upward. For a long moment,\nhe said nothing. Hunt didn\u2019t so much as blink.\nThen Micah said, \u201cHow about this incentive, Athalar: you solve this\ncase quickly\u2014you solve it before the Summit, and I\u2019ll lower your debts to\nten.\u201d\nThe very wind seemed to halt.\n\u201cTen,\u201d Hunt managed to say, \u201cmore assignments?\u201d\nIt was outrageous. Micah had no reason to offer him anything. Not\nwhen his word was all that was needed for Hunt to obey.\n\u201cTen more assignments,\u201d Micah said, as if he hadn\u2019t dropped a fucking\nbomb into the middle of Hunt\u2019s life.\nIt could be a fool\u2019s bargain. Micah might draw out those ten\nassignments over decades, but \u2026 Burning fucking Solas.\nThe Archangel added, \u201cYou tell no one about this, Athalar.\u201d That he\ndidn\u2019t bother to also warn Isaiah suggested enough about how much he\ntrusted his commander.\nHunt said, as calmly as he could, \u201cAll right.\u201d\nMicah\u2019s stare turned merciless, though. He scanned Hunt from head to\ntoe. Then the gallery beneath their booted feet. The assistant within it.\nMicah growled, \u201cKeep your dick in your pants and your hands to yourself.\nOr you\u2019ll find yourself without either for a long while.\u201d\nHunt would regrow both, of course. Any immortal who made the Drop\ncould regrow just about anything if they weren\u2019t beheaded or severely\nmutilated, with arteries bleeding out, but \u2026 the recovery would be painful.\nSlow. And being dickless, even for a few months, wasn\u2019t high up on Hunt\u2019s\nto-do list.\nFucking around with a half-human assistant was the least of his\npriorities, anyway, with freedom potentially ten kills away.\nIsaiah nodded for both of them. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep it professional.\u201d\nMicah twisted toward the CBD, assessing the river breeze, his pristine\nwings twitching. He said to Isaiah, \u201cBe in my office in an hour.\u201d\nIsaiah bowed at the waist to the Archangel, a Pangeran gesture that\nmade Hunt\u2019s hackles rise. He\u2019d been forced to do that, at the risk of having\nhis feathers pulled out, burned off, sliced apart. Those initial decades after\nthe Fall had not been kind.\nThe wings he knew were mounted to the wall in the Asteri throne room\nwere proof.\nBut Isaiah had always known how to play the game, how to stomach\ntheir protocols and hierarchies. How to dress like them, dine and fuck like\nthem. He\u2019d Fallen and risen back to the rank of commander because of it. It\nwouldn\u2019t surprise anyone if Micah recommended that Isaiah\u2019s halo be\nremoved at the next Governors\u2019 Council with the Asteri after the Winter\nSolstice.\nNo assassinating, butchering, or torturing required.\nMicah didn\u2019t so much as glance at them before he shot into the skies.\nWithin seconds he\u2019d become a white speck in the sea of blue.\nIsaiah blew out a breath, frowning toward the spires atop the five\ntowers of the Comitium, a glass-and-steel crown rising from the heart of the\nCBD.\n\u201cYou think there\u2019s a catch?\u201d Hunt asked his friend.\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t scheme like that.\u201d Like Sandriel and most of the other\nArchangels. \u201cHe means what he says. He\u2019s got to be desperate, if he wants\nto give you that kind of motivation.\u201d\n\u201cHe owns me. His word is my command.\u201d\n\u201cWith Sandriel coming, maybe he realized it\u2019d be advantageous if you\nwere inclined to be \u2026 loyal.\u201d\n\u201cAgain: slave.\u201d\n\u201cThen I don\u2019t fucking know, Hunt. Maybe he was just feeling\ngenerous.\u201d Isaiah shook his head again. \u201cDon\u2019t question the hand Urd dealt\nyou.\u201d\nHunt blew out a breath. \u201cI know.\u201d Odds were, the truth was a\ncombination of those things.\nIsaiah arched a brow. \u201cYou think you can find whoever is behind this?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d Not with this new bargain on the table. He\ntasted the dry wind, half listening to its rasping song through the sacred\ncypresses lining the street below\u2014the thousands of them in this city planted\nin honor of its patron goddess.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll find them,\u201d Isaiah said. \u201cI know you will.\u201d\n\u201cIf I can stop thinking about Sandriel\u2019s visit.\u201d Hunt blew out a breath,\ndragging his hands through his hair. \u201cI can\u2019t believe she\u2019s coming here.\nWith that piece of shit Pollux.\u201d\nIsaiah said carefully, \u201cTell me you realize that Micah threw you\nanother big fucking bone just now in stationing you to protect Quinlan\ninstead of keeping you around the Comitium with Sandriel there.\u201d\nHunt knew that, knew Micah was well aware of how Hunt felt about\nSandriel and Pollux, but rolled his eyes. \u201cWhatever. Trumpet all you want\nabout how fantastic Micah is, but remember that the bastard is welcoming\nher with open arms.\u201d\n\u201cThe Asteri ordered her to come for the Summit,\u201d Isaiah countered.\n\u201cIt\u2019s standard for them to send one of the Archangels as their emissary to\nthese meetings. Governor Ephraim came to the last one here. Micah\nwelcomed him, too.\u201d\nHunt said, \u201cThe fact remains that she\u2019ll be here for a whole month. In\nthat fucking complex.\u201d He pointed to the five buildings of the Comitium.\n\u201cLunathion isn\u2019t her scene. There\u2019s nothing to amuse her here.\u201d\nWith most of the Fallen either scattered to the four winds or dead,\nSandriel enjoyed nothing better than strolling through her castle dungeons,\ncrammed full of human rebels, and selecting one, two, or three at a time.\nThe arena at the heart of her city was just for the pleasure of destroying\nthese prisoners in various ways. Battles to the death, public torture,\nunleashing Lowers and basic animals against them \u2026 There was no end to\nher creativity. Hunt had seen and endured it all.\nWith the conflict currently surging, those dungeons were sure to be\npacked. Sandriel and Pollux must have been enjoying the Hel out of the\npain that flowed from that arena.\nThe thought made Hunt stiffen. \u201cPollux will be a fucking menace in\nthis city.\u201d The Hammer was well known for his favorite activities: slaughter\nand torture.\n\u201cPollux will be dealt with. Micah knows what he\u2019s like\u2014what he does.\nThe Asteri might have ordered him to welcome Sandriel, but he isn\u2019t going\nto let her give Pollux free rein.\u201d Isaiah paused, eyes going distant as he\nseemed to weigh something internally. \u201cBut I can make you unavailable\nwhile Sandriel visits\u2014permanently.\u201d\nHunt lifted an eyebrow. \u201cIf you\u2019re referring to Micah\u2019s promise to\nmake me dickless, I\u2019ll pass.\u201d\nIsaiah laughed quietly. \u201cMicah gave you an order to investigate with\nQuinlan. Orders that will make you very, very busy. Especially if he wants\nBryce protected.\u201d\nHunt threw him a half grin. \u201cSo busy that I won\u2019t have time to be\naround the Comitium.\u201d\n\u201cSo busy that you\u2019ll be staying on the roof across from Quinlan\u2019s\nbuilding to monitor her.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve slept in worse conditions.\u201d So had Isaiah. \u201cAnd it\u2019d be an easy\ncover for keeping an eye on Quinlan for more than protection.\u201d\nIsaiah frowned. \u201cYou honestly mark her as a suspect?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not ruling it out,\u201d Hunt said, shrugging. \u201cMicah didn\u2019t clear her,\neither. So until she proves otherwise, she\u2019s not off my list.\u201d He wondered\nwho the Hel might make it onto Quinlan\u2019s list of suspects. When Isaiah only\nnodded, Hunt asked, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to tell Micah I\u2019m watching her\naround the clock?\u201d\n\u201cIf he notices that you\u2019re not sleeping at the barracks, I\u2019ll tell him. But\nuntil then, what he doesn\u2019t know won\u2019t hurt him.\u201d\n\u201cThanks.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a word in Hunt\u2019s normal vocabulary, not to anyone\nwith wings, but he meant it. Isaiah had always been the best of them\u2014the\nbest of the Fallen, and all the legionaries Hunt had ever served with. Isaiah\nshould have been in the Asterian Guard, with those skills and those pristine\nwhite wings, but like Hunt, Isaiah had come from the gutter. Only the\nhighborn would do for the Asteri\u2019s elite private legion. Even if it meant\npassing over good soldiers like Isaiah.\nHunt, with his gray wings and common blood, despite his lightning,\nhad never even been in the running. Being asked to join Shahar\u2019s elite 18th\nhad been privilege enough. He\u2019d loved her almost instantly for seeing his\nworth\u2014and Isaiah\u2019s. All of the 18th had been like that: soldiers she\u2019d\nselected not for their status, but their skills. Their true value.\nIsaiah gestured toward the CBD and the Comitium within it. \u201cGrab\nyour gear from the barracks. I need to make a stop before I meet with\nMicah.\u201d At Hunt\u2019s blink, Isaiah winced. \u201cI owe Prince Ruhn a visit to\nconfirm Quinlan\u2019s alibi.\u201d\nIt was the last fucking thing Hunt wanted to do, and the last fucking\nthing he knew Isaiah wanted to do, but protocols were protocols. \u201cYou want\nme to go with you?\u201d Hunt offered. It was the least he could offer.\nThe corner of Isaiah\u2019s mouth lifted. \u201cConsidering that you broke\nDanaan\u2019s nose the last time you were in a room together, I\u2019m going to say\nno.\u201d\nWise move. Hunt drawled, \u201cHe deserved it.\u201d\nMicah, mercifully, had found the entire event\u2014the Incident, as Naomi\ncalled it\u2014amusing. It wasn\u2019t every day that the Fae had their asses handed\nto them, so even the Governor had discreetly gloated over the altercation at\nthe Spring Equinox celebrations the previous year. He\u2019d given Hunt a\nwhole week off for it. A suspension, Micah had claimed\u2014but that\nsuspension had come with an especially padded paycheck. And three less\ndeaths to atone for.\nIsaiah said, \u201cI\u2019ll call you later to check in.\u201d\n\u201cGood luck.\u201d\nIsaiah threw him a weary, worn smile\u2014the only hint of the grind of all\nthese years with those two tattoos\u2014and went to track down Ruhn Danaan,\nthe Crown Prince of the Fae.\nBryce paced the showroom once, hissed at the pain in her leg, and kicked\noff her heels hard enough that one slammed into the wall, setting an ancient\nvase shuddering.\nA cool voice asked behind her, \u201cWhen you nail Hunt Athalar\u2019s balls to\nthe wall, will you do me a favor and take a picture?\u201d\nShe glared at the vidscreen that had come on again\u2014and the sorceress\nstill sitting there. \u201cYou really want to get mixed up in this, boss?\u201d\nJesiba leaned back in her gilded chair, a queen at ease. \u201cGood old-\nfashioned revenge doesn\u2019t hold any appeal?\u201d\n\u201cI have no idea who wanted Danika and the pack dead. None.\u201d It had\nmade sense when it seemed like Briggs had summoned the demon to do it:\nhe\u2019d been released that day, Danika was on edge and upset about it, and\nthen she had died. But if it wasn\u2019t Briggs, and with Maximus Tertian killed\n\u2026 She didn\u2019t know where to start.\nBut she\u2019d do it. Find whoever had done this. A small part of it was just\nto make Micah Domitus eat his words hinting that she might be of interest\nin this case, but \u2026 She ground her teeth. She\u2019d find whoever had done this\nand make them regret ever being born.\nBryce walked over to the desk, stifling the limp. She perched on the\nedge. \u201cThe Governor must be desperate.\u201d And insane, if he was asking for\nher help.\n\u201cI don\u2019t care about the Governor\u2019s agenda,\u201d Jesiba said. \u201cPlay\nvengeful detective all you want, Bryce, but do remember that you have a\njob. Client meetings will not take a back seat.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d Bryce chewed on the inside of her cheek. \u201cIf whoever is\nbehind this is strong enough to summon a demon like that to do their dirty\nwork, I\u2019ll likely wind up dead, too.\u201d Very likely, given that she hadn\u2019t\ndecided if or when to make the Drop yet.\nThose gray glittering eyes roved over her face. \u201cThen keep Athalar\nclose.\u201d\nBryce bristled. As if she were some little female in need of a big,\nstrong warrior to guard her.\nEven if it was partially true. Mostly true.\nTotally and definitely true, if that demon was being summoned again.\nBut\u2014make a list of suspects, indeed. And the other task he\u2019d given\nher, to make a list of Danika\u2019s last locations \u2026 Her body tightened at the\nthought.\nShe might accept Athalar\u2019s protection, but she didn\u2019t need to make it\neasy for the swaggering asshole.\nJesiba\u2019s phone rang. The female glanced at the screen. \u201cIt\u2019s Tertian\u2019s\nfather.\u201d She threw Bryce a warning glare. \u201cIf I start losing money because\nyou\u2019re off playing detective with the Umbra Mortis, I\u2019ll turn you into a\nturtle.\u201d She lifted the phone to her ear and the feed ended.\nBryce blew out a long breath before she hit the button to close the\nscreen into the wall.\nThe silence of the gallery twined around her, gnawing at her bones.\nLehabah for once, seemed to not be eavesdropping. No tapping on the\niron door filled the thrumming silence. Not a whisper of the tiny, incurably\nnosy fire sprite.\nBryce braced her arm on the cool surface of the desk, cupping her\nforehead in her hand.\nDanika had never mentioned knowing Tertian. They\u2019d never even\nspoken of him\u2014not once. And that was all she had to go on?\nWithout Briggs as the summoner-killer, the murder didn\u2019t make sense.\nWhy had the demon chosen their apartment, when it was three stories up\nand located in a supposedly monitored building? It had to be intentional.\nDanika and the others, Tertian included, must have been targeted, with\nBryce\u2019s connection to the latter a sick coincidence.\nBryce toyed with the amulet on the end of her golden chain, zipping it\nback and forth.\nLater. She\u2019d think it over tonight, because\u2014she glanced at the clock.\nShit.\nShe had another client coming in forty-five minutes, which meant she\nshould get through the tsunami of paperwork for the Svadgard wood\ncarving purchased yesterday.\nOr maybe she should work on that job application she\u2019d kept in a\nsecret, deceptively named file on her computer: Paper Vendor\nSpreadsheets.\nJesiba, who left her in charge of everything from restocking toilet\npaper to ordering printer paper, would never open the file. She\u2019d never see\nthat among the actual documents Bryce had thrown in there, there was one\nfolder\u2014March Office Supply Invoices\u2014that didn\u2019t contain a spreadsheet. It\nheld a cover letter, a r\u00e9sum\u00e9, and half-completed applications for positions\nat about ten different places.\nSome were long shots. Crescent City Art Museum Associate Curator.\nAs if she\u2019d ever get that job, when she had neither an art nor a history\ndegree. And when most museums believed places like Griffin Antiquities\nshould be illegal.\nOther positions\u2014Personal Assistant to Miss Fancypants Lawyer\u2014\nwould be more of the same. Different setting and boss, but same old\nbullshit.\nBut they were a way out. Yeah, she\u2019d have to find some kind of\narrangement with Jesiba regarding her debts, and avoid finding out if just\nmentioning she wanted to leave would get her turned into some slithering\nanimal, but dicking around with the applications, endlessly tweaking her\nr\u00e9sum\u00e9\u2014it made her feel better, at least. Some days.\nBut if Danika\u2019s murderer had resurfaced, if being in this dead-end job\ncould help \u2026 Those r\u00e9sum\u00e9s were a waste of time.\nHer phone\u2019s dark screen barely reflected the lights high, high above.\nSighing again, Bryce punched in her security code, and opened the\nmessage thread.\nYou won\u2019t regret this. I\u2019ve had a long while to figure out all the ways\nI\u2019m going to spoil you. All the fun we\u2019re going to have.\nShe could have recited Connor\u2019s messages from memory, but it hurt\nmore to see them. Hurt enough to feel through every part of her body, the\ndark remnants of her soul. So she always looked.\nGo enjoy yourself. I\u2019ll see you in a few days.\nThe white screen burned her eyes. Message me when you\u2019re home\nsafe.\nShe shut that window. And didn\u2019t dare open up her audiomail. She\nusually had to be in one of her monthly emotional death-spirals to do that.\nTo hear Danika\u2019s laughing voice again.\nBryce loosed a long breath, then another, then another.\nShe\u2019d find the person behind this. For Danika, for the Pack of Devils,\nshe\u2019d do it. Do anything.\nShe opened up her phone again and began typing out a group message\nto Juniper and Fury. Not that Fury ever replied\u2014no, the thread was a two-\nway conversation between Bryce and June. She\u2019d written out half of her\nmessage: Philip Briggs didn\u2019t kill Danika. The murders are starting again\nand I\u2019m\u2014 when she deleted it. Micah had given an order to keep this quiet,\nand if her phone was hacked \u2026 She wouldn\u2019t jeopardize being taken off the\ncase.\nFury had to know about it already. That her so-called friend hadn\u2019t\ncontacted her \u2026 Bryce shoved the thought away. She\u2019d tell Juniper face-to-\nface. If Micah was right and there was somehow a connection between\nBryce and how the victims were chosen, she couldn\u2019t risk leaving Juniper\nunaware. Wouldn\u2019t lose anyone else.\nBryce glanced at the sealed iron door. Rubbed the deep ache in her leg\nonce before standing.\nSilence walked beside her during the entire trip downstairs."}, "14": {"Name": "PART II THE TRENCH-Chapter 14", "Page Content": " 4 \nRuhn Danaan stood before the towering oak doors to his father\u2019s study and\ntook a bracing, cooling breath.\nIt had nothing to do with the thirty-block run he\u2019d made from his\nunofficial office above a dive bar in the Old Square over to his father\u2019s\nsprawling marble villa in the heart of FiRo. Ruhn let out a breath and\nknocked.\nHe knew better than to barge in.\n\u201cEnter.\u201d The cold male voice leached through the doors, through Ruhn.\nBut he shoved aside any indication of his thundering heart and slid into the\nroom, shutting the door behind him.\nThe Autumn King\u2019s personal study was larger than most single-family\nhouses. Bookshelves rose two stories on every wall, crammed with tomes\nand artifacts both old and new, magic and ordinary. A golden balcony\nbisected the rectangular space, accessible by either of the spiral staircases at\nthe front and back, and heavy black velvet curtains currently blocked the\nmorning light from the tall windows overlooking the interior courtyard of\nthe villa.\nThe orrery in the far back of the space drew Ruhn\u2019s eye: a working\nmodel of their seven planets, moons, and sun. Made from solid gold. Ruhn\nhad been mesmerized by it as a boy, back when he\u2019d been stupid enough to\nbelieve his father actually gave a shit about him, spending hours in here\nwatching the male make whatever observations and calculations he jotted\ndown in his black leather notebooks. He\u2019d asked only once about what his\nfather was looking for, exactly.\nPatterns was all his father said.\nThe Autumn King sat at one of the four massive worktables, each\nlittered with books and an array of glass and metal devices. Experiments for\nwhatever the fuck his father did with those patterns. Ruhn passed one of the\ntables, where iridescent liquid bubbled within a glass orb set over a burner\n\u2014the flame likely of his father\u2019s making\u2014puffs of violet smoke curling\nfrom it.\n\u201cShould I be wearing a hazmat suit?\u201d Ruhn asked, aiming for the\nworktable where his father peered through a foot-long prism ensconced in\nsome delicate silver contraption.\n\u201cState your business, Prince,\u201d his father said shortly, an amber eye\nfixed to the viewing apparatus atop the prism.\nRuhn refrained from commenting about how the taxpaying people of\nthis city would feel if they knew how one of their seven Heads spent his\ndays. The six lower Heads were all appointed by Micah, not elected by any\ndemocratic process. There were councils within councils, designed to give\npeople the illusion of control, but the main order of things was simple: The\nGovernor ruled, and the City Heads led their own districts under him.\nBeyond that, the 33rd Legion answered only to the Governor, while the Aux\nobeyed the City Heads, divided into units based upon districts and species.\nIt grew murkier from there. The wolves claimed the shifter packs were the\ncommanders of the Aux\u2014but the Fae insisted that this distinction belonged\nto them, instead. It made dividing\u2014claiming\u2014responsibilities difficult.\nRuhn had been heading up the Fae division of the Aux for fifteen years\nnow. His father had given the command, and he had obeyed. He had little\nchoice. Good thing he\u2019d trained his entire life to be a lethal, efficient killer.\nNot that it brought him any particular joy.\n\u201cSome major shit is going down,\u201d Ruhn said, halting on the other side\nof the table. \u201cI just got a visit from Isaiah Tiberian. Maximus Tertian was\nmurdered last night\u2014in exactly the same way that Danika and her pack\nwere killed.\u201d\nHis father adjusted some dial on the prism device. \u201cI received the\nreport earlier this morning. It appears Philip Briggs wasn\u2019t the murderer.\u201d\nRuhn stiffened. \u201cYou were going to tell me when?\u201d\nHis father glanced up from the prism device. \u201cAm I beholden to you,\nPrince?\u201d\nThe bastard certainly wasn\u2019t, his title aside. Though they were close in\ndepth of power, the fact remained that Ruhn, despite his Starborn status and\npossession of the Starsword, would always have just a little less than his\nfather. He\u2019d never decided, after he\u2019d gone through his Ordeal and made the\nDrop fifty years ago, whether it was a relief or a curse to have come up\nshort on the power ranking. On the one hand, had he surpassed his father,\nthe playing field would have tipped in his favor. On the other, it would have\nestablished him firmly as a rival.\nHaving seen what his father did to rivals, it was better to not be on that\nlist.\n\u201cThis information is vital. I already put out a call to Flynn and Declan\nto amp up patrols in FiRo. We\u2019ll have every street watched.\u201d\n\u201cThen it does not appear that I needed to tell you, does it?\u201d\nHis father was nearing five hundred years old, had worn the golden\ncrown of the Autumn King for most of that time, and had been an asshole\nfor all of it. And he still showed no signs of aging\u2014not as the Fae did, with\ntheir gradual fading into death, like a shirt washed too many times.\nSo it\u2019d be another few centuries of this. Playing prince. Having to\nknock on a door and wait for permission to enter. Having to kneel and obey.\nRuhn was one of about a dozen Fae Princes across the whole planet\nMidgard\u2014and had met most of the others over the decades. But he stood\napart as the only Starborn among them. Among all the Fae.\nLike Ruhn, the other princes served under preening, vain kings\nstationed in the various territories as Heads of city districts or swaths of\nwilderness. Some of them had been waiting for their thrones for centuries,\ncounting down each decade as if it were mere months.\nIt disgusted him. Always had. Along with the fact that everything he\nhad was bankrolled by the bastard before him: the office above the dive bar,\nthe villa in FiRo adorned with priceless antiques that his father had gifted\nhim upon winning the Starsword during his Ordeal. Ruhn never stayed at\nthe villa, instead choosing to live in a house he shared with his two best\nfriends near the Old Square.\nAlso purchased with his father\u2019s money.\nOfficially, the money came from the \u201csalary\u201d Ruhn received for\nheading up the Fae Auxiliary patrols. But his father\u2019s signature authorized\nthat weekly check.\nThe Autumn King lifted the prism device. \u201cDid the Commander of the\n33rd say anything of note?\u201d\nThe meeting had been one step short of a disaster.\nFirst, Tiberian had grilled him about Bryce\u2019s whereabouts last night,\nuntil Ruhn was about one breath away from beating the shit out of the\nangel, Commander of the 33rd or no. Then Tiberian had the balls to ask\nabout Ruhn\u2019s whereabouts.\nRuhn had refrained from informing the commander that pummeling\nMaximus Tertian for grabbing Bryce\u2019s hand had been tempting.\nShe\u2019d have bitten his head off for it. And she\u2019d been able to handle\nherself, sparing Ruhn the political nightmare of setting off a blood feud\nbetween their two Houses. Not just between Sky and Breath and Flame and\nShadow, but between the Danaans and the Tertians. And thus every Fae and\nvampyr living in Valbara and Pangera. The Fae didn\u2019t fuck around with\ntheir blood feuds. Neither did the vamps.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Ruhn said. \u201cThough Maximus Tertian died a few hours after\nhaving a business meeting with Bryce.\u201d\nHis father set down the prism, his lip curling. \u201cI told you to warn that\ngirl to stay quiet.\u201d\nThat girl. Bryce was always that girl, or the girl, to their father. Ruhn\nhadn\u2019t heard the male speak her name in twelve years. Not since her first\nand last visit to this villa.\nEverything had changed after that visit. Bryce had come here for the\nfirst time, a coltish thirteen-year-old ready to finally meet her father and his\npeople. To meet Ruhn, who had been intrigued at the prospect of finding he\nhad a half sister after more than sixty years of being an only child.\nThe Autumn King had insisted that the visit be discreet\u2014not saying\nthe obvious: until the Oracle whispers of your future. What had gone down\nhad been an unmitigated disaster not only for Bryce, but for Ruhn as well.\nHis chest still ached when he remembered her leaving the villa in tears of\nrage, refusing to look back over her shoulder even once. His father\u2019s\ntreatment of Bryce had opened Ruhn\u2019s eyes to the Autumn King\u2019s true\nnature \u2026 and the cold Fae male before him had never forgotten this fact.\nRuhn had visited Bryce frequently at her parents\u2019 place over the next\nthree years. She\u2019d been a bright spot\u2014the brightest spot, if he felt like\nbeing honest. Until that stupid, shameful fight between them that had left\nthings in such shambles that Bryce still hated his guts. He didn\u2019t blame her\n\u2014not with the words he\u2019d said, that he\u2019d immediately regretted as soon as\nthey\u2019d burst from him.\nNow Ruhn said, \u201cBryce\u2019s meeting with Maximus preceded my warning\nto behave. I arrived right as she was wrapping up.\u201d When he\u2019d gotten that\ncall from Riso Sergatto, the butterfly shifter\u2019s laughing voice unusually\ngrave, he\u2019d sprinted over to the White Raven, not giving himself time to\nsecond-guess the wisdom of it. \u201cI\u2019m her alibi, according to Tiberian\u2014I told\nhim that I walked her home, and stayed there until well after Tertian\u2019s time\nof death.\u201d\nHis father\u2019s face revealed nothing. \u201cAnd yet it still does not seem very\nflattering that the girl was at the club on both nights, and interacted with the\nvictims hours before.\u201d\nRuhn said tightly, \u201cBryce had nothing to do with the murders. Despite\nthe alibi shit, the Governor must believe it, too, because Tiberian swore\nBryce is being guarded by the 33rd.\u201d\nIt might have been admirable that they bothered to do so, had all the\nangels not been arrogant assholes. Luckily, the most arrogant of those\nassholes hadn\u2019t been the one to pay Ruhn this particular visit.\n\u201cThat girl has always possessed a spectacular talent for being where\nshe shouldn\u2019t.\u201d\nRuhn controlled the anger thrumming through him, his shadow magic\nseeking to veil him, shield him from sight. Another reason his father\nresented him: beyond his Starborn gifts, the bulk of his magic skewed\ntoward his mother\u2019s kin\u2014the Fae who ruled Avallen, the mist-shrouded isle\nin the north. The sacred heart of Faedom. His father would have burned\nAvallen into ashes if he could. That Ruhn did not possess his father\u2019s\nflames, the flames of most of the Valbaran Fae, that he instead possessed\nAvallen abilities\u2014more than Ruhn ever let on\u2014to summon and walk\nthrough shadows, had been an unforgivable insult.\nSilence rippled between father and son, interrupted only by the ticking\nmetal of the orrery at the other end of the room as the planets inched around\ntheir orbit.\nHis father picked up the prism, holding it up to the firstlights twinkling\nin one of the three crystal chandeliers.\nRuhn said tightly, \u201cTiberian said the Governor wants these murders\nkept quiet, but I\u2019d like your permission to warn my mother.\u201d Every word\ngrated. I\u2019d like your permission.\nHis father waved a hand. \u201cPermission granted. She\u2019ll heed the\nwarning.\u201d\nJust as Ruhn\u2019s mother had obeyed everyone her entire life.\nShe\u2019d listen and lie low, and no doubt gladly accept the extra guards\nsent to her villa, down the block from his own, until this shit was sorted out.\nMaybe he\u2019d even stay with her tonight.\nShe wasn\u2019t queen\u2014wasn\u2019t even a consort or mate. No, his sweet, kind\nmother had been selected for one purpose: breeding. The Autumn King had\ndecided, after a few centuries of ruling, that he wanted an heir. As the\ndaughter of a prominent noble house that had defected from Avallen\u2019s court,\nshe\u2019d done her duty gladly, grateful for the eternal privilege it offered. In all\nof Ruhn\u2019s seventy-five years of life, he\u2019d never heard her speak one ill word\nabout his father. About the life she\u2019d been conscripted to.\nEven when Ember and his father had their secret, disastrous\nrelationship, his mother had not been jealous. There had been so many other\nfemales before her, and after her. Yet none had been formally chosen, not as\nshe was, to continue the royal bloodline. And when Bryce had come along,\nthe few times his mother had met her, she\u2019d been kind. Doting, even.\nRuhn couldn\u2019t tell if he admired his mother for never questioning the\ngilded cage she lived in. If something was wrong with him for resenting it.\nHe might never understand his mother, yet it didn\u2019t stop his fierce\npride that he took after her bloodline, that his shadow-walking set him apart\nfrom the asshole in front of him, a constant, welcome reminder that he\ndidn\u2019t have to turn into a domineering prick. Even if most of his mother\u2019s\nkin in Avallen were little better. His cousins especially.\n\u201cPerhaps you should call her,\u201d Ruhn said, \u201cgive the warning yourself.\nShe\u2019d appreciate your concern.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m otherwise engaged,\u201d his father said calmly. It had always\nastonished Ruhn: how cold his father was, when those flames burned in his\nveins. \u201cYou may inform her yourself. And you will refrain from telling me\nhow to manage my relationship with your mother.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have a relationship. You bred her like a mare and sent her\nout to pasture.\u201d\nCinders sparked through the room. \u201cYou benefited quite well from that\nbreeding, Starborn.\u201d\nRuhn didn\u2019t dare voice the words that tried to spring from his mouth.\nEven as my stupid fucking title brought you further influence in the empire\nand among your fellow kings, it still chafed, didn\u2019t it? That your son, not\nyou, retrieved the Starsword from the Cave of Princes in Avallen\u2019s dark\nheart. That your son, not you, stood among the long-dead Starborn Princes\nasleep in their sarcophagi and was deemed worthy to pull the sword from\nits sheath. How many times did you try to draw the sword when you were\nyoung? How much research did you do in this very study to find ways to\nwield it without being chosen?\nHis father curled a finger toward him. \u201cI have need of your gift.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d His Starborn abilities were little more than a sparkle of\nstarlight in his palm. His shadow talents were the more interesting gift.\nEven the temperature monitors on the high-tech cameras in this city\ncouldn\u2019t detect him when he shadow-walked.\nHis father held up the prism. \u201cDirect a beam of your starlight through\nthis.\u201d Not waiting for an answer, his father again put an eye to the metal\nviewing contraption atop the prism.\nIt ordinarily took Ruhn a good amount of concentration to summon his\nstarlight, and it usually left him with a headache for hours afterward, but \u2026\nHe was intrigued enough to try.\nSetting his index finger onto the crystal of the prism, Ruhn closed his\neyes and focused upon his breathing. Let the clicking metal of the orrery\nguide him down, down, down into the black pit within himself, past the\nchurning well of his shadows, to the little hollow beneath them. There,\ncurled upon itself like some hibernating creature, lay the single seed of\niridescent light.\nHe gently cupped it with a mental palm, stirring it awake as he\ncarefully brought it upward, as if he were carrying water in his hands. Up\nthrough himself, the power shimmering with anticipation, warm and lovely\nand just about the only part of himself he liked.\nRuhn opened his eyes to find the starlight dancing at his fingertip,\nrefracting through the prism.\nHis father adjusted a few dials on the device, jotting down notes with\nhis other hand.\nThe starlight seed became slippery, disintegrating into the air around\nthem.\n\u201cJust another moment,\u201d the king ordered.\nRuhn gritted his teeth, as if it\u2019d somehow keep the starlight from\ndissolving.\nAnother click of the device, and another jotted note in an ancient, rigid\nhand. The Old Language of the Fae\u2014his father recorded everything in the\nhalf-forgotten language their people had used when they had first come to\nMidgard through the Northern Rift.\nThe starlight shivered, flared, and faded into nothing. The Autumn\nKing grunted in annoyance, but Ruhn barely heard it over his pounding\nhead.\nHe\u2019d mastered himself enough to pay attention as his father finished\nhis notes. \u201cWhat are you even doing with that thing?\u201d\n\u201cStudying how light moves through the world. How it can be shaped.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t we have scientists over at CCU doing this shit?\u201d\n\u201cTheir interests are not the same as mine.\u201d His father surveyed him.\nAnd then said, without a hint of warning, \u201cIt is time to consider females for\nan appropriate marriage.\u201d\nRuhn blinked. \u201cFor you?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t play stupid.\u201d His father shut his notebook and leaned back in\nhis chair. \u201cYou owe it to our bloodline to produce an heir\u2014and to expand\nour alliances. The Oracle decreed you would be a fair and just king. This is\nthe first step in that direction.\u201d\nAll Fae, male and female, made a visit to the city\u2019s Oracle at age\nthirteen as one of the two Great Rites to enter adulthood: first the Oracle,\nand then the Ordeal\u2014a few years or decades later.\nRuhn\u2019s stomach churned at the memory of that first Rite, far worse\nthan his harrowing Ordeal in so many ways. \u201cI\u2019m not getting married.\u201d\n\u201cMarriage is a political contract. Sire an heir, then go back to fucking\nwhomever you please.\u201d\nRuhn snarled. \u201cI am not getting married. Certainly not in an arranged\nmarriage.\u201d\n\u201cYou will do as you are told.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not fucking married.\u201d\n\u201cI did not need the alliance.\u201d\n\u201cBut now we do?\u201d\n\u201cThere is a war raging overseas, in case you weren\u2019t aware. It worsens\nby the day, and it may very well spread here. I do not plan to enter it\nwithout insurance.\u201d\nPulse hammering, Ruhn stared at his father. He was completely\nserious.\nRuhn managed to say, \u201cYou plan to make me marry so we have solid\nallies in the war? Aren\u2019t we the Asteri\u2019s allies?\u201d\n\u201cWe are. But war is a liminal time. Power rankings can easily be\nreshuffled. We must demonstrate how vital and influential we are.\u201d\nRuhn considered the words. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about a marriage to\nsomeone not of the Fae.\u201d His father had to be worried, to even consider\nsomething so rare.\n\u201cQueen Hecuba died last month. Her daughter, Hypaxia, has been\ncrowned the new witch-queen of Valbara.\u201d\nRuhn had seen the news reports. Hypaxia Enador was young, no more\nthan twenty-six. No photos of her existed, as her mother had kept her\ncloistered in her mountain fortress.\nHis father went on, \u201cHer reign will be officially recognized by the\nAsteri at the Summit next month. I will tie her to the Fae soon after that.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re forgetting that Hypaxia will have a say in this. She might very\nwell laugh you off.\u201d\n\u201cMy spies tell me she will heed her mother\u2019s old friendship with us\u2014\nand will be skittish enough as a new ruler to accept the friendly hand we\noffer.\u201d\nRuhn had the distinct feeling of being led into a web, the Autumn King\ndrawing him ever closer to its heart. \u201cI\u2019m not marrying her.\u201d\n\u201cYou are the Crown Prince of the Valbaran Fae. You do not have a\nchoice.\u201d His father\u2019s cold face became so like Bryce\u2019s that Ruhn turned\naway, unable to stomach it. It was a miracle no one had figured out their\nsecret yet. \u201cLuna\u2019s Horn remains at large.\u201d\nRuhn twisted back to his father. \u201cSo? What does one have to do with\nthe other?\u201d\n\u201cI want you to find it.\u201d\nRuhn glanced to the notebooks, the prism. \u201cIt went missing two years\nago.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I now have an interest in locating it. The Horn belonged to the\nFae first. Public interest in retrieving it has waned; now is the right time to\nattain it.\u201d\nHis father tapped a finger on the table. Something had riled him. Ruhn\nconsidered what he\u2019d seen on his father\u2019s schedule this morning when he\u2019d\ndone his cursory scan of it as commander of the Fae Auxiliary. Meetings\nwith preening Fae nobility, a workout with his private guard, and\u2014 \u201cThe\nmeeting with Micah went well this morning, I take it.\u201d\nHis father\u2019s silence confirmed his suspicions. The Autumn King\npinned him with his amber eyes, weighing Ruhn\u2019s stance, his expression, all\nof it. Ruhn knew he\u2019d always come up short, but his father said, \u201cMicah\nwished to discuss shoring up our city\u2019s defenses should the conflict\noverseas spread here. He made it clear the Fae are \u2026 not as they once\nwere.\u201d\nRuhn stiffened. \u201cThe Fae Aux units are in just as good shape as the\nwolves are.\u201d\n\u201cIt is not about our strength of arms, but rather our strength as a\npeople.\u201d His father\u2019s voice dripped with disgust. \u201cThe Fae have long been\nfading\u2014our magic wanes with each generation, like watered-down wine.\u201d\nHe frowned at Ruhn. \u201cThe first Starborn Prince could blind an enemy with\na flash of his starlight. You can barely summon a sparkle for an instant.\u201d\nRuhn clenched his jaw. \u201cThe Governor pushed your buttons. So\nwhat?\u201d\n\u201cHe insulted our strength.\u201d His father\u2019s hair simmered with fire, as if\nthe strands had gone molten. \u201cHe said we gave up the Horn in the first\nplace, then let it be lost two years ago.\u201d\n\u201cIt was stolen from Luna\u2019s Temple. We didn\u2019t fucking lose it.\u201d Ruhn\nbarely knew anything about the object, hadn\u2019t even cared when it went\nmissing two years ago.\n\u201cWe let a sacred artifact of our people be used as a cheap tourist\nattraction,\u201d his father snapped. \u201cAnd I want you to find it again.\u201d So his\nfather could rub it in Micah\u2019s face.\nPetty, brittle male. That\u2019s all his father was.\n\u201cThe Horn has no power,\u201d Ruhn reminded him.\n\u201cIt is a symbol\u2014and symbols will always wield power of their own.\u201d\nHis father\u2019s hair burned brighter.\nRuhn suppressed his urge to cringe, his body tensing with the memory\nof how the king\u2019s burning hand had felt wrapped around his arm, sizzling\nthrough his flesh. No shadows had ever been able to hide him from it. \u201cFind\nthe Horn, Ruhn. If war comes to these shores, our people will need it in\nmore ways than one.\u201d\nHis father\u2019s amber eyes blazed. There was more the male wasn\u2019t\ntelling him.\nRuhn could think of only one other thing to cause this much\naggravation: Micah again suggesting that Ruhn replace his father as City\nHead of FiRo. Whispers had swirled for years, and Ruhn had no doubt the\nArchangel was smart enough to know how much it\u2019d anger the Autumn\nKing. With the Summit nearing, Micah knew pissing off the Fae King with\na reference to his fading power was a good way to ensure the Fae Aux was\nup to snuff before it, regardless of any war.\nRuhn tucked that information aside. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you look for the\nHorn?\u201d\nHis father loosed a breath through his long, thin nose, and the fire in\nhim banked to embers. The king nodded toward Ruhn\u2019s hand, where the\nstarlight had been. \u201cI have been looking. For two years.\u201d Ruhn blinked, but\nhis father went on, \u201cThe Horn was originally the possession of Pelias, the\nfirst Starborn Prince. You may find that like calls to like\u2014merely\nresearching it could reveal things to you that were hidden from others.\u201d\nRuhn hardly bothered to read anything these days beyond the news and\nthe Aux reports. The prospect of poring over ancient tomes just in case\nsomething jumped out at him while a murderer ran loose \u2026 \u201cWe\u2019ll get into\na lot of trouble with the Governor if we take the Horn for ourselves.\u201d\n\u201cThen keep it quiet, Prince.\u201d His father opened his notebook again.\nConversation over.\nYeah, this was nothing more than political ego-stroking. Micah had\ntaunted his father, insulted his strength\u2014and now his father would show\nhim precisely where the Fae stood.\nRuhn ground his teeth. He needed a drink. A strong fucking drink.\nHis head roiled as he headed for the door, the pain from summoning\nthe starlight eddying with every word thrown at him.\nI told you to warn that girl to stay quiet.\nFind the Horn.\nLike calls to like.\nAn appropriate marriage.\nProduce an heir.\nYou owe it to our bloodline.\nRuhn slammed the door behind him. Only when he\u2019d gotten halfway\ndown the hall did he laugh, a harsh, rasping sound. At least the asshole still\ndidn\u2019t know that he\u2019d lied about what the Oracle had told him all those\ndecades ago.\nWith every step out of his father\u2019s villa, Ruhn could once more hear\nthe Oracle\u2019s unearthly whispering, reading the smoke while he\u2019d trembled\nin her dim marble chamber:\nThe royal bloodline shall end with you, Prince."}, "15": {"Name": "PART II THE TRENCH-Chapter 15", "Page Content": " 5 \nSyrinx pawed at the window, his scrunched-up face smooshed against the\nglass. He\u2019d been hissing incessantly for the past ten minutes, and Bryce,\nmore than ready to settle into the plush cushions of the L-shaped couch and\nwatch her favorite Tuesday night reality show, finally twisted to see what all\nthe fuss was about.\nSlightly bigger than a terrier, the chimera huffed and pawed at the\nfloor-to-ceiling glass, the setting sun gilding his wiry golden coat. The long\ntail, tufted with dark fur at the end like a lion\u2019s, waved back and forth. His\nfolded little ears were flat to his round, fuzzy head, his wrinkles of fat and\nthe longer hair at his neck\u2014not quite a mane\u2014were vibrating with his\ngrowling, and his too-big paws, which ended in birdlike talons, were now\u2014\n\u201cStop that! You\u2019re scratching the glass!\u201d\nSyrinx looked over a rounded, muscled shoulder, his squished face\nmore dog than anything, and narrowed his dark eyes. Bryce glared right\nback.\nThe rest of her day had been long and weird and exhausting, especially\nafter she\u2019d gotten a message from Juniper, saying Fury had alerted her\nabout Briggs\u2019s innocence and the new murder, and warning Bryce to be\ncareful. She doubted either friend knew of her involvement in finding the\nmurderer, or of the angel who\u2019d been assigned to work with her, but it had\nstung\u2014just a bit. That Fury hadn\u2019t bothered to contact her personally. That\neven June had done it over messaging and not face-to-face.\nBryce had a feeling tomorrow would be just as draining\u2014if not worse.\nSo throwing in a battle of wills with a thirty-pound chimera wasn\u2019t her\ndefinition of a much-needed unwinding.\n\u201cYou just got a walk,\u201d she reminded Syrinx. \u201cAnd an extra helping of\ndinner.\u201d\nSyrinx gave a hmmph and scratched the window again.\n\u201cBad!\u201d she hissed. Half-heartedly, sure, but she tried to sound\nauthoritative.\nWhere the little beast was concerned, dominance was a quality they\nboth pretended she had.\nGroaning, Bryce hauled herself from the nest of cushions and padded\nacross wood and carpet to the window. On the street below, cars inched\npast, a few late commuters trudged home, and some dinner patrons strolled\narm-in-arm to one of the fine restaurants along the river at the end of the\nblock. Above them, the setting sun smeared the sky red and gold and pink,\nthe palm trees and cypresses swayed in the balmy spring breeze, and \u2026\nAnd that was a winged male sitting on the opposite roof. Staring right at\nher.\nShe knew those gray wings, and the dark, shoulder-length hair, and the\ncut of those broad shoulders.\nProtection duty, Micah had said.\nBullshit. She had a strong feeling the Governor still didn\u2019t trust her,\nalibi or no.\nBryce gave Hunt Athalar a dazzling smile and slashed the heavy\ncurtains shut.\nSyrinx yowled as he was caught in them, reversing his stout little body\nout of the folds. His tail lashed from side to side, and she braced her hands\non her hips. \u201cYou were enjoying the sight?\u201d\nSyrinx showed all his pointy teeth as he let out another yowl, trotted to\nthe couch, and threw himself onto the warmed cushions where she\u2019d been\nsitting. The portrait of despair.\nA moment later, her phone buzzed on the coffee table. Right as her\nshow began.\nShe didn\u2019t know the number, but she wasn\u2019t at all surprised when she\npicked up, plopping down onto the cushions, and Hunt growled, \u201cOpen the\ncurtains. I want to watch the show.\u201d\nShe propped both bare feet on the table. \u201cI didn\u2019t know angels deigned\nto watch trash TV.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d rather watch the sunball game that\u2019s on right now, but I\u2019ll take\nwhat I can get.\u201d\nThe idea of the Umbra Mortis watching a dating competition was\nlaughable enough that Bryce hit pause on the live show. At least she could\nnow speed through commercials. \u201cWhat are you doing on that roof,\nAthalar?\u201d\n\u201cWhat I was ordered to do.\u201d\nGods spare her. \u201cProtecting me doesn\u2019t entitle you to invade my\nprivacy.\u201d She could admit to the wisdom in letting him guard her, but she\ndidn\u2019t have to yield all sense of boundaries.\n\u201cOther people would disagree.\u201d She opened her mouth, but he cut her\noff. \u201cI\u2019ve got my orders. I can\u2019t disobey them.\u201d\nHer stomach tightened. No, Hunt Athalar certainly could not disobey\nhis orders.\nNo slave could, whether Vanir or human. So she instead asked, \u201cAnd\nhow, exactly, did you get this number?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s in your file.\u201d\nShe tapped her foot on the table. \u201cDid you pay Prince Ruhn a visit?\u201d\nShe would have handed over a gold mark to watch her brother go head-to-\nhead with Micah\u2019s personal assassin.\nHunt grunted, \u201cIsaiah did.\u201d She smiled. \u201cIt was standard protocol.\u201d\n\u201cSo even after your boss tasked me with finding this murderer, you felt\nthe need to look into whether my alibi checked out?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t write the fucking rules, Quinlan.\u201d\n\u201cHmm.\u201d\n\u201cOpen the curtains.\u201d\n\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d\n\u201cOr you could invite me in and make my job easier.\u201d\n\u201cDefinitely no.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cBecause you can do your job just as well from that roof.\u201d\nHunt\u2019s chuckle skittered along her bones. \u201cWe\u2019ve been ordered to get\nto the bottom of these murders. So I hate to tell you this, sweetheart, but\nwe\u2019re about to get real up close and personal.\u201d\nThe way he said sweetheart\u2014full of demeaning, condescending\nswagger\u2014made her grind her teeth.\nBryce rose, padding to the floor-to-ceiling window under Syrinx\u2019s\ncareful watch, and tugged the curtains back enough to see the angel\nstanding on the opposite roof, phone to his ear, gray wings slightly flared,\nas if balancing against the wind. \u201cI\u2019m sure you get off on the whole\nprotector-of-damsels thing, but I was asked to head this case. You\u2019re the\nbackup.\u201d\nEven from across the street, she could see him roll his eyes. \u201cCan we\nskip this pecking-order bullshit?\u201d\nSyrinx nudged at her calves, then shoved his face past her legs to peer\nat the angel.\n\u201cWhat is that pet of yours?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s a chimera.\u201d\n\u201cLooks expensive.\u201d\n\u201cHe was.\u201d\n\u201cYour apartment looks pretty damn expensive, too. That sorceress\nmust pay you well.\u201d\n\u201cShe does.\u201d Truth and lie.\nHis wings flared. \u201cYou have my number now. Call it if something goes\nwrong, or feels wrong, or if you need anything.\u201d\n\u201cLike a pizza?\u201d\nShe clearly saw the middle finger Hunt lifted above his head. Shadow\nof Death, indeed.\nBryce purred, \u201cYou would make a good delivery boy with those\nwings.\u201d Angels in Lunathion never stooped to such work, though. Ever.\n\u201cKeep the damn curtains open, Quinlan.\u201d He hung up.\nShe just gave him a mocking wave. And shut the curtains entirely.\nHer phone buzzed with a message just as she plopped down again.\nDo you have enchantments guarding your apartment?\nShe rolled her eyes, typing back, Do I look stupid?\nHunt fired back, Some shit is going down in this city and you\u2019ve been\ngifted with grade A protection against it\u2014yet you\u2019re busting my balls about\nboundaries. I think that\u2019s answer enough regarding your intelligence.\nHer thumbs flew over the screen as she scowled and wrote, Kindly fly\nthe fuck off.\nShe hit send before she could debate the wisdom of saying that to the\nUmbra Mortis.\nHe didn\u2019t reply. With a smug smile, she picked up her remote.\nA thud against the window had her leaping out of her skin, sending\nSyrinx scrambling in a mad dash toward the curtains, yowling his fuzzy\nhead off.\nShe stormed around the couch, whipping the curtains back, wondering\nwhat the fuck he\u2019d thrown at her window\u2014\nThe Fallen angel hovered right there. Glaring at her.\nShe refused to back away, even as her heart thundered. Refused to do\nanything but shove open the window, the wind off his mighty wings stirring\nher hair. \u201cWhat?\u201d\nHis dark eyes didn\u2019t so much as blink. Striking\u2014that was the only\nword Bryce could think of to describe his handsome face, full of powerful\nlines and sharp cheekbones. \u201cYou can make this investigation easy, or you\ncan make it hard.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSpare me.\u201d Hunt\u2019s dark hair shifted in the wind. The rustle and beat\nof his wings overpowered the traffic below\u2014and the humans and Vanir\nnow gawking up at him. \u201cYou don\u2019t appreciate being watched, or coddled,\nor whatever.\u201d He crossed his muscled arms. \u201cNeither of us gets a say in this\narrangement. So rather than waste your breath arguing about boundaries,\nwhy don\u2019t you make that list of suspects and Danika\u2019s movements?\u201d\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you stop telling me what I should be doing with my\ntime?\u201d\nShe could have sworn she tasted ether as he growled, \u201cI\u2019m going to be\nstraight with you.\u201d\n\u201cGoody.\u201d\nHis nostrils flared. \u201cI will do whatever the Hel it takes to solve this\ncase. Even if it means tying you to a fucking chair until you write those\nlists.\u201d\nShe smirked. \u201cBondage. Nice.\u201d\nHunt\u2019s eyes darkened. \u201cDo. Not. Fuck. With. Me.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah, you\u2019re the Umbra Mortis.\u201d\nHis teeth flashed. \u201cI don\u2019t care what you call me, Quinlan, so long as\nyou do what you\u2019re told.\u201d\nFucking alphahole.\n\u201cImmortality is a long time to have a giant stick up your ass.\u201d Bryce\nput her hands on her hips. Never mind that she was completely undermined\nby Syrinx dancing at her feet, prancing in place.\nDragging his stare away from her, the angel surveyed her pet with\nraised brows. Syrinx\u2019s tail waved and bobbed. Hunt snorted, as if despite\nhimself. \u201cYou\u2019re a smart beastie, aren\u2019t you?\u201d He threw a scornful glance to\nBryce. \u201cSmarter than your owner, it seems.\u201d\nMake that the King of Alphaholes.\nBut Syrinx preened. And Bryce had the stupid, overwhelming urge to\nhide Syrinx from Hunt, from anyone, from anything. He was hers, and no\none else\u2019s, and she didn\u2019t particularly like the thought of anyone coming\ninto their little bubble\u2014\nHunt\u2019s stare lifted to her own again. \u201cDo you own any weapons?\u201d The\npurely male gleam in his eye told her that he assumed she didn\u2019t.\n\u201cBother me again,\u201d she said sweetly, just before she shut the window\nin his face, \u201cand you\u2019ll find out.\u201d\nHunt wondered how much trouble he\u2019d get in if he chucked Bryce Quinlan\ninto the Istros.\nAfter the morning he\u2019d had, any punishment from Micah or being\nturned into a pig by Jesiba Roga was starting to seem well worth it.\nLeaning against a lamppost, his face coated with the misting rain that\ndrifted through the city, Hunt clenched his jaw hard enough to hurt. At this\nhour, commuters packed the narrow streets of the Old Square\u2014some\nheading to jobs in the countless shops and galleries, others aiming for the\nspires of the CBD, half a mile westward. All of them, however, noted his\nwings, his face, and gave him a wide berth.\nHunt ignored them and glanced at the clock on his phone. Eight\nfifteen.\nHe\u2019d waited long enough to make the call. He dialed the number and\nheld the phone to his ear, listening to it ring once, twice\u2014\n\u201cPlease tell me Bryce is alive,\u201d said Isaiah, his voice breathless in a\nway that told Hunt he was either at the barracks gym or enjoying his\nboyfriend\u2019s company.\n\u201cFor the moment.\u201d\nA machine beeped, like Isaiah was dialing down the speed of a\ntreadmill. \u201cDo I want to know why I\u2019m getting a call this soon?\u201d A pause.\n\u201cWhy are you on Samson Street?\u201d\nThough Isaiah probably tracked his location through the beacon on\nHunt\u2019s phone, Hunt still scowled toward the nearest visible camera. There\nwere likely ones hidden in the cypresses and palm trees flanking the\nsidewalks, too, or disguised as sprinkler heads popping from the soggy\ngrass of the flower beds, or built into the iron lampposts like the one he\nleaned against.\nSomeone was always watching. In this entire fucking city, territory,\nand world, someone was always watching, the cameras so bespelled and\nwarded that they were bombproof. Even if this city turned to rubble under\nthe lethal magic of the Asterian Guard\u2019s brimstone missiles, the cameras\nwould keep recording.\n\u201cAre you aware,\u201d Hunt said, his voice a low rasp as a bevy of quails\nsnaked across the street\u2014some tiny shifter family, no doubt\u2014\u201cthat\nchimeras are able to pick locks, open doors, and jump between two places\nas if they were walking from one room to another?\u201d\n\u201cNo \u2026?\u201d Isaiah said, panting.\nApparently, Quinlan wasn\u2019t, either, if she bothered to have a crate for\nher beast. Though maybe the damn thing was more to give the chimera a\ndesignated comfort space, like people did with their dogs. Since there was\nno way he would stay contained without a whole host of enchantments.\nThe Lowers, the class of Vanir to which the chimera belonged, had all\nsorts of interesting, small powers like that. It was part of why they\ndemanded such high prices on the market. And why, even millennia later,\nthe Senate and Asteri had shot down any attempts to change the laws that\nbranded them as property to be traded. The Lowers were too dangerous,\nthey\u2019d claimed\u2014unable to understand the laws, with powers that could be\ndisruptive if left unchecked by the various spells and magic-infused tattoos\nthat held them.\nAnd too lucrative, especially for the ruling powers whose families\nprofited from their trade.\nSo they remained Lowers.\nHunt tucked his wings in one at a time. Water beaded off the gray\nfeathers like clear jewels. \u201cThis is already a nightmare.\u201d\nIsaiah coughed. \u201cYou watched Quinlan for one night.\u201d\n\u201cTen hours, to be exact. Right until her pet chimera just appeared next\nto me at dawn, bit me in the ass for looking like I was dozing off, and then\nvanished again\u2014right back into the apartment. Just as Quinlan came out of\nher bedroom and opened the curtains to see me grabbing my own ass like a\nfucking idiot. Do you know how sharp a chimera\u2019s teeth are?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Hunt could have sworn he heard a smile in Isaiah\u2019s voice.\n\u201cWhen I flew over to explain, she blasted her music and ignored me\nlike a fucking brat.\u201d With enough enchantments around her apartment to\nkeep out a host of angels, Hunt hadn\u2019t even tried to get in through a\nwindow, since he\u2019d tested them all overnight. So he\u2019d been forced to glower\nthrough the glass\u2014returning to the roof only after she\u2019d emerged from her\nbedroom in nothing but a black sports bra and thong. Her smirk at his\nbacktracking wings had been nothing short of feline. \u201cI didn\u2019t see her again\nuntil she went for a run. She flipped me off as she left.\u201d\n\u201cSo you went to Samson Street to brood? What\u2019s the emergency?\u201d\n\u201cThe emergency, asshole, is that I might kill her before we find the real\nmurderer.\u201d He had too much riding on this case.\n\u201cYou\u2019re just pissed she\u2019s not cowering or fawning.\u201d\n\u201cLike I fucking want anyone to fawn\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Quinlan now?\u201d\n\u201cGetting her nails done.\u201d\nIsaiah\u2019s pause sounded a Hel of a lot like he was about to burst out\nlaughing. \u201cHence your presence on Samson Street before nine.\u201d\n\u201cGazing through the window of a nail salon like a gods-damned\nstalker.\u201d\nThe fact that Quinlan wasn\u2019t gunning for the murderer grated as much\nas her behavior. And Hunt couldn\u2019t help being suspicious. He didn\u2019t know\nhow or why she might have killed Danika, her pack, and Tertian, but she\u2019d\nbeen connected to all of them. Had gone to the same place on the nights\nthey\u2019d been murdered. She knew something\u2014or had done something.\n\u201cI\u2019m hanging up now.\u201d The bastard was smiling. Hunt knew it.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve faced down enemy armies, survived Sandriel\u2019s arena, gone toe-to-\ntoe with Archangels.\u201d Isaiah chuckled. \u201cSurely a party girl isn\u2019t as difficult\nas all that.\u201d The line cut off.\nHunt ground his teeth. Through the glass window of the salon, he\ncould perfectly make out Bryce seated at one of the marble workstations,\nhands outstretched to a pretty reddish-gold-scaled draki female who was\nputting yet another coat of polish on her nails. How many did she need?\nAt this hour, only a few other patrons were seated inside, nails or\ntalons or claws in the process of being filed and painted and whatever the\nHel they did to them in there. But all of them kept glancing through the\nwindow. To him.\nHe\u2019d already earned a glare from the teal-haired falcon shifter at the\nwelcome counter, but she hadn\u2019t dared come out to ask him to stop making\nher clients nervous and leave.\nBryce sat there, wholly ignoring him. Chatting and laughing with the\nfemale doing her nails.\nIt had taken Hunt a matter of moments to launch into the skies when\nBryce had left her apartment. He\u2019d trailed overhead, well aware of the\nmorning commuters who would film him if he landed beside her in the\nmiddle of the street and wrapped his hands around her throat.\nHer run took her fifteen blocks away, apparently. She had barely\nbroken a sweat by the time she jogged up to the nail salon, her skintight\nathletic clothes damp with the misting rain, and threw him a look that\nwarned him to stay outside.\nThat had been an hour ago. A full hour of drills and files and scissors\nbeing applied to her nails in a way that would make the Hind herself cringe.\nPure torture.\nFive minutes. Quinlan had five more fucking minutes, then he\u2019d drag\nher out. Micah must have lost his mind\u2014that was the only explanation for\nasking her to help, especially if she prioritized her nails over solving her\nfriends\u2019 murder.\nHe didn\u2019t know why it came as a surprise. After all he\u2019d seen,\neveryone he\u2019d met and endured, this sort of shit should have ceased to\nbother him long ago.\nSomeone with Quinlan\u2019s looks would become accustomed to the doors\nthat face and body of hers opened without so much as a squeak of protest.\nBeing half-human had some disadvantages, yes\u2014a lot of them, if he was\nbeing honest about the state of the world. But she\u2019d done well. Really\nfucking well, if that apartment was any indication.\nThe draki female set aside the bottle and flicked her claw-tipped\nfingers over Bryce\u2019s nails. Magic sparked, Bryce\u2019s ponytail shifting as if a\ndry wind had blown by.\nLike that of the Valbaran Fae, draki magic skewed toward flame and\nwind. In the northern climes of Pangera, though, he\u2019d met draki and Fae\nwhose power could summon water, rain, mist\u2014element-based magic. But\neven among the reclusive draki and the Fae, no one bore lightning. He\nknew, because he\u2019d looked\u2014desperate in his youth for anyone who might\nteach him how to control it. He\u2019d had to teach himself in the end.\nBryce examined her nails, and smiled. And then hugged the female.\nFucking hugged her. Like she was some sort of gods-damned war hero for\nthe job she\u2019d done.\nHunt was surprised his teeth weren\u2019t ground to stumps by the time she\nheaded for the door, waving goodbye to the smiling falcon shifter at the\nfront desk, who handed her a clear umbrella, presumably to borrow against\nthe rain.\nThe glass door opened, and Bryce\u2019s eyes at last met Hunt\u2019s.\n\u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\u201d The words exploded out of him.\nShe popped open the umbrella, nearly taking out his eye. \u201cDid you\nhave something better to do with your time?\u201d\n\u201cYou made me wait in the rain.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a big, tough male. I think you can handle a little water.\u201d\nHunt fell into step beside her. \u201cI told you to make those two lists. Not\ngo to a motherfucking beauty salon.\u201d\nShe paused at an intersection, waiting for the bumper-to-bumper cars\nto crawl past, and straightened to her full height. Not anywhere close to his,\nbut she somehow managed to look down her nose at him while still looking\nup at him. \u201cIf you\u2019re so good at investigating, why don\u2019t you look into it\nand spare me the effort?\u201d\n\u201cYou were given an order by the Governor.\u201d The words sounded\nridiculous even to him. She crossed the street, and he followed. \u201cAnd I\u2019d\nthink you\u2019d be personally motivated to figure out who\u2019s behind this.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t assume anything about my motivations.\u201d She dodged around a\npuddle of either rain or piss. In the Old Square, it was impossible to tell.\nHe refrained from pushing her into that puddle. \u201cDo you have a\nproblem with me?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t really care about you enough to have a problem with you.\u201d\n\u201cLikewise.\u201d\nHer eyes really did glow then, as if a distant fire simmered within. She\nsurveyed him, sizing up every inch and somehow\u2014some-fucking-how\u2014\nmaking him feel about three inches tall.\nHe said nothing until they turned down her street at last. He growled,\n\u201cYou need to make the list of suspects and the list of Danika\u2019s last week of\nactivities.\u201d\nShe examined her nails, now painted in some sort of color gradient that\nwent from pink to periwinkle tips. Like the sky at twilight. \u201cNo one likes a\nnag, Athalar.\u201d\nThey reached the arched glass entry of her apartment building\u2014\nstructured like a fish\u2019s fin, he\u2019d realized last night\u2014and the doors slid open.\nPonytail swishing, she said cheerfully, \u201cBye.\u201d\nHunt drawled, \u201cPeople might see you dicking around like this,\nQuinlan, and think you were trying to hinder an official investigation.\u201d If he\ncouldn\u2019t bully her into working on this case, maybe he could scare her into\nit.\nEspecially with the truth: She wasn\u2019t off the hook. Not even close.\nHer eyes flared again, and damn if it wasn\u2019t satisfying. So Hunt just\nadded, mouth curving into a half smile, \u201cBetter hurry. You wouldn\u2019t want to\nbe late for work.\u201d\nGoing to the nail salon had been worth it on so many levels, but perhaps the\nbiggest benefit had been pissing off Athalar.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see why you can\u2019t let the angel in,\u201d moped Lehabah, perched\natop an old pillar candle. \u201cHe\u2019s so handsome.\u201d\nIn the bowels of the gallery library, client paperwork spread on the\ntable before her, Bryce cast a sidelong glare at the female-shaped flame.\n\u201cDo not drip wax on these documents, Lele.\u201d\nThe fire sprite grumbled, and plopped her ass on the candle\u2019s wick\nanyway. Wax dribbled down the sides, her tangle of yellow hair floating\nabove her head\u2014as if she were indeed a flame given a plump female shape.\n\u201cHe\u2019s just sitting on the roof in the dreary weather. Let him rest on the\ncouch down here. Syrinx says the angel can brush his coat if he needs\nsomething to do.\u201d\nBryce sighed at the painted ceiling\u2014the night sky rendered in loving\ncare. The giant gold chandelier that hung down the center of the space was\nfashioned after an exploding sun, with all the other dangling lights in\nperfect alignment of the seven planets. \u201cThe angel,\u201d she said, frowning\ntoward Syrinx\u2019s slumbering form on the green velvet couch, \u201cis not allowed\nin here.\u201d\nLehabah let out a sad little noise. \u201cOne day, the boss will trade my\nservices to some lecherous old creep, and you\u2019ll regret ever denying me\nanything.\u201d\n\u201cOne day, that lecherous old creep will actually make you do your job\nand guard his books, and you\u2019ll regret spending all these hours of relative\nfreedom moping.\u201d\nWax sizzled on the table. Bryce whipped her head up.\nLehabah was sprawled belly-down on the candle, an idle hand hanging\noff the side. Dangerously near the documents Bryce had spent the past three\nhours poring over.\n\u201cDo not.\u201d\nLehabah rotated her arm so that the tattoo inked amid the simmering\nflesh was visible. It had been stamped on her arm within moments of her\nbirth, Lehabah had said. SPQM. It was inked on the flesh of every sprite\u2014\nfire or water or earth, it didn\u2019t matter. Punishment for joining the angels\u2019\nrebellion two hundred years ago, when the sprites had dared protest their\nstatus as peregrini. As Lowers. The Asteri had gone even further than their\nenslavement and torture of the angels. They\u2019d decreed after the rebellion\nthat every sprite\u2014not only the ones who\u2019d joined Shahar and her legion\u2014\nwould be enslaved, and cast from the House of Sky and Breath. All of their\ndescendants would be wanderers and slaves, too. Forever.\nIt was one of the more spectacularly fucked episodes of the Republic\u2019s\nhistory.\nLehabah sighed. \u201cBuy my freedom from Jesiba. Then I can go live at\nyour apartment and keep your baths and all your food warm.\u201d\nShe could do far more than that, Bryce knew. Technically, Lehabah\u2019s\nmagic outranked Bryce\u2019s own. But most non-humans could claim the same.\nAnd even while it was greater than Bryce\u2019s, Lehabah\u2019s power was still an\nember compared to the Fae\u2019s flames. Her father\u2019s flames.\nBryce set down the client\u2019s purchase papers. \u201cIt\u2019s not that easy, Lele.\u201d\n\u201cSyrinx told me you\u2019re lonely. I could cheer you up.\u201d\nIn answer, the chimera rolled onto his back, tongue dangling from his\nmouth, and snored.\n\u201cOne, my building doesn\u2019t allow fire sprites. Or water sprites. It\u2019s an\ninsurance nightmare. Two, it\u2019s not as simple as asking Jesiba. She might\nvery well get rid of you because I ask.\u201d\nLehabah cupped her round chin in her hand and dripped another\nfreckle of wax dangerously close to the paperwork. \u201cShe gave you Syrie.\u201d\nCthona give her patience. \u201cShe let me buy Syrinx because my life was\nfucked up, and I lost it when she got bored with him and tried to sell him\noff.\u201d\nThe fire sprite said quietly, \u201cBecause Danika died.\u201d\nBryce closed her eyes for a second, then said, \u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t curse so much, BB.\u201d\n\u201cThen you really won\u2019t like the angel.\u201d\n\u201cHe led my people into battle\u2014and he\u2019s a member of my House. I\ndeserve to meet him.\u201d\n\u201cLast I checked, that battle went rather poorly, and the fire sprites were\nkicked out of Sky and Breath thanks to it.\u201d\nLehabah sat up, legs crossed. \u201cMembership in the Houses is not\nsomething a government can decree. Our expulsion was in name only.\u201d\nIt was true. But Bryce still said, \u201cWhat the Asteri and their Senate say\ngoes.\u201d\nLehabah had been guardian of the gallery\u2019s library for decades. Logic\ninsisted that ordering a fire sprite to watch over a library was a poor idea,\nbut when a third of the books in the place would like nothing more than to\nescape, kill someone, or eat them\u2014in varying orders\u2014having a living\nflame keeping them in line was worth any risk. Even the endless chatter, it\nseemed.\nSomething thumped on the mezzanine. As if a book had dived off the\nshelf of its own accord.\nLehabah hissed toward it, turning a deep blue. Paper and leather\nwhispered as the errant book found its place once again.\nBryce smiled, and then the office phone rang. One glance at the screen\nhad her reaching for the phone and hissing at the sprite, \u201cBack on your\nperch now.\u201d\nLehabah had just reached the glass dome where she maintained her\nfiery vigil over the library\u2019s wandering books when Bryce answered.\n\u201cAfternoon, boss.\u201d\n\u201cAny progress?\u201d\n\u201cStill investigating. How\u2019s Pangera?\u201d\nJesiba didn\u2019t bother answering, instead saying, \u201cI\u2019ve got a client\ncoming in at two o\u2019clock. Be ready. And stop letting Lehabah prattle. She\nhas a job to do.\u201d The line went dead.\nBryce rose from the desk where she\u2019d been working all morning. The\noak panels of the library beneath the gallery looked old, but they were\nwired with the latest tech and best enchantments money could buy. Not to\nmention, there was a killer sound system that she often put to good use\nwhen Jesiba was on the other side of the Haldren.\nNot that she danced down here\u2014not anymore. Nowadays, the music\nwas mostly to keep the thrumming of the firstlights from driving her insane.\nOr for drowning out Lehabah\u2019s monologues.\nBookshelves lined every wall, interrupted only by a dozen or so small\ntanks and terrariums, occupied by all manner of small common animals:\nlizards and snakes and turtles and various rodents. Bryce often wondered if\nthey were all people who\u2019d pissed off Jesiba. None showed any sign of\nawareness, which was even more horrifying if it was true. They\u2019d not only\nbeen turned into animals, but had also forgotten they were something else\nentirely.\nNaturally, Lehabah had named all of them, each one more ridiculous\nthan the last. Nutmeg and Ginger were the names of the geckos in the tank\nclosest to Bryce. Sisters, Lehabah claimed. Miss Poppy was the name of the\nblack-and-white snake on the mezzanine.\nLehabah never named anything in the biggest tank, though. The\nmassive one that occupied an entire wall of the library, and whose glass\nexpanse revealed a watery gloom. Mercifully, the tank was currently empty.\nLast year, Bryce lobbied on Lehabah\u2019s behalf for a few iris eels to\nbrighten the murky blue with their shimmering rainbow light. Jesiba had\nsaid no, and instead bought a pet kelpie that had humped the glass with all\nthe finesse of a wasted college guy.\nBryce had made sure that motherfucker was given to a client as a gift\nreally quickly.\nBryce braced herself for the work before her. Not the paperwork or the\nclient\u2014but what she had to do tonight. Gods fucking help her when Athalar\ngot wind of it.\nBut the thought of his face when he realized what she had planned \u2026\nYeah, it\u2019d be satisfying.\nIf she survived."}, "16": {"Name": "PART II THE TRENCH-Chapter 16", "Page Content": " 6 \nThe mirthroot Ruhn had smoked ten minutes ago with Flynn might have\nbeen more potent than his friend had let on.\nLying on his bed, specially shaped Fae headphones over his arched\nears, Ruhn closed his eyes and let the thumping bass and sizzling, soaring\nsynthesizer of the music send him drifting.\nHis booted foot tapped in time to the steady beat, the drumming\nfingers he\u2019d interlaced over his stomach echoing each flutter of notes high,\nhigh above. Every breath pulled him further back from consciousness, as if\nhis very mind had been yanked a good few feet away from where it\nnormally rested like a captain at the helm of a ship.\nHeavy relaxation melted him, bone and blood morphing to liquid gold.\nEach note sent it rippling through him. Every stressor and sharp word and\naggravation leaked from him, slithered off the bed like a snake.\nHe flipped off those feelings as they slid away. He was well aware that\nhe\u2019d taken the hits of Flynn\u2019s mirthroot thanks to the hours he\u2019d spent\nbrooding over his father\u2019s bullshit orders.\nHis father could go to Hel.\nThe mirthroot wrapped soft, sweet arms around his mind and dragged\nhim into its shimmering pool.\nRuhn let himself drown in it, too mellow to do anything but let the\nmusic wash over him, his body sinking into the mattress, until he was\nfalling through shadows and starlight. The strings of the song hovered\noverhead, golden threads that glittered with sound. Was he still moving his\nbody? His eyelids were too heavy to lift to check.\nA scent like lilac and nutmeg filled the room. Female, Fae \u2026\nIf one of the females partying downstairs had shown herself into his\nroom, thinking she\u2019d get a nice, sweaty ride with a Prince of the Fae, she\u2019d\nbe sorely disappointed. He was in no shape for fucking right now. At least\nnot any fucking that would be worthwhile.\nHis eyelids were so incredibly heavy. He should open them. Where the\nHel were the controls to his body? Even his shadows had drifted away, too\nfar to summon.\nThe scent grew stronger. He knew that scent. Knew it as well as\u2014\nRuhn jerked upward, eyes flying open to find his sister standing at the\nfoot of his bed.\nBryce\u2019s mouth was moving, whiskey-colored eyes full of dry\namusement, but he couldn\u2019t hear a word she said, not a word\u2014\nOh. Right. The headphones. Blasting music.\nBlinking furiously, gritting his teeth against the drug trying to haul him\nback down, down, down, Ruhn removed the headphones and hit pause on\nhis phone. \u201cWhat?\u201d\nBryce leaned against his chipped wood dresser. At least she was in\nnormal clothes for once. Even if the jeans were painted on and the cream-\ncolored sweater left little to the imagination. \u201cI said, you\u2019ll blow out your\neardrums listening to music that loud.\u201d\nRuhn\u2019s head spun as he narrowed his eyes at her, blinking at the halo\nof starlight that danced around her head, at her feet. He blinked again,\npushing past the auras clouding his vision, and it was gone. Another blink,\nand it was there.\nBryce snorted. \u201cYou\u2019re not hallucinating. I\u2019m standing here.\u201d\nHis mouth was a thousand miles away, but he managed to ask, \u201cWho\nlet you in?\u201d Declan and Flynn were downstairs, along with half a dozen of\ntheir top Fae warriors. A few of them people he didn\u2019t want within a block\nof his sister.\nBryce ignored his question, frowning toward the corner of his room.\nToward the pile of unwashed laundry and the Starsword he\u2019d chucked atop\nit. The sword glimmered with starlight, too. He could have sworn the damn\nthing was singing. Ruhn shook his head, as if it\u2019d clear out his ears, as\nBryce said, \u201cI need to talk to you.\u201d\nThe last time Bryce had been in this room, she\u2019d been sixteen and he\u2019d\nspent hours beforehand cleaning it\u2014and the whole house. Every bong and\nbottle of liquor, every pair of female underwear that had never been\nreturned to its owner, every trace and scent of sex and drugs and all the\nstupid shit they did here had been hidden.\nAnd she\u2019d stood right there, during that last visit. Stood there as they\nscreamed at each other.\nThen and now blurred, Bryce\u2019s form shrinking and expanding, her\nadult face blending into teenage softness, the light in her amber eyes\nwarming and cooling, his vision surrounding the scene glinting with\nstarlight, starlight, starlight.\n\u201cFucking Hel,\u201d Bryce muttered, and aimed for the door. \u201cYou\u2019re\npathetic.\u201d\nHe managed to say, \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\n\u201cTo get you water.\u201d She flung the door open. \u201cI can\u2019t talk to you like\nthis.\u201d\nIt occurred to him then that this had to be important if she was not only\nhere, but eager to get him to focus. And that there might still be a chance he\nwas hallucinating, but he wasn\u2019t going to let her venture into the warren of\nsin unaccompanied.\nOn legs that felt ten miles long, feet that weighed a thousand pounds,\nhe staggered after her. The dim hallway hid most of the various stains on\nthe white paint\u2014all thanks to the various parties he and his friends had\nthrown in fifty years of being roommates. Well, they\u2019d had this house for\ntwenty years\u2014and had only moved because their first one had literally\nstarted to fall apart. This house might not last another two years, if he was\nbeing honest.\nBryce was halfway down the curving grand staircase, the firstlights of\nthe crystal chandelier bouncing off her red hair in that shimmering halo.\nHow had he not noticed the chandelier was hanging askew? Must be from\nwhen Declan had leapt off the stair railing onto it, swinging around and\nswigging from his bottle of whiskey. He\u2019d fallen off a moment later, too\ndrunk to hold on.\nIf the Autumn King knew the shit they did in this house, there was no\nway he or any other City Head would allow them to lead the Fae Aux\ndivision. No way Micah would ever tap him to take his father\u2019s place on\nthat council.\nBut getting wasted was for off-nights only. Never when on duty or on\ncall.\nBryce hit the worn oak floor of the first level, edging around the beer\npong table occupying most of the foyer. A few cups littered its stained\nplywood surface, painted by Flynn with what they\u2019d all deemed was high-\nclass art: an enormous Fae male head devouring an angel whole, only\nfrayed wings visible through the snapped-shut teeth. It seemed to ripple\nwith movement as Ruhn cleared the stairs. He could have sworn the\npainting winked at him.\nYeah, water. He needed water.\nBryce showed herself through the living room, where the music\nblasted so loud it made Ruhn\u2019s teeth rattle in his skull.\nHe entered in time to see Bryce striding past the pool table in the rear\nof the long, cavernous space. A few Aux warriors stood around it, females\nwith them, deep in a game.\nTristan Flynn, son of Lord Hawthorne, presided over it from a nearby\narmchair, a pretty dryad on his lap. The glazed light in his brown eyes\nmirrored Ruhn\u2019s own. Flynn gave Bryce a crooked grin as she approached.\nAll it usually took was one look and females crawled into Tristan Flynn\u2019s\nlap just like the tree nymph, or\u2014if the look was more of a glower\u2014any\nenemies outright bolted.\nCharming as all Hel and lethal as fuck. It should have been the Flynn\nfamily motto.\nBryce didn\u2019t stop as she passed him, unfazed by his classic Fae beauty\nand considerable muscles, but demanded over her shoulder, \u201cWhat the fuck\ndid you give him?\u201d\nFlynn leaned forward, prying his short chestnut hair free from the\ndryad\u2019s long fingers. \u201cHow do you know it was me?\u201d\nBryce walked toward the kitchen at the back of the room, accessible\nthrough an archway. \u201cBecause you look high off your ass, too.\u201d\nDeclan called from the sectional couch at the other end of the living\nroom, a laptop on his knee and a very interested draki male half-sprawled\nover him, running clawed fingers through Dec\u2019s dark red hair, \u201cHey, Bryce.\nTo what do we owe the pleasure?\u201d\nBryce jerked her thumb back at Ruhn. \u201cChecking on the Chosen One.\nHow\u2019s your fancy tech crap going, Dec?\u201d\nDeclan Emmet didn\u2019t usually appreciate anyone belittling the lucrative\ncareer he\u2019d built on a foundation of hacking into Republic websites and\nthen charging them ungodly amounts of money to reveal their critical\nweaknesses, but he grinned. \u201cStill raking in the marks.\u201d\n\u201cNice,\u201d Bryce said, continuing into the kitchen and out of sight.\nSome of the Aux warriors were staring toward the kitchen now, blatant\ninterest in their eyes. Flynn growled softly, \u201cShe\u2019s off-limits, assholes.\u201d\nThat was all it took. Not even a snapping vine of Flynn\u2019s earth magic,\nrare among the fire-prone Valbaran Fae. The others immediately returned\ntheir attention to the pool game. Ruhn threw his friend a grateful look and\nfollowed Bryce\u2014\nBut she was already back in the doorway, water bottle in hand. \u201cYour\nfridge is worse than mine,\u201d she said, shoving the bottle toward him and\nentering the living room again. Ruhn sipped as the stereo system in the back\nthumped the opening notes of a song, guitars wailing, and she angled her\nhead, listening, weighing.\nFae impulse\u2014to be drawn to music, and to love it. Perhaps the one\nside of her heritage she didn\u2019t mind. He remembered her showing him her\ndance routines as a young teenager. She\u2019d always looked so unbelievably\nhappy. He\u2019d never had the chance to ask why she stopped.\nRuhn sighed, forcing himself to focus, and said to Bryce, \u201cWhy are\nyou here?\u201d\nShe stopped near the sectional. \u201cI told you: I need to talk to you.\u201d\nRuhn kept his face blank. He couldn\u2019t remember the last time she\u2019d\nbothered finding him.\n\u201cWhy would your cousin need an excuse to chat with us?\u201d Flynn\nasked, murmuring something in the dryad\u2019s delicate ear that had her\nheading for the cluster of her three friends at the pool table, her narrow hips\nswishing in a reminder of what he\u2019d miss if he waited too long. Flynn\ndrawled, \u201cShe knows we\u2019re the most charming males in town.\u201d\nNeither of his friends ever guessed the truth\u2014or at least voiced any\nsuspicions. Bryce tossed her hair over a shoulder as Flynn rose from his\narmchair. \u201cI have better things to do\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThan hang out with Fae losers,\u201d Flynn finished for her, heading to the\nbuilt-in bar against the far wall. \u201cYeah, yeah. You\u2019ve said so a hundred\ntimes now. But look at that: here you are, hanging with us in our humble\nabode.\u201d\nDespite his carefree demeanor, Flynn would one day inherit his\nfather\u2019s title: Lord Hawthorne. Which meant that for the past several\ndecades, Flynn had done everything he could to forget that little fact\u2014and\nthe centuries of responsibilities it would entail. He poured himself a drink,\nthen a second one that he handed to Bryce. \u201cDrink up, honeycakes.\u201d\nRuhn rolled his eyes. But\u2014it was nearly midnight, and she was at their\nhouse, on one of the rougher streets in the Old Square, with a murderer on\nthe loose. Ruhn hissed, \u201cYou were given an order to lie low\u2014\u201d\nShe waved a hand, not touching the whiskey in her other. \u201cMy\nimperial escort is outside. Scaring everyone away, don\u2019t worry.\u201d\nBoth his friends went still. The draki male took that as an invitation to\ndrift away, aiming for the billiards game behind them as Declan twisted to\nlook at her. Ruhn just said, \u201cWho.\u201d\nA little smile. Bryce asked, swirling the whiskey in its glass, \u201cIs this\nhouse really befitting of the Chosen One?\u201d\nFlynn\u2019s mouth twitched. Ruhn shot him a warning glare, just daring\nhim to bring up the Starborn shit right now. Outside of his father\u2019s villa and\ncourt, all that had gotten Ruhn was a lifetime of teasing from his friends.\nRuhn ground out, \u201cLet\u2019s hear it, Bryce.\u201d Odds were, she\u2019d come here\njust to piss him off.\nShe didn\u2019t respond immediately, though. No, Bryce traced a circle on a\ncushion, utterly unfazed by the three Fae warriors watching her every\nbreath. Tristan and Declan had been Ruhn\u2019s best friends for as long as he\ncould remember, and always had his back, no questions asked. That they\nwere highly trained and efficient warriors was beside the point, though\nthey\u2019d saved each other\u2019s asses more times than Ruhn could count. Going\nthrough their Ordeals together had only cemented that bond.\nThe Ordeal itself varied depending on the person: for some, it might be\nas simple as overcoming an illness or a bit of personal strife. For others, it\nmight be slaying a wyrm or a demon. The greater the Fae, the greater the\nOrdeal.\nRuhn had been learning to wield his shadows from his hateful cousins\nin Avallen, his two friends with him, when they\u2019d all gone through their\nOrdeal, nearly dying in the process. It had culminated in Ruhn entering the\nmist-shrouded Cave of Princes, and emerging with the Starsword\u2014and\nsaving them all.\nAnd when he\u2019d made the Drop weeks later, it had been Flynn, fresh\nfrom his own Drop, who\u2019d Anchored him.\nDeclan asked, his deep voice rumbling over the music and chatter,\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\nFor a second, Bryce\u2019s swagger faltered. She glanced at them: their\ncasual clothes, the places where she knew their guns were hidden even in\ntheir own home, their black boots and the knives tucked inside them.\nBryce\u2019s eyes met Ruhn\u2019s.\n\u201cI know what that look means,\u201d Flynn groaned. \u201cIt means you don\u2019t\nwant us to hear.\u201d\nBryce didn\u2019t take her eyes away from Ruhn as she said, \u201cYep.\u201d\nDeclan slammed his laptop shut. \u201cYou\u2019re really gonna go all\nmysterious and shit?\u201d\nShe looked between Declan and Flynn, who had been inseparable\nsince birth. \u201cYou two dickbags have the biggest mouths in town.\u201d\nFlynn winked. \u201cI thought you liked my mouth.\u201d\n\u201cKeep dreaming, lordling.\u201d Bryce smirked.\nDeclan chuckled, earning a sharp elbow from Flynn and the glass of\nwhiskey from Bryce.\nRuhn swigged from his water, willing his head to clear further.\n\u201cEnough of this crap,\u201d he bit out. All that mirthroot threatened to turn on\nhim as he pulled Bryce toward his bedroom again.\nWhen they arrived, he took up a spot by the bed. \u201cWell?\u201d\nBryce leaned against the door, the wood peppered with holes from all\nthe knives he\u2019d chucked at it for idle target practice. \u201cI need you to tell me\nif you\u2019ve heard anything about what the Viper Queen\u2019s been up to.\u201d\nThis could not be good. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cBecause I need to talk to her.\u201d\n\u201cAre you fucking nuts?\u201d\nAgain, that annoying-ass smile. \u201cMaximus Tertian was killed on her\nturf. Did the Aux get any intel about her movements that night?\u201d\n\u201cYour boss put you up to this?\u201d It reeked of Roga.\n\u201cMaybe. Do you know anything?\u201d She angled her head again, that\nsilky sheet of hair\u2014the same as their father\u2019s\u2014shifting with the movement.\n\u201cYes. Tertian\u2019s murder was \u2026 the same as Danika\u2019s and the pack\u2019s.\u201d\nAny trace of a smile faded from her face. \u201cPhilip Briggs didn\u2019t do it. I\nwant to know what the Viper Queen was up to that night. If the Aux has any\nknowledge of her movements.\u201d\nRuhn shook his head. \u201cWhy are you involved in this?\u201d\n\u201cBecause I was asked to look into it.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t fuck with this case. Tell your boss to lay off. This is a matter\nfor the Governor.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the Governor commandeered me to look for the murderer. He\nthinks I\u2019m the link between them.\u201d\nGreat. Absolutely fantastic. Isaiah Tiberian had failed to mention that\nlittle fact. \u201cYou spoke to the Governor.\u201d\n\u201cJust answer my question. Does the Aux know anything about the\nViper Queen\u2019s whereabouts on the night of Tertian\u2019s death?\u201d\nRuhn blew out a breath. \u201cNo. I\u2019ve heard that she pulled her people\nfrom the streets. Something spooked her. But that\u2019s all I know. And even if I\nknew the Viper Queen\u2019s alibis, I wouldn\u2019t tell you. Stay the fuck out of this.\nI\u2019ll call the Governor to tell him you\u2019re done being his personal\ninvestigator.\u201d\nThat icy look\u2014their father\u2019s look\u2014passed over her face. The sort of\nlook that told him there was a wild, wicked storm raging beneath that cold\nexterior. And the power and thrill for both father and daughter lay not in\nsheer force, but in the control over the self, over those impulses.\nThe outside world saw his sister as reckless, unchecked\u2014but he knew\nshe\u2019d been the master of her fate since before he\u2019d met her. Bryce was just\none of those people who, once she\u2019d set her sights on what she wanted,\ndidn\u2019t let anything get in her way. If she wanted to sleep around, she did it.\nIf she wanted to party for three days straight, she did it. If she wanted to\ncatch Danika\u2019s murderer \u2026\n\u201cI am going to find the person behind this,\u201d she said with quiet fury.\n\u201cIf you try to interfere with it, I will make your life a living Hel.\u201d\n\u201cThe demon that murderer is using is lethal.\u201d He\u2019d seen the crime\nscene photos. The thought that Bryce had been saved by mere minutes, by\nsheer drunken stupidity, still twisted him up. Ruhn continued before she\ncould answer. \u201cThe Autumn King told you to lie low until the Summit\u2014this\nis the fucking opposite, Bryce.\u201d\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s now part of my job. Jesiba signed off on it. I can\u2019t very well\nrefuse, can I?\u201d\nNo. No one could say no to that sorceress.\nHe slid his hands into the back pockets of his jeans. \u201cShe ever tell you\nanything about Luna\u2019s Horn?\u201d\nBryce\u2019s brows lifted at the shift in subject, but considering Jesiba\nRoga\u2019s field of work, she\u2019d be the one to ask.\n\u201cShe had me look for it two years ago,\u201d Bryce said warily. \u201cBut it was\na dead end. Why?\u201d\n\u201cNever mind.\u201d He eyed the small gold amulet around his sister\u2019s neck.\nAt least Jesiba gave her that much protection. Expensive protection, too\u2014\nand powerful. Archesian amulets didn\u2019t come cheap, not when there were\nonly a few in the world. He nodded to it. \u201cDon\u2019t take that off.\u201d\nBryce rolled her eyes. \u201cDoes everyone in this city think I\u2019m dumb?\u201d\n\u201cI mean it. Beyond the shit you do for work, if you\u2019re looking for\nsomeone strong enough to summon a demon like that, don\u2019t take that\nnecklace off.\u201d At least he could remind her to be smart.\nShe just opened the door. \u201cIf you hear anything about the Viper Queen,\ncall me.\u201d\nRuhn stiffened, his heart thundering. \u201cDo not provoke her.\u201d\n\u201cBye, Ruhn.\u201d\nHe was desperate enough that he said, \u201cI\u2019ll go with you to\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBye.\u201d Then she was down the stairs, waving in that annoying-as-fuck\nway at Declan and Flynn, before swaggering out the front door.\nHis friends threw inquisitive looks to where Ruhn stood on the second-\nfloor landing. Declan\u2019s whiskey was still raised to his lips.\nRuhn counted to ten, if only to keep from snapping the nearest object\nin half, and then vaulted over the railing, landing so hard that the scuffed\noak planks shuddered.\nHe felt, more than saw, his friends fall into place behind him, hands\nwithin easy reach of their hidden weapons, drinks discarded as they read the\nfury on his face. Ruhn stormed through the front door and out into the brisk\nnight.\nJust in time to see Bryce strut across the street. To Hunt fucking\nAthalar.\n\u201cWhat the actual Hel,\u201d Declan breathed, halting beside Ruhn on the\nporch.\nThe Umbra Mortis looked pissed, his arms crossed and wings flaring\nslightly, but Bryce just breezed past him without so much as a glance.\nCausing Athalar to slowly turn, arms slackening at his sides, as if such a\nthing had never happened in his long, miserable life.\nAnd wasn\u2019t that enough to put Ruhn in a killing sort of mood.\nRuhn cleared the porch and front lawn and stepped into the street,\nholding out a hand to the car that skidded to a screeching halt. His hand hit\nthe hood, fingers curving. Metal dented beneath it.\nThe driver, wisely, didn\u2019t scream.\nRuhn strode between two parked sedans, Declan and Flynn close\nbehind, just as Hunt turned to see what the fuss was about.\nUnderstanding flashed in Hunt\u2019s eyes, quickly replaced by a half\nsmile. \u201cPrince.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing here?\u201d\nHunt jerked his chin toward Bryce, already disappearing down the\nstreet. \u201cProtection duty.\u201d\n\u201cLike Hel you\u2019re watching her.\u201d Isaiah Tiberian had failed to mention\nthis, too.\nA shrug. \u201cNot my call.\u201d The halo across his brow seemed to darken as\nhe sized up Declan and Flynn. Athalar\u2019s mouth twitched upward, onyx eyes\nglinting with an unspoken challenge.\nFlynn\u2019s gathering power had the earth beneath the pavement rumbling.\nHunt\u2019s shit-eating grin only spread.\nRuhn said, \u201cTell the Governor to put someone else on the case.\u201d\nHunt\u2019s grin sharpened. \u201cNot an option. Not when it plays to my\nexpertise.\u201d\nRuhn bristled at the arrogance. Sure, Athalar was one of the best\ndemon-hunters out there, but fuck, he\u2019d even take Tiberian on this case over\nthe Umbra Mortis.\nA year ago, the Commander of the 33rd hadn\u2019t been dumb enough to\nget between them when Ruhn had launched himself at Athalar, having had\nenough of his snide remarks at the fancy-ass Spring Equinox party Micah\nthrew every March. He\u2019d broken a few of Athalar\u2019s ribs, but the asshole had\ngotten in a punch that had left Ruhn\u2019s nose shattered and gushing blood all\nover the marble floors of the Comitium\u2019s penthouse ballroom. Neither of\nthem had been pissed enough to unleash their power in the middle of a\ncrowded room, but fists had done just fine.\nRuhn calculated how much trouble he\u2019d be in if he punched the\nGovernor\u2019s personal assassin again. Maybe it\u2019d be enough to get Hypaxia\nEnador to refuse to consider marrying him.\nRuhn demanded, \u201cDid you figure out what kind of demon did it?\u201d\n\u201cSomething that eats little princes for breakfast,\u201d Hunt crooned.\nRuhn bared his teeth. \u201cBlow me, Athalar.\u201d\nLightning danced over the angel\u2019s fingers. \u201cMust be easy to run your\nmouth when you\u2019re bankrolled by your father.\u201d Hunt pointed to the white\nhouse. \u201cHe buy that for you, too?\u201d\nRuhn\u2019s shadows rose to meet the lightning wreathing Athalar\u2019s fists,\nsetting the parked cars behind him shuddering. He\u2019d learned from his\ncousins in Avallen how to make the shadows solidify\u2014how to wield them\nas whips and shields and pure torment. Physical and mental.\nBut mixing magic and drugs was never a good idea. Fists it would\nhave to be, then. And all it would take was one swing, right into Athalar\u2019s\nface\u2014\nDeclan growled, \u201cThis isn\u2019t the time or place.\u201d\nNo, it wasn\u2019t. Even Athalar seemed to remember the gawking people,\nthe upraised phones recording everything. And the red-haired female\nnearing the end of the block. Hunt smirked. \u201cBye, assholes.\u201d He followed\nBryce, lightning skittering over the pavement in his wake.\nRuhn growled at the angel\u2019s back, \u201cDo not fucking let her go to the\nViper Queen.\u201d\nAthalar glanced over a shoulder, his gray wings tucking in. His blink\ntold Ruhn that he hadn\u2019t been aware of Bryce\u2019s agenda. A shiver of\nsatisfaction ran through Ruhn. But Athalar continued down the street,\npeople pressing themselves against buildings to give him a wide berth. The\nwarrior\u2019s focus remained on Bryce\u2019s exposed neck.\nFlynn shook his head like a wet dog. \u201cI literally can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m\nhallucinating right now.\u201d\n\u201cI wish I were,\u201d Ruhn muttered. He\u2019d need to smoke another mountain\nof mirthroot to mellow the Hel out again. But if Hunt Athalar was watching\nBryce \u2026 He\u2019d heard enough rumors to know what Hunt could do to an\nopponent. That he, in addition to being a prime bastard, was relentless,\nsingle-minded, and utterly brutal when it came to eliminating threats.\nHunt had to obey the order to protect her. No matter what.\nRuhn studied them as they walked away. Bryce would speed up; Hunt\nwould match her pace. She\u2019d drop back; he\u2019d do the same. She\u2019d edge him\nto the right, right, right\u2014off the curb and into oncoming traffic; he\u2019d\nnarrowly avoid a swerving car and step back onto the sidewalk.\nRuhn was half-tempted to trail them, just to watch the battle of wills.\n\u201cI need a drink,\u201d Declan muttered. Flynn agreed and the two of them\nheaded back toward the house, leaving Ruhn alone on the street.\nCould it really be a coincidence that the murders were starting again at\nthe same time his father had given the order to find an object that had gone\nmissing a week before Danika\u2019s death?\nIt felt \u2026 odd. Like Urd was whispering, nudging them all.\nRuhn planned to find out why. Starting with finding that Horn."}, "17": {"Name": "PART II THE TRENCH-Chapter 17", "Page Content": " 7 \nBryce had just succeeded in nudging Hunt into oncoming traffic when he\nasked, \u201cDo I get an explanation for why I\u2019ve had to trail you like a dog all\nnight?\u201d\nBryce shoved her hand into the pocket of her jeans and pulled out a\npiece of paper. Then silently handed it to Hunt.\nHis brow furrowed. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\n\u201cMy list of suspects,\u201d she said, letting him glance at the names before\nshe snatched it away.\n\u201cWhen did you make this?\u201d\nShe said sweetly, \u201cLast night. On the couch.\u201d\nA muscle ticked in his jaw. \u201cAnd you were going to tell me when?\u201d\n\u201cAfter you\u2019d spent a whole day assuming I was a dumb, vapid female\nmore interested in getting my nails done than solving this case.\u201d\n\u201cYou did get your nails done.\u201d\nShe waved her pretty ombre fingernails in his face. He looked half-\ninclined to bite them. \u201cDo you know what else I did last night?\u201d His silence\nwas delightful. \u201cI looked up Maximus Tertian some more. Because despite\nwhat the Governor says, there was no fucking way Danika knew him. And\nyou know what? I was right. And you know how I know I\u2019m right?\u201d\n\u201cCthona fucking save me,\u201d Hunt muttered.\n\u201cBecause I looked up his profile on Spark.\u201d\n\u201cThe dating site?\u201d\n\u201cThe dating site. Turns out even creepy vamps are looking for love,\ndeep down. And it showed that he was in a relationship. Which apparently\ndid nothing to stop him from hitting on me, but that\u2019s beside the point. So I\ndid some more digging. And found his girlfriend.\u201d\n\u201cFuck.\u201d\n\u201cAren\u2019t there people at the 33rd who should be doing this shit?\u201d When\nhe refused to answer, she grinned. \u201cGuess where Tertian\u2019s girlfriend\nworks.\u201d\nHunt\u2019s eyes simmered. He said through his teeth, \u201cAt the nail salon on\nSamson.\u201d\n\u201cAnd guess who did my nails and got to chatting about the terrible loss\nof her rich-ass boyfriend?\u201d\nHe ran his hands through his hair, looking so disbelieving that she\nchuckled. He snarled, \u201cStop with the fucking questions and just tell me,\nQuinlan.\u201d\nShe examined her gorgeous new nails. \u201cTertian\u2019s girlfriend didn\u2019t\nknow anything about who might have wanted to murder him. She said the\n33rd did vaguely question her, but that was it. So I told her that I\u2019d lost\nsomeone, too.\u201d It was an effort to keep her voice steady as the memory of\nthat bloody apartment flashed. \u201cShe asked me who, I told her, and she\nlooked so shocked that I asked if Tertian was friends with Danika. She told\nme no. She said she would have known if Maximus was, because Danika\nwas famous enough that he\u2019d have been bragging about it. The closest to\nDanika she or Tertian got was through two degrees of separation\u2014through\nthe Viper Queen. Whose nails she does on Sundays.\u201d\n\u201cDanika knew the Viper Queen?\u201d\nBryce held up the list. \u201cDanika\u2019s job in the Aux made her a friend and\nenemy to a lot of people. The Viper Queen was one of them.\u201d\nHunt paled. \u201cYou honestly think the Viper Queen killed Danika?\u201d\n\u201cTertian was found dead just over her borders. Ruhn said she pulled\nher people in last night. And no one knows what kind of powers she has.\nShe could have summoned that demon.\u201d\n\u201cThat is a big fucking accusation to make.\u201d\n\u201cWhich is why we need to feel her out. This is the only clue we have\nto go on.\u201d\nHunt shook his head. \u201cAll right. I can buy the possibility. But we need\nto go through the right channels to contact her. It could be days or weeks\nbefore she deigns to meet with us. Longer, if she gets a whiff that we\u2019re\nonto her.\u201d\nWith someone like the Viper Queen, even the law was flexible.\nBryce scoffed. \u201cDon\u2019t be such a stickler for the rules.\u201d\n\u201cThe rules are there to keep us alive. We follow them, or we don\u2019t go\nafter her at all.\u201d\nShe waved a hand. \u201cFine.\u201d\nA muscle ticked in his jaw again. \u201cAnd what about Ruhn? You just\ndragged your cousin into our business.\u201d\n\u201cMy cousin,\u201d she said tightly, \u201cwill be unable to resist the urge to\ninform his father that a member of the Fae race has been commandeered for\nan imperial investigation. How he reacts, who he contacts, might be worth\nnoting.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2014you think the Autumn King could have done this?\u201d\n\u201cNo. But Ruhn was given an order to warn me to keep out of trouble\nthe night of Maximus\u2019s murder\u2014maybe the old bastard knew something,\ntoo. I\u2019d suggest telling your people to watch him. See what he does and\nwhere he goes.\u201d\n\u201cGods,\u201d Hunt breathed, striding past gawking pedestrians. \u201cYou want\nme to just put a tail on the Autumn King like it\u2019s not a violation of about ten\ndifferent laws?\u201d\n\u201cMicah said to do whatever was necessary.\u201d\n\u201cThe Autumn King has free rein to kill anyone found stalking him like\nthat.\u201d\n\u201cThen you better tell your spies to keep themselves hidden.\u201d\nHunt snapped his wings. \u201cDon\u2019t play games again. If you know\nsomething, tell me.\u201d\n\u201cI was going to tell you everything when I finished up at the nail salon\nthis morning.\u201d She put her hands on her hips. \u201cBut then you bit my head\noff.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever, Quinlan. Don\u2019t do it again. You tell me before you make a\nmove.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m getting real bored with you giving me orders and forbidding me\nto do things.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever,\u201d he said again. She rolled her eyes, but they\u2019d reached her\nbuilding. Neither bothered to say goodbye before Hunt leapt into the skies,\naiming for the adjacent roof, a phone already at his ear.\nBryce rode the elevator up to her floor, mulling everything over in the\nsilence. She\u2019d meant what she said to Hunt\u2014she didn\u2019t think her father was\nbehind Danika\u2019s and the pack\u2019s deaths. She had little doubt he\u2019d killed\nothers, though. And would do anything to keep his crown.\nThe Autumn King was a courtesy title in addition to her father\u2019s role as\na City Head\u2014as for all the seven Fae Kings. No kingdom was truly their\nown. Even Avallen, the green isle ruled by the Stag King, still bowed to the\nRepublic.\nThe Fae had coexisted with the Republic since its founding,\nanswerable to its laws, but ultimately left to govern themselves and retain\ntheir ancient titles of kings and princes and the like. Still respected by all\u2014\nand feared. Not as much as the angels, with their destructive, hideous\nstorm-and-sky powers, but they could inflict pain if they wished. Choke the\nair from your lungs or freeze you or burn you from the inside out. Solas\nknew Ruhn and his two friends could raise Hel when provoked.\nBut she wasn\u2019t looking to raise Hel tonight. She was looking to quietly\nslip into its Midgard equivalent.\nWhich was precisely why she waited thirty minutes before tucking a\nknife into her black leather ankle boots, and placed something that packed a\nbigger punch into the back of her dark jeans, hidden beneath her leather\njacket. She kept the lights and television on, the curtains partially closed\u2014\njust enough to block Hunt\u2019s view of her front door as she left.\nSneaking out the rear stairwell of her building to the small alley where\nher scooter was chained, Bryce took a swift, bracing breath before fitting on\nher helmet.\nTraffic wasn\u2019t moving as she unchained the ivory Firebright 3500\nscooter from the alley lamppost and waddled it onto the cobblestones. She\nwaited for other scooters, pedicabs, and motorcycles to zip past, then\nlaunched into the flow, the world stark through the visor of her helmet.\nHer mother still complained about the scooter, begging her to use a car\nuntil after the Drop, but Randall had always insisted Bryce was fine. Of\ncourse, she never told them of the various incidents on this scooter, but \u2026\nher mother had a mortal life span. Bryce didn\u2019t need to shave off any more\nyears than necessary.\nBryce cruised down one of the city\u2019s main arteries, losing herself in the\nrhythm of weaving between cars and swerving around pedestrians. The\nworld was a blur of golden light and deep shadows, neon glaring above, all\nof it accented by pops and flittering shimmers of street magic. Even the\nlittle bridges she crossed, spanning the countless tributaries to the Istros,\nwere strung with sparkling lights that danced on the dim, drifting water\nbelow.\nHigh above Main Street, a silvery sheen filled the night sky, limning\nthe drifting clouds where the malakim partied and dined. Only a flare of red\ninterrupted the pale glow, courtesy of Redner Industries\u2019 massive sign atop\ntheir skyscraper in the heart of the district.\nFew people walked the streets of the CBD at this hour, and Bryce\nmade sure to get through its canyons of high-rises as swiftly as possible.\nShe knew she\u2019d entered the Meat Market not by any street or marker, but by\nthe shift in the darkness.\nNo lights stained the skies above the low brick buildings crammed\ntogether. And here the shadows became permanent, tucked into alleys and\nunder cars, the streetlamps mostly shattered and never repaired.\nBryce pulled down a cramped street where a few dented delivery\ntrucks were in the process of unloading boxes of spiky green fruit and crates\nof crustacean-looking creatures that seemed far too aware of their captivity\nand oncoming demise via boiling pots of water in one of the food stalls.\nBryce tried not to meet their googly black eyes pleading with her\nthrough the wooden bars as she parked a few feet away from a nondescript\nwarehouse, removed her helmet, and waited.\nVendors and shoppers alike eyed her to glean if she was selling or for\nsale. In the warrens below, carved deep into Midgard\u2019s womb, lay three\ndifferent levels just for flesh. Mostly human; mostly living, though she\u2019d\nheard of some places that specialized in certain tastes. Every fetish could be\nbought; no taboo was too foul. Half-breeds were prized: they could heal\nfaster and better than full-humans. A smarter long-term investment. And\noccasional Vanir were enslaved and bound with so many enchantments that\nthey had no hope of escape. Only the wealthiest could afford to purchase a\nfew hours with them.\nBryce checked the time on her scooter\u2019s dash clock. Crossing her\narms, she leaned against the black leather seat.\nThe Umbra Mortis slammed to the ground, cracking the cobblestones\nin a rippling circle.\nHunt\u2019s eyes practically glowed as he said, in full view of those\ncowering along the street, \u201cI am going to kill you.\u201d"}, "18": {"Name": "PART II THE TRENCH-Chapter 18", "Page Content": " 8 \nHunt stormed toward Bryce, stepping over the cobblestones fragmented\nfrom his landing. He\u2019d detected her lilac-and-nutmeg scent on the wind the\nmoment she\u2019d stepped outside the back door of her building, and when he\u2019d\ndiscovered where, precisely, she was driving on that scooter \u2026\nBryce had the nerve to push back the sleeve of her leather jacket,\nfrown at her bare wrist as if she were reading a gods-damned watch, and\nsay, \u201cYou\u2019re two minutes late.\u201d\nHe was going to throttle her. Someone should have done it a long\nfucking time ago.\nBryce smiled in a way that said she\u2019d like to see him try, and sauntered\ntoward him, scooter and helmet left behind.\nUnbelievable. Un-fucking-believable.\nHunt growled, \u201cThere\u2019s no way that scooter is there when we get\nback.\u201d\nBryce batted her eyelashes, fluffing out her helmet hair. \u201cGood thing\nyou\u2019ve made such a big entrance. No one would dare touch it now. Not with\nthe Umbra Mortis as my wrathful companion.\u201d\nIndeed, people shrank from his gaze, some stepping behind the stacked\ncrates as Bryce aimed for one of the open doors into the labyrinth of\nsubterraneanly interconnected warehouses that made up the blocks of the\ndistrict.\nEven Micah didn\u2019t station legionaries here. The Meat Market had its\nown laws and methods of enforcing them.\nHunt ground out, \u201cI told you that there are protocols to follow if we\nwant to stand a chance of contacting the Viper Queen\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to contact the Viper Queen.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d The Viper Queen had ruled the Meat Market for longer than\nanyone could remember. Hunt made a point\u2014all the angels, whether\ncivilians or legionaries, made a point\u2014of staying the fuck away from the\nserpentine shifter, whose snake form, rumor claimed, was a true horror to\nbehold. Before Bryce could answer, Hunt said, \u201cI\u2019m growing tired of this\nbullshit, Quinlan.\u201d\nShe bared her teeth. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she seethed, \u201cif your fragile ego can\u2019t\nhandle that I know what I\u2019m fucking doing.\u201d\nHunt opened and closed his mouth. Fine, he\u2019d misjudged her earlier\ntoday, but she hadn\u2019t exactly given him any hint of being remotely\ninterested in this investigation. Or that she wasn\u2019t trying to hinder it.\nBryce continued through the open doors to the warehouse without\nsaying another word.\nBeing in the 33rd\u2014or any legion\u2014was as good as putting a target on\nyour back, and Hunt checked that his weapons were in place in the cleverly\nconstructed sheaths along his suit as he followed her.\nThe reek of bodies and smoke coated his face like oil. Hunt tucked in\nhis wings tightly.\nWhatever fear he\u2019d instilled in people on the streets was of no\nconsequence inside the market, packed with ramshackle stalls and vendors\nand food stands, smoke drifting throughout, the tang of blood and spark of\nmagic acrid in his nostrils. And above it all, against the far wall of the\nenormous space, was a towering mosaic, the tiles taken from an ancient\ntemple in Pangera, restored and re-created here in loving detail, despite its\ngruesome depiction: cloaked and hooded death, the skeleton\u2019s face grinning\nout from the cowl, a scythe in one hand and an hourglass in the other.\nAbove its head, words had been crafted in the Republic\u2019s most ancient\nlanguage:\nMemento Mori.\nRemember that you will die. It was meant to be an invitation for\nmerriment, to seize each moment as if it were one\u2019s last, as if tomorrow\nwere not guaranteed, even for slow-aging Vanir. Remember that you will\ndie, and enjoy each pleasure the world has to offer. Remember that you will\ndie, and none of this illegal shit will matter anyway. Remember that you will\ndie, so who cares how many people suffer from your actions?\nBryce swept past it, her swaying hair shining like the heart of a ruby.\nThe lights illuminated the worn black leather of her jacket, bringing into\nstark relief the painted words along the back in feminine, colorful script. It\nwas instinct to translate\u2014also from the ancient language, as if Urd herself\nhad chosen this moment to lay the two ancient phrases before him.\nThrough love, all is possible.\nSuch a pretty phrase was a fucking joke in a place like this.\nGlimmering eyes that tracked Quinlan from the stalls and shadows quickly\nlooked away when they noticed him at her side.\nIt was an effort not to haul her out of this shithole. Even though he\nwanted this case solved, having only ten beautiful kills standing between\nhim and freedom, coming here was a colossal risk. What was the use of his\nfreedom if he was left in a dumpster behind one of these warehouses?\nMaybe that was what she wanted. To lure him here\u2014use the Meat\nMarket itself to kill him. It seemed unlikely, but he kept one eye on her.\nBryce knew her way around. Knew a few of the vendors, from the\nnods they exchanged. Hunt marked each one: a metalworker specializing in\nintricate little mechanisms; a fruit vendor with exotic produce for sale; an\nowl-faced female who had a spread of scrolls and books bound in materials\nthat were everything but cow leather.\n\u201cThe metalworker helps me identify if an artifact is a fake,\u201d Bryce said\nunder her breath as they wound through the steam and smoke of a food pit.\nHow she\u2019d noticed his observing, he had no idea. \u201cAnd the fruit lady gets\nshipments of durian in the early spring and fall\u2014Syrinx\u2019s favorite food.\nStinks up the whole house, but he goes nuts for it.\u201d She edged around a\ngarbage pail near-overflowing with discarded plates and bones and soiled\nnapkins before ascending a rickety set of stairs to the mezzanine flanking\neither side of the warehouse floor, doors stationed every few feet.\n\u201cThe books?\u201d Hunt couldn\u2019t help asking. She seemed to be counting\ndoors, rather than looking at the numbers. There were no numbers, he\nrealized.\n\u201cThe books,\u201d Bryce said, \u201care a story for another time.\u201d She paused\noutside a pea-green door, chipped and deeply gouged in spots. Hunt sniffed,\ntrying to detect what lay beyond. Nothing, as far as he could detect. He\nsubtly braced himself, keeping his hands within range of his weapons.\nBryce opened the door, not bothering to knock, revealing flickering\ncandles and\u2014brine. Salt. Smoke and something that dried out his eyes.\nBryce stalked down the cramped hallway to the open, rotting sitting\nroom beyond. Scowling, he shut the door and followed, wings tucked in to\nkeep from brushing the oily, crumbling walls. If Quinlan died, Micah\u2019s offer\nwould be off the table.\nWhite and ivory candles guttered as Bryce walked onto the worn green\ncarpet, and Hunt held in his cringe. A sagging, ripped couch was shoved\nagainst a wall, a filthy leather armchair with half its stuffing bursting from it\nsat against the other, and around the room, on tables and stacks of books\nand half-broken chairs, were jars and bowls and cups full of salt.\nWhite salt, black salt, gray salt\u2014in grains of every size: from near-\npowder to flakes to great, rough hunks of it. Salts for protection against\ndarker powers. Against demons. Many Vanir built their houses with slabs of\nsalt at the cornerstones. Rumor claimed that the entire base of the Asteri\u2019s\ncrystal palace was a slab of salt. That it had been built atop a natural\ndeposit.\nFucking Hel. He\u2019d never seen such an assortment. As Bryce peered\ndown the darkened hall to the left, where the shadows yielded three doors,\nHunt hissed, \u201cPlease tell me\u2014\u201d\n\u201cJust keep your snarling and eye rolling to yourself,\u201d she snapped at\nhim, and called into the gloom, \u201cI\u2019m here to buy, not collect.\u201d\nOne of the doors cracked open, and a pale-skinned, dark-haired satyr\nhobbled toward them, his furred legs hidden by trousers. His pageboy hat\nmust have hid little, curling horns. The clopping of the hooves gave him\naway.\nThe male barely came up to Bryce\u2019s chest, his shrunken, twisted body\nhalf the size of the bulls that Hunt had witnessed tearing people into shreds\non battlefields. And that he had faced himself in Sandriel\u2019s arena. The\nmale\u2019s slitted pupils, knobbed at either side like a goat\u2019s, expanded.\nFear\u2014and not at Hunt\u2019s presence, he realized with a jolt.\nBryce dipped her fingers into a lead bowl of pink salt, plucking up a\nfew pieces and letting them drop into the dish with faint, hollow cracks. \u201cI\nneed the obsidian.\u201d\nThe satyr shifted, hooves clopping faintly, rubbing his hairy, pale neck.\n\u201cDon\u2019t deal in that.\u201d\nShe smiled slightly. \u201cOh?\u201d She went over to another bowl, stirring the\npowder-fine black salt in there. \u201cGrade A, whole-rock obsidian salt. Seven\npounds, seven ounces. Now.\u201d\nThe male\u2019s throat bobbed. \u201cIt\u2019s illegal.\u201d\n\u201cAre you quoting the motto of the Meat Market, or trying to tell me\nthat you somehow don\u2019t have precisely what I need?\u201d\nHunt scanned the room. White salt for purification; pink for protection;\ngray for spellwork; red for \u2026 he forgot what the Hel red was for. But\nobsidian \u2026 Shit.\nHunt fell back on centuries of training to keep the shock off his face.\nBlack salts were used for summoning demons directly\u2014bypassing the\nNorthern Rift entirely\u2014or for various dark spellwork. A salt that went\nbeyond black, a salt like the obsidian \u2026 It could summon something big.\nHel was severed from them by time and space, but still accessible\nthrough the twin sealed portals at the north and south poles\u2014the Northern\nRift and the Southern Rift, respectively. Or by idiots who tried to summon\ndemons through salts of varying powers.\nA lot of fucked-up shit, Hunt had always thought. The benefit of using\nsalts, at least, was that only one demon could be summoned at a time.\nThough if things went badly, the summoner could wind up dead. And a\ndemon could wind up stuck in Midgard, hungry.\nIt was why the creeps existed in their world at all: most had been\nhunted after those long-ago wars between realms, but every so often,\ndemons got loose. Reproduced, usually by force.\nThe result of those horrible unions: the daemonaki. Most walking the\nstreets were diluted, weaker incarnations and hybrids of the purebred\ndemons in Hel. Many were pariahs, through no fault of their own beyond\ngenetics, and they usually worked hard to integrate into the Republic. But\nthe lowest-level purebred demon fresh out of Hel could bring an entire city\nto a standstill as it went on a rampage. And for centuries now, Hunt had\nbeen tasked with tracking them down.\nThis satyr had to be a big-time dealer then, if he peddled obsidian salt.\nBryce took a step toward the satyr. The male retreated. Her amber eyes\ngleamed with feral amusement, no doubt from her Fae side. A far cry from\nthe party girl getting her nails done.\nHunt tensed. She couldn\u2019t be that foolish, could she? To show him that\nshe knew how to and could easily acquire the same type of salt that had\nprobably been used to summon the demon that killed Tertian and Danika?\nAnother tally scratched itself into the Suspect column in his mind.\nBryce shrugged with one shoulder. \u201cI could call your queen. See what\nshe makes of it.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2014you don\u2019t have the rank to summon her.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Bryce said, \u201cI don\u2019t. But I bet if I go down to the main floor and\nstart screaming for the Viper Queen, she\u2019ll drag herself out of that fighting\npit to see what the fuss is about.\u201d\nBurning Solas, she was serious, wasn\u2019t she?\nSweat beaded the satyr\u2019s brow. \u201cObsidian\u2019s too dangerous. I can\u2019t in\ngood conscience sell it.\u201d\nBryce crooned, \u201cDid you say that when you sold it to Philip Briggs for\nhis bombs?\u201d\nHunt stilled, and the male went a sickly white. He glanced to Hunt,\nnoting the tattoo across his brow, the armor he wore. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\nyou\u2019re talking about. I\u2014I was cleared by the investigators. I never sold\nBriggs anything.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he paid you in cash to hide the money trail,\u201d Bryce said. She\nyawned. \u201cLook, I\u2019m tired and hungry, and I don\u2019t feel like playing this\ngame. Name your price so I can be on my way.\u201d\nThose goatlike eyes snapped to hers. \u201cFifty thousand gold marks.\u201d\nBryce smiled as Hunt held in his curse. \u201cDo you know my boss paid\nfifty thousand to watch a pack of Helhounds rip apart a satyr? Said it was\nthe best minute of her miserable life.\u201d\n\u201cForty-five.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t waste my time with nonsense offers.\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t go below thirty. Not for that much obsidian.\u201d\n\u201cTen.\u201d Ten thousand gold marks was still outrageous. But summoning\nsalts were extraordinarily valuable. How many demons had he hunted\nbecause of them? How many dismembered bodies had he seen from\nsummonings gone wrong? Or right, if it was a targeted attack?\nBryce held up her phone. \u201cIn five minutes, I\u2019m expected to call Jesiba,\nand say that the obsidian salt is in my possession. In six minutes, if I do not\nmake that phone call, someone will knock on that door. And it will not be\nsomeone for me.\u201d\nHunt honestly couldn\u2019t tell if Quinlan was bluffing. She likely\nwouldn\u2019t have told him\u2014could have gotten that order from her boss while\nhe was sitting on the roof. If Jesiba Roga was dealing with whatever shit the\nobsidian implied, either for her own uses or on behalf of the Under-King \u2026\nMaybe Bryce hadn\u2019t committed the murder, but rather abetted it.\n\u201cFour minutes,\u201d Bryce said.\nSweat slid down the satyr\u2019s temple and into his thick beard. Silence.\nDespite his suspicions, Hunt had the creeping feeling that this\nassignment was either going to be a fuck-ton of fun or a nightmare. If it got\nhim to his end goal, he didn\u2019t care one way or another.\nBryce perched on the rotting arm of the chair and began typing into her\nphone, no more than a bored young woman avoiding social interaction.\nThe satyr whirled toward Hunt. \u201cYou\u2019re the Umbra Mortis.\u201d He\nswallowed audibly. \u201cYou\u2019re one of the triarii. You protect us\u2014you serve the\nGovernor.\u201d\nBefore Hunt could reply, Bryce lifted her phone to show him a photo\nof two fat, roly-poly puppies. \u201cLook what my cousin just adopted,\u201d she told\nhim. \u201cThat one is Osirys, and the one on the right is Set.\u201d She lowered the\nphone before he could come up with a response, thumbs flying.\nBut she glanced at Hunt from under her thick lashes. Play along,\nplease, she seemed to say.\nSo Hunt said, \u201cCute dogs.\u201d\nThe satyr let out a small whine of distress. Bryce lifted her head,\ncurtain of red hair limned with silver in her screen\u2019s light. \u201cI thought you\u2019d\nbe running to get the salt by now. Maybe you should, considering you\u2019ve\ngot\u201d\u2014a glance at the phone, fingers flying\u2014\u201coh. Ninety seconds.\u201d\nShe opened what looked like a message thread and began typing.\nThe satyr whispered, \u201cT-twenty thousand.\u201d\nShe held up a finger. \u201cI\u2019m writing back to my cousin. Give me two\nseconds.\u201d The satyr was trembling enough that Hunt almost felt bad.\nAlmost, until\u2014\n\u201cTen, ten, damn you! Ten!\u201d\nBryce smiled. \u201cNo need to shout,\u201d she purred, pressing a button that\nhad her phone ringing.\n\u201cYes?\u201d The sorceress picked up after the first ring.\n\u201cCall off your dogs.\u201d\nA breathy, feminine laugh. \u201cDone.\u201d\nBryce lowered the phone. \u201cWell?\u201d\nThe satyr rushed to the back, hooves thumping on the worn floors, and\nprocured a wrapped bundle a moment later. It reeked of mold and dirt.\nBryce lifted a brow. \u201cPut it in a bag.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a\u2014\u201d Bryce gave him a look. The satyr found one. A\nstained, reusable grocery bag, but better than holding the slab in public.\nBryce weighed the salt in her hands. \u201cIt\u2019s two ounces over.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s seven and seven! Just what you asked for! It\u2019s all cut to sevens.\u201d\nSeven\u2014the holy number. Or unholy, depending on who was\nworshipping. Seven Asteri, seven hills in their Eternal City, seven\nneighborhoods and seven Gates in Crescent City; seven planets, and seven\ncircles in Hel, with seven princes who ruled them, each darker than the last.\nBryce inclined her head. \u201cIf I measure it and it\u2019s not\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt is!\u201d the satyr cried. \u201cDark Hel, it is!\u201d\nBryce tapped some buttons on her phone. \u201cTen grand, transferred right\nto you.\u201d\nHunt kept at her back as she strode out, the satyr half-seething, half-\ntrembling behind them.\nShe opened the door, grinning to herself, and Hunt was about to start\ndemanding answers when she halted. When he also beheld who stood\noutside.\nThe tall, moon-skinned woman was dressed in a gold jumpsuit,\nemerald hoop earrings hanging lower than her chin-length black bob. Her\nfull lips were painted in purple so dark it was nearly black, and her\nremarkable green eyes \u2026 Hunt knew her by the eyes alone.\nHumanoid in every aspect, but for them. Green entirely, marbled with\nveins of jade and gold. Interrupted only by a slitted pupil now razor-thin in\nthe warehouse lights. A snake\u2019s eyes.\nOr a Viper Queen\u2019s."}, "19": {"Name": "PART II THE TRENCH-Chapter 19", "Page Content": " 9 \nBryce shouldered the canvas bag, surveying the Viper Queen. \u201cNice outfit.\u201d\nThe serpentine shifter smiled, revealing bright white teeth\u2014and\ncanines that were slightly too elongated. And slightly too thin. \u201cNice\nbodyguard.\u201d\nBryce shrugged as those snake\u2019s eyes dragged over every inch of Hunt.\n\u201cNothing going on upstairs, but everything happening where it counts.\u201d\nHunt stiffened. But the female\u2019s purple lips curved upward. \u201cI\u2019ve never\nheard Hunt Athalar described that way, but I\u2019m sure the general appreciates\nit.\u201d\nAt the near-forgotten title, Hunt\u2019s jaw tightened. Yes, the Viper Queen\nhad likely been alive during the Fall. Would have known Hunt not as one of\nthe 33rd\u2019s triarii or the Shadow of Death, but as General Hunt Athalar, High\nCommander of all the Archangel Shahar\u2019s legions.\nAnd Bryce had strung him along for two days. She glanced over a\nshoulder, finding Hunt assessing the Viper Queen and the four Fae males\nflanking her. Defectors from her father\u2019s court\u2014trained assassins in not just\nweapons, but the queen\u2019s specialty: venoms and poisons.\nNone of them deigned to acknowledge her.\nThe Viper Queen tilted her head to the side, the razor-sharp bob\nshifting like black silk. On the ground below, patrons milled about, unaware\nthat their ruler had graced them with her presence. \u201cLooks like you were\ndoing some shopping.\u201d\nBryce gave a half shrug. \u201cBargain hunting is a hobby. Your realm is the\nbest place for it.\u201d\n\u201cI thought your boss paid you too well for you to stoop to cutting\ncosts. And using salts.\u201d\nBryce forced herself to smile, to keep her heartbeat steady, knowing\nfull well the female could pick up on it. Could taste fear. Could likely taste\nwhat variety of salt, exactly, sat in the bag dangling from her shoulder. \u201cJust\nbecause I make money doesn\u2019t mean I have to get ripped off.\u201d\nThe Viper Queen glanced between her and Hunt. \u201cI heard you two\nhave been spotted around town together.\u201d\nHunt growled, \u201cIt\u2019s classified.\u201d\nThe Viper Queen arched a well-groomed black eyebrow, the small\nbeauty mark just beneath the outer corner of her eye shifting with the\nmovement. Her gold-painted nails glinted as she reached a hand into the\npocket of her jumpsuit, fishing out a lighter encrusted with rubies forming\nthe shape of a striking asp. A cigarette appeared between her purple lips a\nmoment later, and they watched in silence, her guards monitoring every\nbreath they made, as she lit up and inhaled deeply. Smoke rippled from\nthose dark lips as she said, \u201cShit\u2019s getting interesting these days.\u201d\nBryce pivoted toward the exit. \u201cYep. Let\u2019s go, Hunt.\u201d\nOne of the guards stepped in front of her, six and a half feet of Fae\ngrace and muscle.\nBryce stopped short, Hunt nearly slamming into her\u2014his growl likely\nhis first and last warning to the male. But the guard merely gazed at his\nqueen, vacant and beholden. Likely addicted to the venom she secreted and\ndoled out to her inner circle.\nBryce looked over her shoulder at the Viper Queen, still leaning\nagainst the rail, still smoking that cigarette. \u201cIt\u2019s a good time for business,\u201d\nthe queen observed, \u201cwhen key players converge for the Summit. So many\nruling-class elites, all with their own \u2026 interests.\u201d\nHunt was close enough to Bryce\u2019s back that she could feel the tremor\nthat ran through his powerful body, could have sworn lightning tingled over\nher spine. But he said nothing.\nThe Viper Queen merely extended a hand to the walkway behind her,\ngold nails flashing in the light. \u201cMy office, if you will.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cWe\u2019re going.\u201d\nBryce stepped closer to the Viper Queen. \u201cLead the way, Majesty.\u201d\nShe did. Hunt was bristling at her side, but Bryce kept her eyes on the\nswaying, glossy bob of the female ahead of them. Her guards kept a few\nfeet behind\u2014far enough away that Hunt deemed it safe to mutter, \u201cThis is a\nterrible idea.\u201d\n\u201cYou were bitching this morning that I wasn\u2019t doing anything of\nvalue,\u201d Bryce muttered back as they trailed the Viper Queen through an\narchway and down a back set of stairs. From below, roaring and cheers rose\nto meet them. \u201cAnd now that I am doing something, you\u2019re bitching about\nit, too?\u201d She snorted. \u201cGet your shit together, Athalar.\u201d\nHis jaw tightened again. But he glanced at her bag, the block of salt\nweighing it down. \u201cYou bought the salt because you knew it\u2019d attract her\nattention.\u201d\n\u201cYou told me that it\u2019d take weeks to get a meeting with her. I decided\nto bypass all the bullshit.\u201d She tapped the bag, the salt thumping hollowly\nbeneath her hand.\n\u201cCthona\u2019s tits,\u201d he muttered, shaking his head. They exited the\nstairwell a level down, the walls solid concrete. Behind them, the roar of the\nfighting pit echoed down the corridor. But the Viper Queen glided ahead,\npassing rusty metal doors. Until she opened an unmarked one and swept in\nwithout so much as looking back. Bryce couldn\u2019t help her smug smile.\n\u201cDon\u2019t look so fucking satisfied,\u201d Hunt hissed. \u201cWe might not even\nwalk out of this place alive.\u201d True. \u201cI\u2019ll ask the questions.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nThey glowered at each other, and Bryce could have sworn lightning\nforked across his eyes. But they\u2019d reached the door, which opened into\u2014\nShe\u2019d been expecting the plush opulence of Griffin Antiquities hidden\nbehind that door: gilded mirrors and velvet divans and silk drapes and a\ncarved oak desk as old as this city.\nNot this \u2026 mess. It was barely better than the stockroom of a dive bar.\nA dented metal desk occupied most of the cramped space, a scratched\npurple chair behind it\u2014tufts of stuffing poking out of the upper corner, and\nthe pale green paint peeled off the wall in half a dozen spots. Not to\nmention the water stain gracing the ceiling, made worse by the thrumming\nfluorescent firstlights. Against one wall stood an open shelving unit filled\nwith everything from files to crates of liquor to discarded guns; on the\nopposite, stacked cardboard boxes rose above her head.\nOne glance at Hunt and Bryce knew he was thinking the same: the\nViper Queen, mistress of the underworld, feared poisons expert and ruler of\nthe Meat Market, claimed this hovel as an office?\nThe female slid into the chair, interlacing her fingers atop the mess of\npapers strewn across the desk. A computer that was about twenty years out\nof date sat like a fat rock before her, a little statue of Luna poised atop it, the\ngoddess\u2019s bow aimed at the shifter\u2019s face.\nOne of her guards shut the door, prompting Hunt\u2019s hand to slide\ntoward his hip, but Bryce had already taken a seat in one of the cheap\naluminum chairs.\n\u201cNot as fancy as your boss\u2019s place,\u201d the Viper Queen said, reading the\ndisbelief on Bryce\u2019s face, \u201cbut it does the trick.\u201d\nBryce didn\u2019t bother agreeing that the space was far from anything\nbefitting a serpentine shifter whose snake form was a moon-white cobra\nwith scales that gleamed like opals\u2014and whose power was rumored to be\n\u2026 different. Something extra that mixed with her venom, something\nstrange and old.\nHunt took a seat beside her, twisting the chair frontward to\naccommodate his wings. Roaring from the fighting pit rumbled through the\nconcrete floor beneath their feet.\nThe Viper Queen lit another cigarette. \u201cYou\u2019re here to ask about\nDanika Fendyr.\u201d\nBryce kept her face neutral. To his credit, Athalar did, too.\nHunt said carefully, \u201cWe\u2019re trying to get a clearer picture of\neverything.\u201d\nHer remarkable eyes narrowed with pleasure. \u201cIf that\u2019s what you want\nto claim, then sure.\u201d Smoke rippled from her lips. \u201cI\u2019ll spare you the\nbullshit, though. Danika was a threat to me, and in more ways than perhaps\nyou know. But she was smart. Our relationship was a working one.\u201d\nAnother inhale. \u201cI\u2019m sure Athalar can back me up on this,\u201d she drawled,\nearning a warning glare from him, \u201cbut to get shit done, sometimes the Aux\nand 33rd have to work with those of us who dwell in the shadows.\u201d\nHunt said, \u201cAnd Maximus Tertian? He was killed on the outskirts of\nyour territory.\u201d\n\u201cMaximus Tertian was a spoiled little bitch, but I would never be\nstupid enough to pick a fight with his father like that. I\u2019d only stand to gain\na headache.\u201d\n\u201cWho killed him?\u201d Bryce asked. \u201cI heard you pulled in your people.\nYou know something.\u201d\n\u201cJust a precaution.\u201d She flicked her tongue over her bottom teeth. \u201cUs\nserps can taste when shit is about to go down. Like a charge in the air. I can\ntaste it now\u2014all over this city.\u201d\nHunt\u2019s lightning grumbled in the room. \u201cYou didn\u2019t think to warn\nanyone?\u201d\n\u201cI warned my people. As long as trouble doesn\u2019t pass through my\ndistrict, I don\u2019t care what goes on in the rest of Lunathion.\u201d\nHunt said, \u201cReal noble of you.\u201d\nBryce asked again, \u201cWho do you think killed Tertian?\u201d\nShe shrugged. \u201cHonestly? It\u2019s the Meat Market. Shit happens. He was\nprobably coming here for drugs, and this is the price he paid.\u201d\n\u201cWhat kind of drugs?\u201d Bryce asked, but Hunt said, \u201cToxicology report\nsays there were no drugs in his system.\u201d\n\u201cThen I can\u2019t help you,\u201d the shifter said. \u201cYour guess is as good as\nmine.\u201d Bryce didn\u2019t bother to ask about camera footage, not when the 33rd\nwould have already combed through it.\nThe Viper Queen pulled something from a drawer and chucked it on\nthe desk. A flash drive. \u201cMy alibis from the night Tertian was killed and\nfrom the days before and during Danika and her pack\u2019s murders.\u201d\nBryce didn\u2019t touch the tiny metal drive, no bigger than a lipstick tube.\nThe Viper Queen\u2019s lips curved again. \u201cI was at the spa the night of\nTertian\u2019s murder. And as for Danika and the Pack of Devils, one of my\nassociates threw a Drop party for his daughter that night. Turned into three\ndays of \u2026 well, you\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\u201cThis drive contains footage of you at a three-day orgy?\u201d Hunt\ndemanded.\n\u201cLet me know if it gets you hot and bothered, Athalar.\u201d The Viper\nQueen took another hit of the cigarette. Her green eyes drifted toward his\nlap. \u201cI hear you\u2019re one Hel of a ride when you pause the brooding long\nenough.\u201d\nOh please. Hunt\u2019s teeth flashed as he bared them in a silent snarl, so\nBryce said, \u201cOrgy and Hunt\u2019s bedroom prowess aside, you\u2019ve got a salt\nvendor in this market.\u201d She tapped the bag balanced on her knees.\nThe Viper Queen tore her eyes from a still-snarling Hunt and said\nsharply to Bryce, \u201cI don\u2019t use what I sell. Though I don\u2019t think you live by\nthat rule over at your fancy gallery.\u201d She winked. \u201cYou ever get sick of\ncrawling for that sorceress, come find me. I have a stable of clients who\u2019d\ncrawl for you. And pay to do it.\u201d\nHunt\u2019s hand was warm on her shoulder. \u201cShe\u2019s not for sale.\u201d\nBryce leaned out of his grip, throwing him a warning glare.\nThe Viper Queen said, \u201cEveryone, General, is for sale. You just have to\nfigure out the asking price.\u201d Smoke flared from her nostrils, a dragon\nhuffing flames. \u201cGive me a day or two, Athalar, and I\u2019ll figure out yours.\u201d\nHunt\u2019s smile was a thing of deadly beauty. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ve figured out\nyours already.\u201d\nThe Viper Queen smiled. \u201cI certainly hope so.\u201d She stubbed out the\ncigarette and met Bryce\u2019s stare. \u201cHere\u2019s a pro tip for your little\ninvestigation.\u201d Bryce stiffened at the cool mockery. \u201cLook toward where it\nhurts the most. That\u2019s always where the answers are.\u201d\n\u201cThanks for the advice,\u201d Bryce gritted out.\nThe shifter merely snapped her gold-tipped fingers. The office door\nopened, those venom-addicted Fae males peering in. \u201cThey\u2019re done,\u201d the\nViper Queen said, turning on her antique of a computer. \u201cMake sure they\nget outside.\u201d And don\u2019t go poking about.\nBryce shouldered the block of salt as Hunt snatched up the flash drive,\npocketing it.\nThe guard was smart enough to step away as Hunt nudged Bryce\nthrough the door. Bryce made it three steps before the Viper Queen said,\n\u201cDon\u2019t underestimate the obsidian salt, Quinlan. It can bring over the very\nworst of Hel.\u201d\nA chill snaked down her spine. But Bryce merely lifted a hand in an\nover-the-shoulder wave as she entered the hall. \u201cWell, at least I\u2019ll be\nentertained, won\u2019t I?\u201d\nThey left the Meat Market in one piece, thank the five fucking gods\u2014\nespecially Urd herself. Hunt wasn\u2019t entirely sure how they\u2019d managed to\nwalk away from the Viper Queen without their guts pumped full of\npoisoned bullets, but \u2026 He frowned at the red-haired woman now\ninspecting her white scooter for damage. Even the helmet had been left\nuntouched.\nHunt said, \u201cI believe her.\u201d No way in Hel was he watching the video\non that flash drive. He\u2019d be sending it right over to Viktoria. \u201cI don\u2019t think\nshe had anything to do with this.\u201d\nQuinlan and Roga, however \u2026 He hadn\u2019t yet crossed them off his\nmental list.\nBryce tucked the helmet into the crook of her arm. \u201cI agree.\u201d\n\u201cSo that brings us back to square one.\u201d He suppressed the urge to pace,\npicturing his kill count still in the thousands.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Bryce countered. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t.\u201d She fastened the bag of salt into\nthe small compartment on the back of her scooter. \u201cShe said to look where\nit hurts most for answers.\u201d\n\u201cShe was just spewing some bullshit to mess with us.\u201d\n\u201cProbably,\u201d Bryce said, fitting the helmet over her head before flicking\nup the visor to reveal those amber eyes. \u201cBut maybe she was\nunintentionally right. Tomorrow \u2026\u201d Her eyes shuttered. \u201cI\u2019ve got to do\nsome thinking tomorrow. At the gallery, or else Jesiba will throw a fit.\u201d\nHe was intrigued enough that he said, \u201cYou think you have a lead?\u201d\n\u201cNot yet. A general direction, though. It\u2019s better than nothing.\u201d\nHe jerked his chin toward the compartment of her scooter. \u201cWhat\u2019s the\nobsidian salt for?\u201d She had to have another purpose for it. Even if he prayed\nshe wasn\u2019t dumb enough to use it.\nBryce just said blandly, \u201cSeasoning my burgers.\u201d\nFine. He\u2019d walked into that. \u201cHow\u2019d you afford the salt, anyway?\u201d He\ndoubted she had ten grand just sitting around in her bank account.\nBryce zipped up her leather jacket. \u201cI put it on Jesiba\u2019s account. She\nspends more money on beauty products in a month, so I doubt she\u2019ll\nnotice.\u201d\nHunt had no idea how to even respond to any of that, so he gritted his\nteeth and surveyed her atop her ride. \u201cYou know, even a scooter is a dumb\nfucking thing to drive before making the Drop.\u201d\n\u201cThanks, Mom.\u201d\n\u201cYou should take the bus.\u201d\nShe just let out a barking laugh, and zoomed off into the night."}, "20": {"Name": "PART II THE TRENCH-Chapter 20", "Page Content": " 0 \nLook toward where it hurts the most.\nBryce had refrained from telling Athalar how accurate the Viper\nQueen\u2019s tip had been. She\u2019d already given him her list of suspects\u2014but he\nhadn\u2019t asked about the other demand he\u2019d made.\nSo that\u2019s what she\u2019d decided to do: compile a list of every one of\nDanika\u2019s movements from the week before her death. But the moment\nshe\u2019d finished opening up the gallery for the day, the moment she\u2019d come\ndown to the library to make the list \u2026 Nausea had hit her.\nShe turned on her laptop instead, and began combing through her\nemails with Maximus Tertian, dating back six weeks. Perhaps she\u2019d find\nsome sort of connection there\u2014or at least a hint of his plans for that night.\nYet with each professional, bland email she reread, the memories from\nDanika\u2019s last days clawed at the welded-shut door of her mind. Like\nlooming specters, they hissed and whispered, and she tried to ignore them,\ntried to focus on Tertian\u2019s emails, but\u2014\nLehabah looked over from where she\u2019d sprawled on the tiny fainting\ncouch Bryce had given her years ago\u2014courtesy of a dollhouse from her\nchildhood\u2014watching her favorite Vanir drama on her tablet. Her glass\ndome sat behind her atop a stack of books, the plumes of a purple orchid\narching over it. \u201cYou could let the angel down here and work together on\nwhatever is causing you such difficulty.\u201d\nBryce rolled her eyes. \u201cYour fascination with Athalar is taking on\nstalkerish levels.\u201d\nLehabah sighed. \u201cDo you know what Hunt Athalar looks like?\u201d\n\u201cConsidering that he\u2019s living on the roof across from my apartment,\nI\u2019d say yes.\u201d\nLehabah hit pause on her show, leaning her head against the backrest\nof her little fainting couch. \u201cHe\u2019s dreamy.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, just ask him.\u201d Bryce clicked out of the email she\u2019d been\nreading\u2014one of about a hundred between her and Tertian, and the first\nwhere he\u2019d been mildly flirty with her.\n\u201cHunt\u2019s handsome enough to be on this show.\u201d Lehabah pointed with a\ndainty toe toward the tablet propped before her.\n\u201cUnfortunately, I don\u2019t think the size differences between you and\nAthalar would work in the bedroom. You\u2019re barely big enough to wrap your\narms around his dick.\u201d\nSmoke swirled around Lehabah at her puff of embarrassment, and the\nsprite waved her little hands to clear it away. \u201cBB!\u201d\nBryce chuckled, then she gestured to the tablet. \u201cI\u2019m not the one who\u2019s\nbingeing a show that\u2019s basically porn with a plot. What\u2019s it called again?\nFangs and Bangs?\u201d\nLehabah turned purple. \u201cIt\u2019s not called that and you know it! And it\u2019s\nartistic. They make love. They don\u2019t \u2026\u201d She choked.\n\u201cFuck?\u201d Bryce suggested dryly.\n\u201cExactly,\u201d Lehabah said with a prim nod.\nBryce laughed, letting it chase away the swarming ghosts of the past,\nand the sprite, despite her prudishness, joined her. Bryce said, \u201cI doubt Hunt\nAthalar is the making love type.\u201d\nLehabah hid her face behind her hands, humming with mortification.\nJust to torture her a bit more, Bryce added, \u201cHe\u2019s the type to bend you\nover a desk and\u2014\u201d\nThe phone rang.\nShe glanced at the ceiling, wondering if Athalar had somehow heard,\nbut\u2014no. It was worse.\n\u201cHi, Jesiba,\u201d she said, motioning Lehabah back to her guardian\u2019s perch\nin case the sorceress was monitoring through the library\u2019s cameras.\n\u201cBryce. Glad to see Lehabah is hard at work.\u201d\nLehabah quickly shut down the tablet and did her best to look alert.\nBryce said, \u201cIt was her midmorning break. She\u2019s entitled to one.\u201d\nLehabah threw her a grateful glance that cut right to the bone.\nJesiba just began rattling off commands.\nThirty minutes later, at the desk in the gallery showroom, Bryce stared\ntoward the shut front door. The ticking of the clock filled the space, a steady\nreminder of each second lost. Each second that Danika and the pack\u2019s killer\nroamed the streets while she sat in here, checking bullshit paperwork.\nUnacceptable. Yet the thought of prying open the door to those\nmemories \u2026\nShe knew she\u2019d regret it. Knew it was probably ten kinds of stupid.\nBut she dialed the number before she could second-guess it.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong.\u201d Hunt\u2019s voice was already sharp, full of storms.\n\u201cWhy do you assume something\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201cBecause you\u2019ve never called me before, Quinlan.\u201d\nThis was stupid\u2014really fucking stupid. She cleared her throat to make\nup some excuse about ordering food for lunch, but he said, \u201cYou found\nsomething?\u201d\nFor Danika, for the Pack of Devils, she could do this. Would do this.\nPride had no place here. \u201cI need you to \u2026 help me with something.\u201d\n\u201cWith what?\u201d But before his words finished sounding, a fist banged on\nthe door. She knew it was him without pulling up the camera feed.\nShe opened the door, getting a face full of wings and rain-kissed cedar.\nHunt asked wryly, \u201cAre you going to give me shit about coming in or can\nwe spare ourselves that song and dance?\u201d\n\u201cJust get inside.\u201d Bryce left Hunt in the doorway and walked to her\ndesk, where she hauled open the bottom drawer to yank out a reusable\nbottle. She drank straight from it.\nHunt shut the door after himself. \u201cA little early to be drinking, isn\u2019t\nit?\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t bother to correct him, just took another sip and slid into her\nchair.\nHe eyed her. \u201cYou gonna tell me what this is about?\u201d\nA polite but insistent thump-thump-thump came from the iron door\ndown to the library. Hunt\u2019s wings snapped shut as he turned his head toward\nthe heavy metal slab.\nAnother tap-tap-tap filled the showroom atrium. \u201cBB,\u201d Lehabah said\nmournfully through the door. \u201cBB, are you all right?\u201d\nBryce rolled her eyes. Cthona spare her.\nHunt asked too casually, \u201cWho is that?\u201d\nA third little knock-knock-knock. \u201cBB? BB, please say you\u2019re all\nright.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Bryce called. \u201cGo back downstairs and do your job.\u201d\n\u201cI want to see you with my own eyes,\u201d Lehabah said, sounding for all\nthe world like a concerned aunt. \u201cI can\u2019t focus on my work until then.\u201d\nHunt\u2019s brows twitched toward each other\u2014even as his lips tugged\noutward.\nBryce said to him, \u201cOne, hyperbole is an art form for her.\u201d\n\u201cOh, BB, you can be so terribly cruel\u2014\u201d\n\u201cTwo, very few people are allowed downstairs, so if you report to\nMicah about it, we\u2019re done.\u201d\n\u201cI promise,\u201d Hunt said warily. \u201cThough Micah can make me talk if he\ninsists.\u201d\n\u201cThen don\u2019t give him a reason to be curious about it.\u201d She set the\nbottle on her desk, and found her legs were surprisingly sturdy. Hunt still\ntowered over her. The horrible twining thorns tattooed across his brow\nseemed to suck the light from the room.\nBut Hunt rubbed his jaw. \u201cA lot of the stuff down there is contraband,\nisn\u2019t it.\u201d\n\u201cSurely you\u2019ve realized most of the shit in here is contraband. Some of\nthese books and scrolls are the last known copies in existence.\u201d She pursed\nher lips, then added quietly, \u201cA lot of people suffered and died to preserve\nwhat\u2019s in the library downstairs.\u201d\nMore than that, she wouldn\u2019t say. She hadn\u2019t been able to read most of\nthe books, since they were in long-dead languages or in codes so clever\nonly highly trained linguists or historians might decipher them, but she\u2019d\nfinally learned last year what most of them were. Knew the Asteri and the\nSenate would order them destroyed. Had destroyed all other copies. There\nwere normal books in there, too, which Jesiba acquired mostly for her own\nuses\u2014possibly even for the Under-King. But the ones that Lehabah\nguarded \u2026 those were the ones people would kill for. Had killed for.\nHunt nodded. \u201cI won\u2019t breathe a word.\u201d\nShe assessed him for a moment, then turned to the iron door.\n\u201cConsider this your birthday present, Lele,\u201d she muttered through the metal.\nThe iron door opened on a sigh, revealing the pine-green carpeted\nstaircase that led straight down into the library. Hunt almost crashed into\nher as Lehabah floated up between them, her fire shining bright, and purred,\n\u201cHello.\u201d\nThe angel examined the fire sprite hovering a foot away from his face.\nShe was no longer than Bryce\u2019s hand, her flaming hair twirling above her\nhead.\n\u201cWell, aren\u2019t you beautiful,\u201d Hunt said, his voice low and soft in a way\nthat made every instinct in Bryce sit up straight.\nLehabah flared as she wrapped her plump arms around herself and\nducked her head.\nBryce shook off the effects of Hunt\u2019s voice. \u201cStop pretending to be\nshy.\u201d\nLehabah cut her a simmering glare, but Hunt lifted a finger for her to\nperch on. \u201cShall we?\u201d\nLehabah shone ruby red, but floated over to his scarred finger and sat,\nsmiling at him beneath her lashes. \u201cHe is very nice, BB,\u201d Lehabah observed\nas Bryce walked down the stairs, the sun-chandelier blinking to life again.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see why you complain so much about him.\u201d\nBryce scowled over her shoulder. But Lehabah was making mooncalf\neyes at the angel, who gave Bryce a wry smile as he trailed her into the\nlibrary\u2019s heart.\nBryce looked ahead quickly.\nMaybe Lehabah had a point about Athalar\u2019s looks.\nBryce was aware of every step downward, every rustle of Hunt\u2019s wings\nmere steps behind her. Every bit of air that he filled with his breath, his\npower, his will.\nOther than Jesiba, Syrinx, and Lehabah, only Danika had been down\nhere with her before.\nSyrinx stirred enough from his nap to see that they had a guest\u2014and\nhis little lion\u2019s tail whacked against the velvet sofa. \u201cSyrie says you can\nbrush him now,\u201d Lehabah told Hunt.\n\u201cHunt is busy,\u201d Bryce said, heading for the table where she\u2019d left the\nbook open.\n\u201cSyrie talks, does he?\u201d\n\u201cAccording to her, he does,\u201d Bryce muttered, scanning the table for\u2014\nright, she\u2019d put the list on Lehabah\u2019s table. She aimed for it, heels sinking\ndeep into the carpet.\n\u201cThere must be thousands of books in here,\u201d Hunt said, surveying the\ntowering shelves.\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d Lehabah said. \u201cBut half of this is also Jesiba\u2019s private\ncollection. Some of the books date all the way back to\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAhem,\u201d Bryce said.\nLehabah stuck out her tongue and said in a conspiratorial whisper to\nHunt, \u201cBB is cranky because she hasn\u2019t been able to make her list.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m cranky because I\u2019m hungry and you\u2019ve been a pain in my ass all\nmorning.\u201d\nLehabah floated off Hunt\u2019s finger to rush to her table, where she\nplopped on her doll\u2019s couch and said to the angel, who looked torn between\nwincing and laughing, \u201cBB pretends to be mean, but she\u2019s a softie. She\nbought Syrie because Jesiba was going to gift him to a warlord client in the\nFarkaan mountains\u2014\u201d\n\u201cLehabah\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d\nHunt examined the various tanks throughout the room and the\nassortment of reptiles within them, then the empty waters of the massive\naquarium. \u201cI thought he was some designer pet.\u201d\n\u201cOh, he is,\u201d Lehabah said. \u201cSyrinx was stolen from his mother as a\ncub, then traded for ten years around the world, then Jesiba bought him to\nbe her pet, then Bryce bought him\u2014his freedom, I mean. She even had\nproof of his freedom certified. No one can ever buy him again.\u201d She pointed\nto the chimera. \u201cYou can\u2019t see it with him lying down like that, but he\u2019s got\nthe freed brand on his front right paw. The official C and everything.\u201d\nHunt twisted from the gloomy water to look Bryce over.\nShe crossed her arms. \u201cWhat? You did the assuming.\u201d\nHis eyes flickered. Whatever the fuck that meant.\nShe tried not to look at his own wrist, though\u2014the SPQM stamped\nthere. She wondered if he was resisting the same urge; if he was\ncontemplating whether he\u2019d ever get that C one day.\nBut then Lehabah said to Hunt, \u201cHow much do you cost to buy,\nAthie?\u201d\nBryce cut in, \u201cLele, that\u2019s rude. And don\u2019t call him Athie.\u201d\nShe sent up a puff of smoke. \u201cHe and I are of the same House, and are\nboth slaves. My great-grandmother fought in his 18th Legion during their\nrebellion. I am allowed to ask.\u201d\nHunt\u2019s face wholly shuttered at the mention of the rebellion, but he\napproached the couch, let Syrinx sniff his fingers, then scratched the beast\nbehind his velvety ears. Syrinx let out a low growl of pleasure, his lion\u2019s tail\ngoing limp.\nBryce tried to block out the squeezing sensation in her chest at the\nsight of it.\nHunt\u2019s wings rustled. \u201cI was sold to Micah for eighty-five million gold\nmarks.\u201d\nBryce\u2019s heel snagged on the carpet as she reached Lehabah\u2019s little\nstation and grabbed the tablet. Lehabah again floated over to the angel. \u201cI\ncost ninety thousand gold marks,\u201d Lehabah confided. \u201cSyrie was two\nhundred thirty-three thousand gold marks.\u201d\nHunt\u2019s eyes snapped to Bryce. \u201cYou paid that?\u201d\nBryce sat at the worktable and pointed to the empty chair beside hers.\nHunt followed obediently, for once. \u201cI got a fifteen percent employee\ndiscount. And we came to an arrangement.\u201d\nLet that be that.\nUntil Lehabah declared, \u201cJesiba takes some out of each paycheck.\u201d\nBryce growled, reining in the instinct to smother the sprite with a pillow.\n\u201cBB will be paying it off until she\u2019s three hundred. Unless she doesn\u2019t make\nthe Drop. Then she\u2019ll die first.\u201d\nHunt dropped into his seat, his wing brushing her arm. Softer than\nvelvet, smoother than silk. He snapped it in tight at the touch, as if he\ncouldn\u2019t bear the contact. \u201cWhy?\u201d\nBryce said, \u201cBecause that warlord wanted to hurt and break him until\nhe was a fighting beast, and Syrinx is my friend, and I was sick of losing\nfriends.\u201d\n\u201cI thought you were loaded.\u201d\n\u201cNope.\u201d She finished the word on a popping noise.\nHunt\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cBut your apartment\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThe apartment is Danika\u2019s.\u201d Bryce couldn\u2019t meet his gaze. \u201cShe\nbought it as an investment. Had its ownership written in our names. I didn\u2019t\neven know it existed until after she died. And I would have just sold it, but\nit had top-notch security, and grade A enchantments\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI get it,\u201d he said again, and she shrank from the kindness in his eyes.\nThe pity.\nDanika had died, and she was alone, and\u2014Bryce couldn\u2019t breathe.\nShe\u2019d refused to go to therapy. Her mother had set up appointment\nafter appointment for the first year, and Bryce had bailed on all of them.\nShe\u2019d bought herself an aromatherapy diffuser, had read up on breathing\ntechniques, and that had been that.\nShe knew she should have gone. Therapy helped so many people\u2014\nsaved so many lives. Juniper had been seeing a therapist since she was a\nteenager and would tell anyone who would listen about how vital and\nbrilliant it was.\nBut Bryce hadn\u2019t shown up\u2014not because she didn\u2019t believe it would\nwork. No, she knew it would work, and help, and probably make her feel\nbetter. Or at least give her the tools to try to do so.\nThat was precisely why she hadn\u2019t gone.\nFrom the way Hunt was staring at her, she wondered if he knew it\u2014\nrealized why she blew out a long breath.\nLook toward where it hurts the most.\nFucker. The Viper Queen could go to Hel with her pro tips.\nShe turned on Lehabah\u2019s electronic tablet. The screen revealed a\nvampyr and wolf tangled in each other, groaning, naked\u2014\nBryce laughed. \u201cYou stopped watching in the middle of this to come\nbother me, Lele?\u201d\nThe air in the room lightened, as if Bryce\u2019s sorrow had cracked at the\nsight of the wolf pounding into the moaning vampyr female.\nLehabah burned ruby. \u201cI wanted to meet Athie,\u201d she muttered, slinking\nback to her couch.\nHunt, as if despite himself, chuckled. \u201cYou watch Fangs and Bangs?\u201d\nLehabah shot upright. \u201cThat is not what it\u2019s called! Did you tell him to\nsay that, Bryce?\u201d\nBryce bit her lip to keep from laughing and grabbed her laptop instead,\nbringing up her emails with Tertian on the screen. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d\nHunt raised a brow, with that wary amusement.\n\u201cI\u2019m taking a nap with Syrie,\u201d Lehabah declared to no one in\nparticular. Almost as soon as she said it, something heavy thumped on the\nmezzanine.\nHunt\u2019s hand went to his side, presumably for the gun there, but\nLehabah hissed toward the railing, \u201cDo not interrupt my nap.\u201d\nA heavy slithering filled the library, followed by a thump and rustle. It\ndidn\u2019t come from Miss Poppy\u2019s tank.\nLehabah said to Hunt, \u201cDon\u2019t let the books sweet-talk you into taking\nthem home.\u201d\nHe threw her a half smile. \u201cYou\u2019re doing a fine job ensuring that\ndoesn\u2019t happen.\u201d\nLehabah beamed, curling along Syrinx\u2019s side. He purred with delight\nat her warmth. \u201cThey\u2019ll do anything to get out of here: sneak into your bag,\nthe pocket of your coat, even flop up the stairs. They\u2019re desperate to get into\nthe world again.\u201d She flowed toward the distant shelves behind them, where\na book had landed on the steps. \u201cBad!\u201d she seethed.\nHunt\u2019s hand slid within easy reach of the knife at his thigh as the book,\nas if carried by invisible hands, drifted up the steps, floated to the shelf, and\nfound its place again, humming once with golden light\u2014as if in annoyance.\nLehabah cast a warning simmer toward it, then wrapped Syrinx\u2019s tail\naround herself like a fur shawl.\nBryce shook her head, but a sidelong glance told her that Hunt was\nnow staring at her. Not in the way that males tended to stare at her. He said,\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up with all the little critters?\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re Jesiba\u2019s former lovers and rivals,\u201d Lehabah whispered from\nher fur-blanket.\nHunt\u2019s wings rustled. \u201cI\u2019d heard the rumors.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen her transform anyone into an animal,\u201d Bryce said,\n\u201cbut I try to stay on her good side. I\u2019d really prefer not to be turned into a\npig if Jesiba gets pissed at me for fucking up a deal.\u201d\nHunt\u2019s lips twitched upward, as if caught between amusement and\nhorror.\nLehabah opened her mouth, presumably to tell Hunt all the names\nshe\u2019d given the creatures in the library, but Bryce cut her off, saying to\nHunt, \u201cI called you because I started to make that list of all of Danika\u2019s\nmovements during her final days.\u201d She patted the page she\u2019d started writing\non.\n\u201cYeah?\u201d His dark eyes remained on her face.\nBryce cleared her throat and admitted, \u201cIt\u2019s, um, hard. To make myself\nremember. I thought \u2026 maybe you could ask me some questions. Help get\nthe \u2026 memories flowing.\u201d\n\u201cAh. Okay.\u201d Silence rippled again as she waited for him to remind her\nthat time wasn\u2019t on their side, that he had a fucking job to do and she\nshouldn\u2019t be such a wimp, blah blah.\nBut Hunt surveyed the books; the tanks; the door to the bathroom at\nthe back of the space; the lights high above, disguised like the stars painted\nacross the ceiling. And then, rather than ask her about Danika, he said, \u201cDid\nyou study antiquities at school?\u201d\n\u201cI took a few classes, yeah. I liked learning about old crap. I was a\nclassical literature major.\u201d She added, \u201cI learned the Old Language of the\nFae when I was a kid.\u201d She\u2019d taught herself out of a sudden interest in\nlearning more about her heritage. When she\u2019d gone to her father\u2019s house a\nyear later\u2014for the first time in her life\u2014she\u2019d hoped to use it to impress\nhim. After everything went to shit, she\u2019d refused to learn another language.\nChildish, but she didn\u2019t care.\nThough knowing the most ancient of the Fae languages had been\nhelpful for this job, at least. For the few Fae antiquities that weren\u2019t hoarded\nin their glittering troves.\nHunt again surveyed the space. \u201cHow\u2019d you get this job?\u201d\n\u201cAfter I graduated, I couldn\u2019t get a job anywhere. The museums didn\u2019t\nwant me because I didn\u2019t have enough experience, and the other art\ngalleries in town were run by creeps who thought I was \u2026 appetizing.\u201d His\neyes darkened, and she made herself ignore the rage she beheld there on her\nbehalf. \u201cBut my friend Fury \u2026\u201d Hunt stiffened slightly at the name\u2014he\nclearly knew her reputation. \u201cWell, she and Jesiba worked together in\nPangera at some point. And when Jesiba mentioned that she needed a new\nassistant, Fury basically shoved my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 down her throat.\u201d Bryce snorted\nat the memory. \u201cJesiba offered me the job because she didn\u2019t want an\nuptight priss. The work is too dirty, customers too shady. She needed\nsomeone with social skills as well as a little background in ancient art. And\nthat was that.\u201d\nHunt considered, then asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s your deal with Fury Axtar?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s in Pangera. Doing what Fury does best.\u201d It wasn\u2019t really an\nanswer.\n\u201cAxtar ever tell you what she gets up to over there?\u201d\n\u201cNo. And I like it to stay that way. My dad told me enough stories\nabout what it\u2019s like. I don\u2019t enjoy imagining what Fury sees and deals\nwith.\u201d Blood and mud and death, science versus magic, machines versus\nVanir, bombs of chemicals and firstlight, bullets and fangs.\nRandall\u2019s own service had been mandatory, a condition of life for any\nnon-Lower in the peregrini class: all humans had to serve in the military for\nthree years. Randall had never said it, but she\u2019d always known the years on\nthe front had left deep scars beyond those visible on him. Being forced to\nkill your own kind was no small task. But the Asteri\u2019s threat remained:\nShould any refuse, their lives would be forfeit. And then the lives of their\nfamilies. Any survivors would be slaves, their wrists forever inked with the\nsame letters that marred Hunt\u2019s skin.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no chance Danika\u2019s murderer might have been connected to\n\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Bryce growled. She and Fury might be totally fucked up right\nnow, but she knew that. \u201cFury\u2019s enemies weren\u2019t Danika\u2019s enemies. Once\nBriggs was behind bars, she bailed.\u201d Bryce hadn\u2019t seen her since.\nSearching for anything to change the topic, Bryce asked, \u201cHow old are\nyou?\u201d\n\u201cTwo hundred thirty-three.\u201d\nShe did the math, frowning. \u201cYou were that young when you rebelled?\nAnd already commanded a legion?\u201d The angels\u2019 failed rebellion had been\ntwo hundred years ago; he\u2019d have been incredibly young\u2014by Vanir\nstandards\u2014to have led it.\n\u201cMy gifts made me invaluable to people.\u201d He held up a hand, lightning\nwrithing around his fingers. \u201cToo good at killing.\u201d She grunted her\nagreement. Hunt eyed her. \u201cYou ever killed before?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nSurprise lit his eyes. But she didn\u2019t want to go into it\u2014what had\nhappened with Danika senior year that had left them both in the hospital,\nher arm shattered, and a stolen motorcycle little more than scrap.\nLehabah cut in from across the library, \u201cBB, stop being cryptic! I\u2019ve\nwanted to know for years, Athie, but she never tells me anything good\u2014\u201d\n\u201cLeave it, Lehabah.\u201d The memories of that trip pelted her. Danika\u2019s\nsmiling face in the hospital bed beside hers. How Thorne carried Danika up\nthe stairs of their dorm when they got home, despite her protests. How the\npack had fussed over them for a week, Nathalie and Zelda kicking the\nmales out one night so they could have a girls-only moviefest. But none of\nit had compared to what had changed between her and Danika on that trip.\nThe final barrier that had fallen, the truth laid bare.\nI love you, Bryce. I\u2019m so sorry.\nClose your eyes, Danika.\nA hole tore open in her chest, gaping and howling.\nLehabah was still grousing. But Hunt was watching Bryce\u2019s face. He\nasked, \u201cWhat\u2019s one happy memory you have with Danika from the last\nweek of her life?\u201d\nHer blood pounded through her entire body. \u201cI\u2014I have a lot of them\nfrom that week.\u201d\n\u201cPick one, and we\u2019ll start with that.\u201d\n\u201cIs this how you get witnesses to talk?\u201d\nHe leaned back in his seat, wings adjusting around its low back. \u201cIt\u2019s\nhow you and I are going to make this list.\u201d\nShe weighed his stare, his solid, thrumming presence. She swallowed.\n\u201cThe tattoo on my back\u2014she and I got it done that week. We got stupid\ndrunk one night, and I was so out of it I didn\u2019t even know what the fuck she\nput on my back until I\u2019d gotten over my hangover.\u201d\nHis lips twitched. \u201cI hope it was something good, at least.\u201d\nHer chest ached, but she smiled. \u201cIt was.\u201d\nHunt sat forward and tapped the paper. \u201cWrite it down.\u201d\nShe did. He asked, \u201cWhat\u2019d Danika do during that day before you got\nthe tattoo?\u201d\nThe question was calm, but he weighed her every movement. As if he\nwere reading something, assessing something that she couldn\u2019t see.\nEager to avoid that too-aware look, Bryce picked up the pen, and\nbegan writing, one memory after another. Kept writing her recollections of\nDanika\u2019s whereabouts that week: that silly wish on the Old Square Gate, the\npizza she and Danika had devoured while standing at the counter of the\nshop, swigging from bottles of beer and talking shit; the hair salon where\nBryce flipped through gossip magazines while Danika had gotten her\npurple, blue, and pink streaks touched up; the grocery store two blocks\ndown where she and Thorne had found Danika stuffing her face with a bag\nof chips she hadn\u2019t yet paid for and teased her for hours afterward; the CCU\nsunball arena where she and Danika had ogled the hot players on Ithan\u2019s\nteam during practice and called dibs on them \u2026 She kept writing and\nwriting, until the walls pressed in again.\nHer knee bounced relentlessly beneath the table. \u201cI think we can stop\nthere for today.\u201d\nHunt opened his mouth, glancing to the list\u2014but her phone buzzed.\nThanking Urd for the well-timed intervention, Bryce glanced at the\nmessage on the screen and scowled. The expression was apparently\nintriguing enough that Hunt peered over her shoulder.\nRuhn had written, Meet me at Luna\u2019s Temple in thirty minutes.\nHunt asked, \u201cThink it\u2019s got to do with last night?\u201d\nBryce didn\u2019t answer as she typed back, Why?\nRuhn replied. Because it\u2019s one of the few places in this city without\ncameras.\n\u201cInteresting,\u201d she murmured. \u201cYou think I should give him a heads-up\nthat you\u2019re coming?\u201d\nHunt\u2019s grin was pure wickedness. \u201cHel no.\u201d\nBryce couldn\u2019t keep herself from grinning back."}, "21": {"Name": "PART II THE TRENCH-Chapter 21", "Page Content": " 1 \nRuhn Danaan leaned against one of the marble pillars of the inner sanctum\nof Luna\u2019s Temple and waited for his sister to arrive. Tourists drifted past,\nsnapping photos, none marking his presence, thanks to the shadow veil he\u2019d\npulled around himself.\nThe chamber was long, its ceiling lofty. It had to be, to accommodate\nthe statue enthroned at the back.\nThirty feet high, Luna sat in a carved golden throne, the goddess\nlovingly rendered in shimmering moonstone. A silver tiara of a full moon\nheld by two crescent ones graced her upswept curling hair. At her sandaled\nfeet lay twin wolves, their baleful eyes daring any pilgrim to come closer.\nAcross the back of her throne, a bow of solid gold had been slung, its quiver\nfull of silver arrows. The pleats of her thigh-length robe draped across her\nlap, veiling the slim fingers resting there.\nBoth wolves and Fae claimed Luna as their patron goddess\u2014had gone\nto war over whom she favored in millennia long past. And while the\nwolves\u2019 connection to her had been carved into the statue with stunning\ndetail, the nod to the Fae had been missing for two years. Maybe the\nAutumn King had a point about restoring the Fae to glory. Not in the\nhaughty, sneering way his father intended, but \u2026 the lack of Fae heritage\non the statue raked down Ruhn\u2019s nerves.\nFootsteps scuffed in the courtyard beyond the sanctum doors, followed\nby excited whispers and the click of cameras.\n\u201cThe courtyard itself is modeled after the one in the Eternal City,\u201d a\nfemale voice was saying as a new flock of tourists entered the temple,\ntrailing their guide like ducklings.\nAnd at the rear of the group\u2014a wine-red head of hair.\nAnd a too-recognizable pair of gray wings.\nRuhn gritted his teeth, keeping hidden in the shadows. At least she\u2019d\nshown up.\nThe tour group stopped in the center of the inner sanctum, the guide\nspeaking loudly as everyone spread out, cameras flashing like Athalar\u2019s\nlightning in the gloom. \u201cAnd here it is, folks: the statue of Luna herself.\nLunathion\u2019s patron goddess was crafted from a single block of marble hewn\nfrom the famed Caliprian Quarries by the Melanthos River up north. This\ntemple was the first thing built upon the city\u2019s founding five hundred years\nago; the location of this city was selected precisely because of the way the\nIstros River bends through the land. Can anyone tell me what shape the\nriver makes?\u201d\n\u201cA crescent!\u201d someone called out, the words echoing off the marble\npillars, wending through the curling smoke from the bowl of incense laid\nbetween the wolves at the goddess\u2019s feet.\nRuhn saw Bryce and Hunt scan the sanctum for him, and he let the\nshadows peel back long enough for them to spy his location. Bryce\u2019s face\nrevealed nothing. Athalar just grinned.\nFan-fucking-tastic.\nWith all the tourists focused on their guide, no one noticed the unusual\npair crossing the space. Ruhn kept the shadows at bay until Bryce and Hunt\nreached him\u2014and then willed them to encompass them as well.\nHunt just said, \u201cFancy trick.\u201d\nBryce said nothing. Ruhn tried not to remember how delighted she\u2019d\nonce been whenever he\u2019d demonstrated how his shadows and starlight\nworked\u2014both halves of his power working as one.\nRuhn said to her, \u201cI asked you to come. Not him.\u201d\nBryce linked her arm through Athalar\u2019s, the portrait they painted\nlaughable: Bryce in her fancy work dress and heels, the angel in his black\nbattle-suit. \u201cWe\u2019re joined at the hip now, unfortunately for you. Best, best\nfriends.\u201d\n\u201cThe best,\u201d Hunt echoed, his grin unfading.\nLuna shoot him dead. This would not end well.\nBryce nodded to the tour group still trailing their leader through the\ntemple. \u201cThis place might not have any cameras, but they do.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re focused on their guide,\u201d Ruhn said. \u201cAnd the noise they\u2019re\nmaking will mask any conversation we have.\u201d The shadows could only hide\nhim from sight, not sound.\nThrough thin ripples in the shadows, they could make out a young\ncouple edging around the statue, so busy snapping photos they didn\u2019t note\nthe denser bit of darkness in the far corner. But Ruhn fell silent, and Bryce\nand Athalar followed suit.\nAs they waited for the couple to pass, the tour guide went on, \u201cWe\u2019ll\ndive more into the architectural wonders of the inner sanctum in a minute,\nbut let\u2019s direct our attention to the statue. The quiver, of course, is real gold,\nthe arrows pure silver with tips of diamond.\u201d\nSomeone let out an appreciative whistle. \u201cIndeed,\u201d the tour guide\nagreed. \u201cThey were donated by the Archangel Micah, who is a patron and\ninvestor in various charities, foundations, and innovative companies.\u201d The\ntour guide went on, \u201cUnfortunately, two years ago, the third of Luna\u2019s\ntreasures was stolen from this temple. Can anyone tell me what it was?\u201d\n\u201cThe Horn,\u201d someone said. \u201cIt was all over the news.\u201d\n\u201cIt was a terrible theft. An artifact that cannot be replaced easily.\u201d\nThe couple moved on, and Ruhn uncrossed his arms.\nHunt said, \u201cAll right, Danaan. Get to the point. Why\u2019d you ask Bryce\nto come?\u201d\nRuhn gestured to where the tourists were snapping photos of the\ngoddess\u2019s hand. Specifically, the fingers that now curled around air, where a\ncracked ivory hunting horn had once lain.\n\u201cBecause I was tasked by the Autumn King to find Luna\u2019s Horn.\u201d\nAthalar angled his head, but Bryce snorted. \u201cIs that why you asked\nabout it last night?\u201d\nThey were interrupted again by the tour guide saying, as she moved\ntoward the rear of the room, \u201cIf you\u2019ll follow me, we\u2019ve been granted\nspecial permission to see the chamber where the stag sacrifices are prepared\nto be burned in Luna\u2019s honor.\u201d Through the murky shadows, Bryce could\nmake out a small door opening in the wall.\nWhen they\u2019d filtered out, Hunt asked, eyes narrowing, \u201cWhat is the\nHorn, exactly?\u201d\n\u201cA bunch of fairy-tale bullcrap,\u201d Bryce muttered. \u201cYou really dragged\nme here for this? To what\u2014help you impress your daddy?\u201d\nGrowling, Ruhn pulled out his phone, making sure the shadows held\naround them, and brought up the photos he\u2019d snapped in the Fae Archives\nlast night.\nBut he didn\u2019t share them, not before he said to Athalar, \u201cLuna\u2019s Horn\nwas a weapon wielded by Pelias, the first Starborn Prince, during the First\nWars. The Fae forged it in their home world, named it for the goddess in\ntheir new one, and used it to battle the demon hordes once they made the\nCrossing. Pelias wielded the Horn until he died.\u201d Ruhn put a hand on his\nchest. \u201cMy ancestor\u2014whose power flows in my veins. I don\u2019t know how it\nworked, how Pelias used it with his magic, but the Horn became enough of\na nuisance for the demon princes that they did everything they could to\nretrieve it from him.\u201d\nRuhn held out his phone, the picture of the illuminated manuscript\nglaringly bright in the thick shadows. The illustration of the carved horn\nlifted to the lips of a helmeted Fae male was as pristine as it had been when\ninked millennia ago. Above the figure gleamed an eight-pointed star, the\nemblem of the Starborn.\nBryce went wholly still. The stillness of the Fae, like a stag halting in a\nwood.\nRuhn went on, \u201cThe Star-Eater himself bred a new horror just to hunt\nthe Horn, using some blood he managed to spill from Prince Pelias on a\nbattlefield and his own terrible essence. A beast twisted out of the collision\nof light and darkness.\u201d Ruhn swiped on his phone, and the next illustration\nappeared. The reason he\u2019d had her come here\u2014had taken this gamble.\nBryce recoiled at the grotesque, pale body, the clear teeth bared in a\nroar.\n\u201cYou recognize it,\u201d Ruhn said softly.\nBryce shook herself, as if to bring herself back to reality, and rubbed\nher thigh absently. \u201cThat\u2019s the demon I found attacking the angel in the\nalley on that night.\u201d\nHunt gave her a sharp look. \u201cThe one that attacked you, too?\u201d\nBryce gave a small, affirmative nod. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u201cIt dwells in the darkest depths of the Pit,\u201d Ruhn answered. \u201cSo\nlightless that the Star-Eater named it the kristallos, for its clear blood and\nteeth.\u201d\nAthalar said, \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of it.\u201d\nBryce contemplated the drawing. \u201cIt \u2026 There was never a mention of\na fucking demon in the research I did on the Horn.\u201d She met his gaze. \u201cNo\none put this together two years ago?\u201d\n\u201cI think it\u2019s taken two years to put it together,\u201d Ruhn said carefully.\n\u201cThis volume was deep in the Fae Archives, with the stuff that\u2019s not\nallowed to be scanned. None of your research would have ever pulled it up.\nThe entire damn thing was in the Old Language of the Fae.\u201d And had taken\nhim most of the night to translate. Throwing in the lingering fog of the\nmirthroot hadn\u2019t helped.\nBryce\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cBut the Horn was broken\u2014it basically\nbecame a dud, right?\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d Ruhn said. \u201cDuring the final battle of the First Wars, Prince\nPelias and the Prince of the Pit faced each other. The two of them fought for\nlike three fucking days, until the Star-Eater struck the fatal blow. But not\nbefore Pelias was able to summon all the Horn\u2019s strength, and banished the\nPrince of the Pit, his brethren, and their armies back to Hel. He sealed the\nNorthern Rift forever\u2014so only small cracks in it or summonings with salt\ncan bring them over now.\u201d\nAthalar frowned. \u201cSo you mean to tell me this deadly artifact, which\nthe Prince of the Pit literally bred a new demon species to hunt, was just\nsitting here? In this temple? And no one from this world or Hel tried to take\nit until that blackout? Why?\u201d\nBryce met Hunt\u2019s disbelieving stare. \u201cThe Horn cracked in two when\nPelias sealed the Northern Rift. Its power was broken. The Fae and Asteri\ntried for years to renew it through magic and spells and all that crap, but no\nluck. It was given a place of honor in the Asteri Archives, but when they\nestablished Lunathion a few millennia later, they had it dedicated to the\ntemple here.\u201d\nRuhn shook his head. \u201cThat the Fae allowed for the artifact to be given\nover suggests they\u2019d dismissed its worth\u2014that even my father might have\nforgotten its importance.\u201d Until it was stolen\u2014and he\u2019d gotten it into his\nhead that it would be a rallying symbol of power during a possible war.\nBryce added, \u201cI thought it was just a replica until Jesiba made me start\nlooking for it.\u201d She turned to Ruhn. \u201cSo you think someone has been\nsummoning this demon to hunt for the Horn? But why, when it no longer\nhas any power? And how does it explain any of the deaths? You think the\nvictims somehow \u2026 had contact with the Horn, and it brought the kristallos\nright to them?\u201d She went on before either of them could answer, \u201cAnd why\nthe two-year gap?\u201d\nHunt mused, \u201cMaybe the murderer waited until things calmed down\nenough to resume searching.\u201d\n\u201cYour guess is as good as mine,\u201d Ruhn admitted. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like\ncoincidence that the Horn went missing right before this demon showed up,\nthough, and for the murders to be starting again\u2014\u201d\n\u201cCould mean someone is hunting for the Horn once more,\u201d Bryce\nfinished, frowning.\nHunt said, \u201cThe kristallos\u2019s presence in Lunathion suggests the Horn is\nstill inside the city walls.\u201d\nBryce pinned Ruhn with a look. \u201cWhy does the Autumn King\nsuddenly want it?\u201d\nRuhn chose his words carefully. \u201cCall it pride. He wants it returned to\nthe Fae. And wants me to find it quietly.\u201d\nAthalar asked him, \u201cBut why ask you to look for the Horn?\u201d\nThe shadows veiling them rippled. \u201cBecause Prince Pelias\u2019s Starborn\npower was woven into the Horn itself. And it\u2019s in my blood. My father\nthinks I might have some sort of preternatural gift to find it.\u201d He admitted,\n\u201cWhen I was browsing the Archives last night, this book \u2026 jumped out at\nme.\u201d\n\u201cLiterally?\u201d Bryce asked, brows high.\nRuhn said, \u201cIt just felt like it \u2026 shimmered. I don\u2019t fucking know. All\nI know is I was down there for hours, and then I sensed the book, and when\nI saw that illustration of the Horn \u2026 There it was. The crap I translated\nconfirmed it.\u201d\n\u201cSo the kristallos can track the Horn,\u201d Bryce said, eyes glittering. \u201cBut\nso can you.\u201d\nAthalar\u2019s mouth curled in a crooked grin, catching Bryce\u2019s drift. \u201cWe\nfind the demon, we find who\u2019s behind this. And if we have the Horn \u2026\u201d\nRuhn grimaced. \u201cThe kristallos will come to us.\u201d\nBryce glanced to the empty-handed statue behind them. \u201cBetter get\ncracking, Ruhn.\u201d\nHunt leaned against the entry pillars atop the steps leading into Luna\u2019s\nTemple, his phone at his ear. He\u2019d left Quinlan inside with her cousin,\nneeding to make this phone call before they could sort out logistics. He\nwould have made the call right there, but the moment he\u2019d pulled up his\ncontacts list, he\u2019d earned a snipe from Bryce about mobile phones in sacred\nspaces.\nCthona spare him. Declining to tell her to fuck off, he\u2019d decided to\nspare them a public scene and stalked out through the cypress-lined\ncourtyard and to the front steps.\nFive temple acolytes emerged from the sprawling villa behind the\ntemple itself, bearing brooms and hoses to clean the temple steps and the\nflagstones beyond it for their midday washing.\nUnnecessary, he wanted to tell the young females. With the misting\nrain yet again gracing the city, the hoses were superfluous.\nTeeth gritted, he listened to the phone ring and ring. \u201cPick the fuck\nup,\u201d he muttered.\nA dark-skinned temple acolyte\u2014black-haired, white-robed, and no\nmore than twelve\u2014gaped at him as she walked past, clutching a broom to\nher chest. He nearly winced, realizing the portrait of wrath he now\npresented, and checked his expression.\nThe Fae girl still kept back, the golden crescent moon dangling from a\ndelicate chain across her brow glinting in the gray light. A waxing moon\u2014\nuntil she became a full-fledged priestess upon reaching maturity, when she\nwould trade the crescent for the full circle of Luna. And whenever her\nimmortal body began to age and fade, her cycle vanishing with it, she\nwould again trade the charm, this time for a waning crescent.\nThe priestesses all had their own reasons for offering themselves to\nLuna. For forsaking their lives beyond the temple grounds and embracing\nthe goddess\u2019s eternal maidenhood. Just as Luna had no mate or lover, so\nthey would live.\nHunt had always thought celibacy seemed like a bore. Until Shahar\nhad ruined him for anyone else.\nHunt offered the shrinking acolyte his best attempt at a smile. To his\nsurprise, the Fae girl offered a small one back. The girl had courage.\nJustinian Gelos answered on the sixth ring. \u201cHow\u2019s babysitting?\u201d\nHunt straightened. \u201cDon\u2019t sound so amused.\u201d\nJustinian huffed a laugh. \u201cYou sure Micah\u2019s not punishing you?\u201d\nHunt had considered the question a great deal in the past two days.\nAcross the empty street, the palm trees dotting the rain-soft grasses of the\nOracle\u2019s Park shone in the gray light, the domed onyx building of the\nOracle\u2019s Temple veiled in the mists that had rolled in over the river.\nEven at midday, the Oracle\u2019s Park was near-empty, save for the\nhunched, slumbering forms of the desperate Vanir and humans who\nwandered the paths and gardens, waiting for their turn to enter the incense-\nfilled hallways.\nAnd if the answers they sought weren\u2019t what they\u2019d hoped \u2026 Well, the\nwhite-stoned temple on whose steps Hunt now stood could offer some\nsolace.\nHunt glanced over his shoulder to the dim temple interior just visible\nthrough the towering bronze doors. In the firstlight from a row of\nshimmering braziers, he could just barely make out the gleam of red hair in\nthe quiet gloom of the inner sanctum, shining like molten metal as Bryce\ntalked animatedly with Ruhn.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Hunt said at last. \u201cI don\u2019t think this assignment was punishment.\nHe was out of options and knew I\u2019d cause more trouble if he stationed me\non guard duty around Sandriel.\u201d And Pollux.\nHe didn\u2019t mention the bargain he\u2019d struck with Micah. Not when\nJustinian bore the halo as well and Micah had never shown much interest in\nhim beyond his popularity with the grunt troops of the 33rd. If there was\nany sort of deal to earn his freedom, Justinian had never said a word.\nJustinian blew out a breath. \u201cYeah\u2014shit\u2019s getting intense around here\nright now. People are on edge and she hasn\u2019t even arrived yet. You\u2019re better\noff where you are.\u201d\nA glassy-eyed Fae male stumbled past the steps of the temple, got a\ngood look at who was barring entry into the temple itself\u2014and aimed for\nthe street, staggering toward the Oracle\u2019s Park and the domed building in its\nheart. Another lost soul looking for answers in smoke and whispers.\n\u201cI\u2019m not so sure of that,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cI need you to look up something\nfor me\u2014an old-school demon. The kristallos. Just search through the\ndatabases and see if anything pops up.\u201d He\u2019d have asked Vik, but she was\nalready busy going through the alibi footage from the Viper Queen.\n\u201cI\u2019ll get on it,\u201d Justinian said. \u201cI\u2019ll message over any results.\u201d He\nadded, \u201cGood luck.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll need it,\u201d Hunt admitted. In a hundred fucking ways.\nJustinian added slyly, \u201cThough it doesn\u2019t hurt that your partner is easy\non the eyes.\u201d\n\u201cI gotta go.\u201d\n\u201cNo one gets a medal for suffering the most, you know,\u201d Justinian\npushed, his voice slipping into uncharacteristic seriousness. \u201cIt\u2019s been two\ncenturies since Shahar died, Hunt.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever.\u201d He didn\u2019t want to have this conversation. Not with\nJustinian or anyone.\n\u201cIt\u2019s admirable that you\u2019re still holding out for her, but let\u2019s be realistic\nabout\u2014\u201d\nHunt hung up. Debated throwing his phone against a pillar.\nHe had to call Isaiah and Micah about the Horn. Fuck. When it had\ngone missing two years ago, top inspectors from the 33rd and the Aux had\ncombed this temple. They\u2019d found nothing. And since no cameras were\nallowed within the temple walls, there had been no hint of who might have\ntaken it. It had been nothing more than a stupid prank, everyone had\nclaimed.\nEveryone except for the Autumn King, it seemed.\nHunt hadn\u2019t paid much attention to the theft of the Horn, and sure as\nfuck hadn\u2019t listened during history lessons as a boy about the First Wars.\nAnd after Danika\u2019s and the Pack of Devils\u2019 murders, they\u2019d had bigger\nthings to worry about.\nHe couldn\u2019t tell what was worse: the Horn possibly being a vital piece\nof this case, or the fact that he\u2019d now have to work alongside Ruhn Danaan\nto find it."}, "22": {"Name": "PART II THE TRENCH-Chapter 22", "Page Content": " 2 \nBryce waited until Hunt\u2019s muscled back and beautiful wings had\ndisappeared through the inner sanctum\u2019s gates before she whirled on Ruhn.\n\u201cDid the Autumn King do it?\u201d\nRuhn\u2019s blue eyes glimmered in his shadow-nest or whatever the fuck\nhe called it. \u201cNo. He\u2019s a monster in so many ways, but he wouldn\u2019t kill\nDanika.\u201d\nShe\u2019d come to that conclusion the other night, but she asked, \u201cHow\ncan you be so sure? You have no idea what the Hel his long-term agenda\nis.\u201d\nRuhn crossed his arms. \u201cWhy ask me to hunt for the Horn if he\u2019s\nsummoning the kristallos?\u201d\n\u201cTwo trackers are better than one?\u201d Her heart thundered.\n\u201cHe\u2019s not behind this. He\u2019s just trying to take advantage of the\nsituation\u2014to restore the Fae to their former glory. You know how he likes\nto delude himself with that kind of crap.\u201d\nBryce trailed her fingers through the wall of shadows, the darkness\nrunning over her skin like mist. \u201cDoes he know you came to meet with\nme?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nShe held her brother\u2019s stare. \u201cWhy \u2026\u201d She struggled for words. \u201cWhy\nbother?\u201d\n\u201cBecause I want to help you. Because this shit puts the entire city at\nrisk.\u201d\n\u201cHow very Chosen One of you.\u201d\nSilence stretched between them, so taut it trembled. She blurted, \u201cJust\nbecause we\u2019re working together doesn\u2019t mean anything changes between\nus. You\u2019ll find the Horn, and I\u2019ll find who\u2019s behind this. End of story.\u201d\n\u201cFine,\u201d Ruhn said, his eyes cold. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect you to consider\nlistening to me anyway.\u201d\n\u201cWhy would I listen to you?\u201d she seethed. \u201cI\u2019m just a half-breed slut,\nright?\u201d\nRuhn stiffened, a flush flaring. \u201cYou know it was a dumb fight and I\ndidn\u2019t mean that\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes, you fucking did,\u201d she spat, and turned on her heel. \u201cYou might\ndress like you\u2019re a punk rebelling against Daddy\u2019s rules, but deep down,\nyou\u2019re no better than the rest of the Fae shitheads who kiss your Chosen\nOne ass.\u201d\nRuhn snarled, but Bryce didn\u2019t wait before shoving through the\nshadows, blinking at the flood of light that greeted her, and aiming for\nwhere Hunt had paused at the doors.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d she said. She didn\u2019t care what he\u2019d overheard.\nHunt lingered in place, his black eyes flickering as he gazed toward the\nshadowed back of the room, where her so-called cousin was again veiled in\ndarkness. But the angel thankfully said nothing as he fell into step beside\nher, and she said nothing more to him.\nBryce practically ran back to the gallery. In part to start researching the\nHorn again, but also thanks to the flurry of messages from Jesiba,\ndemanding to know where she was, whether she still wanted her job, and\nwhether she\u2019d prefer to be turned into a rat or a pigeon. And then an order\nto get back now to greet a client.\nFive minutes after Bryce got there, Jesiba\u2019s client\u2014a raging asshole of\na leopard shifter who believed he was entitled to put his paws all over her\nass\u2014prowled in and purchased a small statue of Solas and Cthona,\nportrayed as a sun with male features burying his face in a pair of\nmountain-shaped breasts. The holy image was known simply as the\nEmbrace. Her mother even wore its simplified symbol\u2014a circle nestled\natop two triangles\u2014as a silver pendant. But Bryce had always found the\nEmbrace cheesy and clich\u00e9 in every incarnation. Thirty minutes and two\nblatant rejections to his slimy come-ons later, Bryce was mercifully alone\nagain.\nBut in the hours she looked, the gallery\u2019s databases for Luna\u2019s Horn\nrevealed nothing beyond what she already knew, and what her brother had\nclaimed that morning. Even Lehabah, gossip queen extraordinaire, didn\u2019t\nknow anything about the Horn.\nWith Ruhn heading back to the Fae Archives to see if any more\ninformation appealed to his Starborn sensibilities, she supposed she\u2019d have\nto wait for an update.\nHunt had gone to take watch on the roof, apparently needing to make\ncalls to his boss\u2014or whatever Micah pretended he was\u2014and Isaiah\nregarding the Horn. He hadn\u2019t tried to come back down to the library, as if\nsensing she needed space.\nLook toward where it hurts the most. That\u2019s always where the answers\nare.\nBryce found herself staring down at the half-finished list she\u2019d started\nthat morning.\nShe might not be able to find much on the Horn itself, but maybe she\ncould figure out how the Hel Danika factored into all of it.\nHands shaking, she made herself finish the list of Danika\u2019s locations\u2014\nas far as she knew.\nBy the time the sun was near setting, and Syrinx was ready to be\nwalked home, Bryce would have traded what was left of her soul to a\nReaper just for the quiet comfort of her bed. It had been a long fucking day,\nfull of information she needed to process, and a list that she\u2019d left in her\ndesk drawer.\nIt must have been a long day for Athalar, too, because he trailed her\nand Syrinx from the skies without saying a word to her.\nShe was in bed by eight, and didn\u2019t even remember falling asleep."}, "23": {"Name": "PART II THE TRENCH-Chapter 23", "Page Content": " 3 \nThe next morning, Bryce was sitting at the reception desk in the gallery\u2019s\nshowroom, staring at her list of Danika\u2019s last locations, when her phone\nrang.\n\u201cThe deal with the leopard went through,\u201d she said to Jesiba by way of\ngreeting. The paperwork had been finalized an hour ago.\n\u201cI need you to go up into my office and send me a file from my\ncomputer.\u201d\nBryce rolled her eyes, refraining from snipping, You\u2019re welcome, and\nasked, \u201cYou don\u2019t have access to it?\u201d\n\u201cI made sure this one wasn\u2019t on the network.\u201d\nNostrils flaring, Bryce rose, her leg throbbing slightly, and walked to\nthe small door in the wall adjacent to the desk. A hand on the metal panel\nbeside it had the enchantments unlocking, the door swinging open to reveal\nthe tight, carpeted staircase upward.\n\u201cWhen I want things done, Bryce, you\u2019re to do them. No questions.\u201d\n\u201cYes, Jesiba,\u201d Bryce muttered, climbing the stairs. Dodging the\nreaching hands of the leopard shifter yesterday had twinged something in\nher bad leg.\n\u201cWould you like to be a worm, Bryce?\u201d Jesiba purred, voice sliding\ninto something eerily close to a Reaper\u2019s rasp. At least Jesiba wasn\u2019t one of\nthem\u2014even if Bryce knew the sorceress often dealt with them in the House\nof Flame and Shadow. Thank the gods none had ever shown up at the\ngallery, though. \u201cWould you like to be a dung beetle or a centipede?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d prefer to be a dragonfly.\u201d Bryce entered the small, plush office\nupstairs. One wall was a pane of glass that overlooked the gallery floor a\nlevel below, the material utterly soundproof.\n\u201cBe careful what you ask of me,\u201d Jesiba went on. \u201cYou\u2019d find that\nsmart mouth of yours shut up fairly quickly if I transform you. You\nwouldn\u2019t have any voice at all.\u201d\nBryce calculated the time difference between Lunathion and the\nwestern shores of Pangera and realized Jesiba had probably just come back\nfrom dinner. \u201cThat Pangeran red wine is heady stuff, isn\u2019t it?\u201d She was\nalmost to the wooden desk when the firstlights flicked on. A rack of them\nilluminated the dismantled gun hanging on the wall behind the desk, the\nGodslayer Rifle gleaming as fresh as it had the day it\u2019d been forged. She\ncould have sworn a faint whine radiated from the gold and steel\u2014like the\nlegendary, lethal gun was still ringing after a shot.\nIt unnerved her that it was in here, despite the fact that Jesiba had split\nit into four pieces, mounted like a work of art behind her desk. Four pieces\nthat could still be easily assembled, but it put her clients at ease, even while\nit reminded them that she was in charge.\nBryce knew the sorceress never told them about the six-inch engraved\ngolden bullet in the safe beside the painting on the right wall. Jesiba had\nshown it to her just once, letting her read the words etched onto the bullet:\nMemento Mori.\nThe same words that appeared in the mosaic in the Meat Market.\nIt\u2019d seemed melodramatic, but some part of her had marveled at it\u2014at\nthe bullet and at the rifle, so rare only a few existed in Midgard.\nBryce powered up Jesiba\u2019s computer, letting the female rattle off\ninstructions before sending the file. Bryce was halfway down the stairs\nagain when she asked her boss, \u201cHave you heard anything new about\nLuna\u2019s Horn?\u201d\nA long, contemplative pause. \u201cDoes it have to do with this\ninvestigation of yours?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d\nJesiba\u2019s low, cold voice was an embodiment of the House she served.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t heard anything.\u201d Then she hung up. Bryce gritted her teeth as she\nheaded back to her desk on the showroom floor.\nLehabah interrupted her by whispering through the iron door, \u201cCan I\nsee Athie now?\u201d\n\u201cNo, Lele.\u201d\nHe\u2019d kept his distance this morning, too. Good.\nLook toward where it hurts the most.\nShe had her list of Danika\u2019s locations. Unfortunately, she knew what\nshe had to do next. What she\u2019d woken up this morning dreading. Her phone\nrang in her clenched hand, and Bryce steeled herself for Jesiba calling to\nbitch that she\u2019d fucked up the file, but it was Hunt.\n\u201cYeah?\u201d she asked by way of greeting.\n\u201cThere\u2019s been another murder.\u201d His voice was tight\u2014cold.\nShe nearly dropped the phone. \u201cWho\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m still getting the details. But it was about ten blocks from here\u2014\nnear the Gate in the Old Square.\u201d\nHer heart beat so fast she could scarcely draw breath to say, \u201cAny\nwitnesses?\u201d\n\u201cNo. But let\u2019s go over there.\u201d\nHer hands shook. \u201cI\u2019m busy,\u201d she lied.\nHunt paused. \u201cI\u2019m not fucking around, Quinlan.\u201d\nNo. No, she couldn\u2019t do it, endure it, see it again\u2014\nBryce forced herself to breathe, practically inhaling the peppermint\nvapors from the diffuser. \u201cThere\u2019s a client coming\u2014\u201d\nHe banged on the gallery door, sealing her fate. \u201cWe\u2019re leaving.\u201d\nBryce\u2019s entire body was taut to the point of near-trembling as she and Hunt\napproached the magi-screens blocking the alley a few blocks away from the\nOld Square Gate.\nShe tried to breathe through it, tried all the techniques she\u2019d read and\nheard about regarding reining in her dread, that sickening plunging feeling\nin her stomach. None of them worked.\nAngels and Fae and shifters milled about the alley, some on radios or\nphones.\n\u201cA jogger found the remains,\u201d Hunt said as people parted to let him\npass. \u201cThey think it happened sometime last night.\u201d He added carefully,\n\u201cThe 33rd\u2019s still working on getting an ID, but from the clothes, it looks\nlike an acolyte from Luna\u2019s Temple. Isaiah is already asking the temple\npriestesses who might be missing.\u201d\nAll sounds turned into a blaring drone. She didn\u2019t entirely remember\nthe walk over.\nHunt edged around the magi-screen blocking the crime scene from\nview, took one look at what lay there, and swore. He whirled toward her, as\nif realizing what he was dragging her back into, but too late.\nBlood had splashed across the bricks of the building, pooled on the\ncracked stones of the alley floor, splattered on the sides of the dumpster.\nAnd beside that dumpster, as if someone had chucked them out of a bucket,\nsat clumps of red pulp. A torn robe lay beside the carnage.\nThe droning turned into a roar. Her body pulled farther away.\nDanika howling with laughter, Connor winking at her, Bronson and\nZach and Zelda and Nathalie and Thorne all in hysterics\u2014\nThen nothing but red pulp. All of them, all they had been, all she had\nbeen with them, became nothing more than piles of red pulp.\nGone, gone, gone\u2014\nA hand gripped her shoulder. But not Athalar\u2019s. No, Hunt remained\nwhere he was, face now hard as stone.\nShe flinched as Ruhn said at her ear, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to see this.\u201d\nThis was another murder. Another body. Another year.\nA medwitch even knelt before the body, a wand buzzing with firstlight\nin her hands, trying to piece the corpse\u2014the girl\u2014back together.\nRuhn tugged her away, toward the screen and open air beyond\u2014\nThe movement shook her loose. Snapped the droning in her ears.\nShe yanked her body free from his grip, not caring if anyone else saw,\nnot caring that he, as head of the Fae Aux units, had the right to be here.\n\u201cDon\u2019t fucking touch me.\u201d\nRuhn\u2019s mouth tightened. But he looked over her shoulder to Hunt.\n\u201cYou\u2019re an asshole.\u201d\nHunt\u2019s eyes glittered. \u201cI warned her on the walk over what she\u2019d see.\u201d\nHe added a touch ruefully, \u201cI didn\u2019t realize what a mess it\u2019d be.\u201d He had\nwarned her, hadn\u2019t he? She\u2019d drifted so far away that she\u2019d barely listened\nto Hunt on the walk. As dazed as if she\u2019d snorted a heap of lightseeker.\nHunt added, \u201cShe\u2019s a grown woman. She doesn\u2019t need you deciding what\nshe can handle.\u201d He nodded toward the alley exit. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be\nresearching? We\u2019ll call you if you\u2019re needed, princeling.\u201d\n\u201cFuck you,\u201d Ruhn shot back, shadows twining through his hair. Others\nwere noticing now. \u201cYou don\u2019t think it\u2019s more than a coincidence that an\nacolyte was killed right after we went to the temple?\u201d\nTheir words didn\u2019t register. None of it registered.\nBryce turned from the alley, the swarming investigators. Ruhn said,\n\u201cBryce\u2014\u201d\n\u201cLeave me alone,\u201d she said quietly, and kept walking. She shouldn\u2019t\nhave let Athalar bully her into coming, shouldn\u2019t have seen this, shouldn\u2019t\nhave had to remember.\nOnce, she might have gone right to the dance studio. Would have\ndanced and moved until the world made sense again. It had always been her\nhaven, her way of puzzling out the world. She\u2019d gone to the studio\nwhenever she\u2019d had a shit day.\nIt had been two years since she\u2019d set foot in one. She\u2019d thrown out all\nher dance clothes and shoes. Her bags. The one at the apartment had all\nbeen splattered with blood anyway\u2014Danika\u2019s, Connor\u2019s, and Thorne\u2019s on\nthe clothes in the bedroom, and Zelda\u2019s and Bronson\u2019s on her secondary\nbag, which had been left hanging beside the door. Blood patterns just like\u2014\nA rain-kissed scent brushed her nose as Hunt fell into step beside her.\nAnd there he was. Another memory from that night.\n\u201cHey,\u201d Hunt said.\nHey, he\u2019d said to her, so long ago. She\u2019d been a wreck, a ghost, and\nthen he\u2019d been there, kneeling beside her, those dark eyes unreadable as\nhe\u2019d said, Hey.\nShe hadn\u2019t told him\u2014that she remembered that night in the\ninterrogation room. She sure as Hel didn\u2019t feel like telling him now.\nIf she had to talk to someone, she\u2019d explode. If she had to do anything\nright now, she\u2019d sink into one of those primal Fae wraths and\u2014\nThe haze started to creep over her vision, her muscles seizing\npainfully, her fingertips curled as if imagining shredding into someone\u2014\n\u201cWalk it off,\u201d Hunt murmured.\n\u201cLeave me alone, Athalar.\u201d She wouldn\u2019t look at him. Couldn\u2019t stand\nhim or her brother or anyone.

Hunt didn\u2019t falter\nfor a beat.\nShe wouldn\u2019t cry. Wouldn\u2019t dissolve into a hyperventilating mess on\nthe street corner. Wouldn\u2019t scream or puke or\u2014\nAfter another block, Hunt said roughly, \u201cI was there that night.\u201d\nShe kept walking, her heels eating up the pavement.\nHunt asked, \u201cHow did you survive the kristallos?\u201d\nHe\u2019d no doubt been looking at the body just now and wondering this.\nHow did she, a pathetic half-breed, survive when full-blooded Vanir hadn\u2019t?\n\u201cI didn\u2019t survive,\u201d she mumbled, crossing a street and edging around a\ncar idling in the intersection. \u201cIt got away.\u201d\n\u201cBut the kristallos pinned Micah, ripped open his chest\u2014\u201d\nShe nearly tripped over the curb, and whipped around to gape at him.\n\u201cThat was Micah?\u201d"}, "24": {"Name": "PART II THE TRENCH-Chapter 24", "Page Content": " 4 \nShe had saved Micah Domitus that night.\nNot some random legionary, but the gods-damned Archangel himself.\nNo wonder the emergency responder had launched into action when he\ntraced the phone number.\nThe knowledge rippled through her, warping and clearing some of the\nfog around her memories. \u201cI saved the Governor in the alley.\u201d\nHunt just gave her a slow, wincing nod.\nHer voice sharpened. \u201cWhy was it a secret?\u201d\nHunt waited until a flock of tourists had passed before saying, \u201cFor his\nsake. If word got out that the Governor had his ass handed to him, it\nwouldn\u2019t have looked good.\u201d\n\u201cEspecially when he was saved by a half-breed?\u201d\n\u201cNo one in our group ever used that term\u2014you know that, right? But\nyes. We did consider how it\u2019d look if a twenty-three-year-old human-Fae\nfemale who hadn\u2019t made the Drop had saved the Archangel when he\ncouldn\u2019t save himself.\u201d\nHer blood roared in her ears. \u201cWhy not tell me, though? I looked in all\nthe hospitals, just to see if he\u2019d made it.\u201d More than that, actually. She\u2019d\ndemanded answers about how the warrior was recovering, but she\u2019d been\nput on hold or ignored or asked to leave.\n\u201cI know,\u201d Hunt said, scanning her face. \u201cIt was deemed wiser to keep\nit a secret. Especially when your phone got hacked right after\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSo I was just going to live in ignorance forever\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDid you want a medal or something? A parade?\u201d\nShe halted so quickly that Hunt had to splay his wings to pause, too.\n\u201cGo fuck yourself. What I wanted \u2026\u201d She tried to stop the sharp, jagged\nbreaths that blinded her, built and built under her skin\u2014 \u201cWhat I wanted,\u201d\nshe hissed, resuming her walk as he just stared at her, \u201cwas to know that\nsomething I did made a difference that night. I assumed you\u2019d dumped him\nin the Istros\u2014some legionary grunt not worth the honor of a Sailing.\u201d\nHunt shook his head. \u201cLook, I know it was shitty. And I\u2019m sorry,\nokay? I\u2019m sorry for all of it, Quinlan. I\u2019m sorry we didn\u2019t tell you, and I\u2019m\nsorry you\u2019re on my suspect list, and I\u2019m sorry\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m on your what?\u201d she spat. Red washed over her vision as she bared\nher teeth. \u201cAfter all of this,\u201d she seethed, \u201cyou think I am a fucking\nsuspect?\u201d She screamed the last words, only pure will keeping her from\nleaping on him and shredding his face off.\nHunt held up his hands. \u201cThat\u2014fuck, Bryce. That didn\u2019t come out\nright. Look\u2014I had to consider every angle, every possibility, but I know\nnow \u2026 Solas, when I saw your face in that alley, I realized it couldn\u2019t ever\nhave been you, and\u2014\u201d\n\u201cGet the fuck out of my sight.\u201d\nHe watched her, assessing, then spread his wings. She refused to back\nup a step, teeth still bared. The wind off his wings stirred her hair, throwing\nhis cedar-and-rain scent into her face as he leapt into the skies.\nLook toward where it hurts the most.\nFuck the Viper Queen. Fuck everything.\nBryce launched into a run\u2014a steady, swift run, despite the flimsy flats\nshe\u2019d switched into at the gallery. A run not toward anything or from\nanything, but just \u2026 movement. The pounding of her feet on pavement, the\nheaving of her breath.\nBryce ran and ran, until sounds returned and the haze receded and she\ncould escape the screaming labyrinth of her mind. It wasn\u2019t dancing, but it\nwould do.\nBryce ran until her body screamed to stop. Ran until her phone buzzed and\nshe wondered if Urd herself had extended a golden hand. The phone call\nwas swift, breathless.\nMinutes later, Bryce slowed to a walk as she approached the White\nRaven. And then stopped entirely before the alcove tucked into the wall just\nbeside its service doors. Sweat ran down her neck, into her dress, soaking\nthe green fabric as she again pulled out her phone.\nBut she didn\u2019t call Hunt. He hadn\u2019t interrupted her, but she knew he\nwas overhead.\nA few drops of rain splattered the pavement. She hoped it poured on\nAthalar all night.\nHer fingers hesitated on the screen, and she sighed, knowing she\nshouldn\u2019t.\nBut she did. Standing there in that same alcove where she\u2019d exchanged\nsome of her final messages with Danika, she pulled up the thread. It burned\nher eyes.\nShe scrolled upward, past all those final, happy words and teasing. To\nthe photo Danika had sent that afternoon of herself and the pack at the\nsunball game, decked out in CCU gear. In the background, Bryce could\nmake out the players on the field\u2014Ithan\u2019s powerful form among them.\nBut her gaze drifted to Danika\u2019s face. That broad smile she\u2019d known as\nwell as her own.\nI love you, Bryce. The worn memory of that mid-May day during their\nsenior year tugged at her, sucked her in.\nThe hot road bit into Bryce\u2019s knees through her torn jeans, her scraped\nhands trembling as she kept them interlocked behind her head, where she\u2019d\nbeen ordered to hold them. The pain in her arm sliced like a knife. Broken.\nThe males had made her put her hands up anyway.\nThe stolen motorcycle was no more than scrap metal on the dusty\nhighway, the unmarked semitruck pulled over twenty feet away left idle. The\nrifle had been thrown into the olive grove beyond the mountain road,\nwrenched from Bryce\u2019s hands in the accident that had led them here. The\naccident Danika had shielded her from, wrapping her body around Bryce\u2019s.\nDanika had taken the shredding of the asphalt for them both.\nTen feet away, hands also behind her head, Danika bled from so many\nplaces her clothes were soaked with it. How had it come to this? How had\nthings gone so terribly wrong?\n\u201cWhere are those fucking bullets?\u201d the male from the truck shrieked to\nhis cronies, his empty gun\u2014that blessedly, unexpectedly empty gun\u2014\nclenched in his hand.\nDanika\u2019s caramel eyes were wide, searching, as they remained on\nBryce\u2019s face. Sorrow and pain and fear and regret\u2014all of it was written\nthere.\n\u201cI love you, Bryce.\u201d Tears rolled down Danika\u2019s face. \u201cAnd I\u2019m\nsorry.\u201d\nShe had never said those words before. Ever. Bryce had teased her for\nthe past three years about it, but Danika had refused to say them.\nMotion caught Bryce\u2019s attention to their left. Bullets had been found in\nthe truck\u2019s cab. But her gaze remained on Danika. On that beautiful, fierce\nface.\nShe let go, like a key turning in a lock. The first rays of the sun over\nthe horizon.\nAnd Bryce whispered, as those bullets came closer to that awaiting\ngun and the monstrous male who wielded it, \u201cClose your eyes, Danika.\u201d\nBryce blinked, the shimmering memory replaced by the photo still\nglaring from her screen. Of Danika and the Pack of Devils years later\u2014so\nhappy and young and alive.\nMere hours from their true end.\nThe skies opened, and wings rustled above, reminding her of Athalar\u2019s\nhovering presence. But she didn\u2019t bother to look as she strode into the club."}, "25": {"Name": "PART II THE TRENCH-Chapter 25", "Page Content": " 5 \nHunt knew he\u2019d fucked up. And he was in deep shit with Micah\u2014if  Micah\nfound out that he\u2019d revealed the truth about that night.\nHe doubted Quinlan had made that call\u2014either to the sorceress or to\nMicah\u2019s office\u2014and he\u2019d make sure she didn\u2019t. Maybe he\u2019d bribe her with\na new pair of shoes or some purse or whatever the fuck might be enticing\nenough to keep her mouth shut. One fuckup, one misstep, and he had few\nillusions about how Micah would react.\nHe let Quinlan run through the city, trailing her from the Old Square\ninto the dark wasteland of Asphodel Meadows, then into the CBD, and back\nto the Old Square again.\nHunt flew above her, listening to the symphony of honking cars,\nthumping bass, and the brisk April wind whispering through the palms and\ncypresses. Witches on brooms soared down the streets, some close enough\nto touch the roofs of the cars they passed. So different from the angels, Hunt\nincluded, who always kept above the buildings when flying. As if the\nwitches wanted to be a part of the bustle the angels defined themselves by\navoiding.\nWhile he\u2019d trailed Quinlan, Justinian had called with the information\non the kristallos, which amounted to a whole lot of nothing. A few myths\nthat matched with what they already knew. Vik had called five minutes after\nthat: the Viper Queen\u2019s alibis checked out.\nThen Isaiah had called, confirming that the victim in the alley was\nindeed a missing acolyte. He knew Danaan\u2019s suspicions were right: it\ncouldn\u2019t be coincidence that they\u2019d been at the temple yesterday, talking\nabout the Horn and the demon that had slaughtered Danika and the Pack of\nDevils, and now one of its acolytes had died at the kristallos\u2019s claws.\nA Fae girl. Barely more than a child. Acid burned through his stomach\nat the thought.\nHe shouldn\u2019t have brought Quinlan to the murder scene. Shouldn\u2019t\nhave pushed her into going, so blinded by his damn need to get this\ninvestigation solved quickly that he hadn\u2019t thought twice about her\nhesitation.\nHe hadn\u2019t realized until he\u2019d seen her look at the pulped body, until her\nface had gone white as death, that her quiet wasn\u2019t calm at all. It was shock.\nTrauma. Horror. And he\u2019d shoved her into it.\nHe\u2019d fucked up, and Ruhn had been right to call him on that, but\u2014\nshit.\nHe\u2019d taken one look at Quinlan\u2019s ashen face and known she hadn\u2019t\nbeen behind these murders, or even remotely involved. And he was a giant\nfucking asshole for even entertaining the idea. For even telling  her she\u2019d\nbeen on his list.\nHe rubbed his face. He wished Shahar were here, soaring beside him.\nShe\u2019d always let him talk out various strategies or issues during the five\nyears he\u2019d been with her 18th, always listened, and asked questions.\nChallenged him in a way no one else had.\nBy the time an hour had passed and the rain had begun, Hunt had\nplanned a whole speech. He doubted Quinlan wanted to hear it, or would\nadmit what she\u2019d felt today, but he owed her an apology. He\u2019d lost so many\nessential parts of himself over these centuries of enslavement and war, but\nhe liked to think he hadn\u2019t lost his basic decency. At least not yet.\nAfter completing those two thousand\u2013plus kills he still had to make if\nhe failed to solve this case, however, he couldn\u2019t imagine he\u2019d have even\nthat left. Whether the person he\u2019d be at that point would deserve freedom,\nhe didn\u2019t know. Didn\u2019t want to think about it.\nBut then Bryce got a phone call\u2014got one, didn\u2019t make one, thank fuck\n\u2014and didn\u2019t break her stride to answer it. Too high up to hear, he could\nonly watch as she\u2019d shifted directions again and aimed\u2014he realized ten\nminutes later\u2014for Archer Street.\nJust as the rain increased, she\u2019d paused outside the White Raven and\nspent a few minutes on her phone. But despite his eagle-sharp eyesight, he\ncouldn\u2019t make out what she was doing on it. So he\u2019d watched from the\nadjacent roof, and must have checked his own phone a dozen times in those\nfive minutes like a pathetic fucking loser, hoping she\u2019d message him.\nAnd right when the rain turned to a downpour, she put her phone away,\nwalked past the bouncers with a little wave, and vanished into the White\nRaven without so much as a look upward.\nHunt landed, sending Vanir and humans skittering down the sidewalk.\nAnd the half-wolf, half-daemonaki bouncer had the nerve to actually hold\nout a hand. \u201cLine\u2019s to the right,\u201d the male to his left rumbled.\n\u201cI\u2019m with Bryce,\u201d he said.\nThe other bouncer said, \u201cTough shit. Line\u2019s on the right.\u201d\nThe line, despite the early hour, was already down the block. \u201cI\u2019m here\non legion business,\u201d Hunt said, fishing for his badge, wherever the fuck\nhe\u2019d put it\u2014\nThe door cracked open, and a stunning Fae waitress peeked out. \u201cRiso\nsays he\u2019s in, Crucius.\u201d\nThe bouncer who\u2019d first spoken just held Hunt\u2019s stare.\nHunt smirked. \u201cSome other time.\u201d Then he followed the female inside.\nThe scent of sex and booze and sweat that hit him had every instinct\nrising with dizzying speed as they crossed the glass-framed courtyard and\nascended the steps. The half-crumbled pillars were uplit by purple lights.\nHe\u2019d never set foot in the club\u2014always made Isaiah or one of the\nothers do it. Mostly because he knew it was no better than the palaces and\ncountry villas of the Pangeran Archangels, where feasts turned to orgies that\nlasted for days. All while people starved mere steps from those villas\u2014\nhumans and Vanir alike rooting through garbage piles for anything to fill\ntheir children\u2019s bellies. He knew his temper and triggers well enough to stay\nthe fuck away.\nSome people whispered as he walked by. He just kept his eyes on\nBryce, who was already in a booth between two carved pillars, sipping at a\nglass of something clear\u2014either vodka or gin. With all the scents in here,\nhe couldn\u2019t make it out.\nHer eyes lifted to him from the rim of her glass as she sipped. \u201cHow\u2019d\nyou  get in?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a public place, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nShe said nothing. Hunt sighed, and was about to sit down to make that\napology when he scented jasmine and vanilla, and\u2014\n\u201cExcuse me, sir\u2014oh. Um. Erm.\u201d He found himself looking at a lovely\nfaun, dressed in a white tank top and skirt short enough to show off her\nlong, striped legs and delicate hooves. Her gently arcing horns were nearly\nhidden in curly hair that was pulled back into a coiled bun, her brown skin\ndusted with gold that flickered in the club lights. Gods, she was beautiful.\nJuniper Andromeda: Bryce\u2019s friend in the ballet. He\u2019d read her file,\ntoo. The dancer glanced between Hunt and Quinlan. \u201cI\u2014I hope I\u2019m not\ninterrupting anything\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHe was just leaving,\u201d Bryce said, draining her glass.\nHe finally slid into the booth. \u201cI was just arriving.\u201d He extended a\nhand to the faun. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you. I\u2019m Hunt.\u201d\n\u201cI know who you are,\u201d the faun said, her voice husky.\nJuniper\u2019s grip was light but solid. Bryce refilled her glass from a\ndecanter of clear liquid and drank deep. Juniper asked her, \u201cDid you order\nfood? Rehearsal just let out and I\u2019m starving .\u201d Though the faun was thin,\nshe was leanly muscled, strong as Hel beneath that graceful exterior.\nBryce held up her drink. \u201cI\u2019m having a liquid dinner.\u201d\nJuniper frowned. But she asked Hunt, \u201cYou want food?\u201d\n\u201cHel yes.\u201d\n\u201cYou can order whatever you want\u2014they\u2019ll get it for you.\u201d She raised\na hand, signaling a waitress. \u201cI\u2019ll have a veggie burger, no cheese, with a\nside of fries, vegetable oil only to cook them, and two pieces of pizza\u2014\nplant-based cheese on it, please.\u201d She bit her lip, then explained to Hunt, \u201cI\ndon\u2019t eat animal products.\u201d\nAs a faun, meat and dairy were abhorrent. Milk was only for nursing\nbabies.\n\u201cGot it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou mind if I do?\u201d He\u2019d fought alongside fauns\nover the centuries. Some hadn\u2019t been able to stand the sight of meat. Some\nhadn\u2019t cared. It was always worth asking.\nJuniper blinked, but shook her head.\nHe offered the waitress a smile as he said, \u201cI\u2019ll have \u2026 a bone-in rib\neye and roasted green beans.\u201d What the Hel. He glanced at Bryce, who was\nguzzling her booze like it was a protein shake.\nShe hadn\u2019t eaten dinner yet, and even though he\u2019d been distracted this\nmorning when she\u2019d emerged from her bedroom in nothing but a lacy hot-\npink bra and matching underwear, he\u2019d noted through the living room\nwindow that she\u2019d also forgone breakfast, and since she hadn\u2019t brought\nlunch with her or ordered in, he was willing to bet she hadn\u2019t eaten that,\neither.\nSo Hunt said, \u201cShe\u2019ll have lamb kofta with rice, roasted chickpeas, and\npickles on the side. Thanks.\u201d He\u2019d watched her go for lunch a few times\nnow, and had scented precisely what was inside her takeaway bags. Bryce\nopened her mouth, but the waitress was already gone. Juniper surveyed\nthem nervously. Like she knew precisely what Bryce was about to\u2014\n\u201cAre you going to cut my food, too?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cJust because you\u2019re some big, tough asshole doesn\u2019t mean you get the\nright to decide when I should eat\u2014or when I\u2019m  not taking care of my body.\nI\u2019m the one who lives in it, I  know when I fucking want to eat. So keep\nyour possessive and aggressive bullshit to yourself.\u201d\nJuniper\u2019s swallow was audible over the music. \u201cLong day at work,\nBryce?\u201d\nBryce reached for her drink again. But Hunt moved faster, his hand\nwrapping around her wrist and pinning it to the table before she could\nguzzle down more booze.\n\u201cGet your fucking hand off me,\u201d she snarled.\nHunt threw her a half smile. \u201cDon\u2019t be such a clich\u00e9.\u201d Her eyes\nsimmered. \u201cYou have a rough day and you come to drown yourself in\nvodka?\u201d He snorted, letting go of her wrist and grabbing her glass. He lifted\nit to his lips, holding her stare over the rim as he said, \u201cAt least tell me you\nhave good taste in\u2014\u201d He sniffed the liquor. Tasted it. \u201cThis is water.\u201d\nHer fingers curled into fists on the table. \u201cI don\u2019t drink.\u201d\nJuniper said, \u201cI invited Bryce tonight. It\u2019s been a while since we\u2019ve\nseen each other, and I have to meet some of the company members here\nlater, so\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you drink?\u201d Hunt asked Bryce.\n\u201cYou\u2019re the Umbra Mortis. I\u2019m sure you can figure it out.\u201d Bryce\nscooted out of the booth, forcing Juniper to get up. \u201cThough considering\nyou thought I killed my best friend, maybe you can\u2019t.\u201d Hunt bristled, but\nBryce just declared, \u201cI\u2019m going to the bathroom.\u201d Then she walked right\ninto the throng on the ancient dance floor, the crowd swallowing her as she\nwove her way toward a distant door between two pillars at the back of the\nspace.\nJuniper\u2019s face was tight. \u201cI\u2019ll go with her.\u201d\nThen she was gone, moving swift and light, two males gaping as she\npassed. Juniper ignored them. She caught up to Bryce midway across the\ndance floor, halting her with a hand on her arm. Juniper smiled\u2014bright as\nthe lights around them\u2014and began speaking, gesturing to the booth, the\nclub. Bryce\u2019s face remained cold as stone. Colder.\nMales approached, saw that expression, and didn\u2019t venture closer.\n\u201cWell, if she\u2019s pissed at you, it\u2019ll make me look better,\u201d drawled a\nmale voice beside him.\nHunt didn\u2019t bother to look pleasant. \u201cTell me you\u2019ve found\nsomething.\u201d\nThe Crown Prince of the Valbaran Fae leaned against the edge of the\nbooth, his strikingly blue eyes lingering on his cousin. He\u2019d no doubt used\nthose shadows of his to creep up without Hunt\u2019s notice. \u201cNegative. I got a\ncall from the Raven\u2019s owner that she was here. She was in bad enough\nshape when she left the crime scene that I wanted to make sure she was all\nright.\u201d\nHunt couldn\u2019t argue with that. So he said nothing.\nRuhn nodded toward where the females stood motionless in the middle\nof a sea of dancers. \u201cShe used to dance, you know. If she\u2019d been able, she\nwould have gone into the ballet like Juniper.\u201d\nHe hadn\u2019t known\u2014not really. Those facts had been blips on her file.\n\u201cWhy\u2019d she drop it?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask her. But she stopped dancing completely after\nDanika died.\u201d\n\u201cAnd drinking, it seems.\u201d Hunt glanced toward her discarded glass of\nwater.\nRuhn followed his line of sight. If he was surprised, the prince didn\u2019t\nlet on.\nHunt took a sip of Bryce\u2019s water and shook his head. Not a party girl at\nall\u2014just content to let the world believe the worst of her.\nIncluding him. Hunt rolled his shoulders, wings moving with him, as\nhe watched her on the dance floor. Yeah, he\u2019d fucked up. Royally.\nBryce looked toward the booth and when she saw her cousin there \u2026\nThere were trenches of Hel warmer than the look she gave Ruhn.\nJuniper tracked her gaze.\nBryce took all of one step toward the booth before the club exploded."}, "26": {"Name": "PART II THE TRENCH-Chapter 26", "Page Content": " 6 \nOne minute, Athalar and Ruhn were talking. One minute, Bryce was about\nto go rip into both of them for their alphahole protectiveness, smothering\nher even from afar. One minute, she was just trying not to drown in the\nweight that had yanked her under that too-familiar black surface. No\namount of running could free her from it, buy her a sip of air.\nThe next, her ears hollowed out, the ground ripped from beneath her,\nthe ceiling rained down, people screamed, blood sprayed, fear scented the\nair, and she was twisting, lunging for Juniper\u2014\nShrill, incessant ringing filled her head.\nThe world had been tipped on its side.\nOr maybe that was because she lay sprawled on the wrecked floor,\ndebris and shrapnel and body parts around her.\nBut Bryce kept down, stayed arched over Juniper, who might have\nbeen screaming\u2014\nThat shrill ringing wouldn\u2019t stop. It drowned out every other sound.\nCoppery slickness in her mouth\u2014blood. Plaster coated her skin.\n\u201cGet up.\u201d Hunt\u2019s voice cut through the ringing, the screaming, the\nshrieking, and his strong hands wrapped around her shoulders. She thrashed\nagainst him, reaching for Juniper\u2014\nBut Ruhn was already there, blood running from his temple as he\nhelped her friend stand\u2014\nBryce looked over every inch of Juniper: plaster and dust and someone\nelse\u2019s green blood, but not a scratch, not a scratch, not a scratch\u2014\nBryce swayed back into Hunt, who gripped her shoulders. \u201cWe need to\nget out\u2014now,\u201d the angel was saying to Ruhn, ordering her brother like a\nfoot soldier. \u201cThere could be more.\u201d\nJuniper pushed out of Ruhn\u2019s grip and screamed at Bryce, \u201cAre you out\nof your mind?\u201d\nHer ears\u2014her ears wouldn\u2019t stop ringing, and maybe her brain was\nleaking because she couldn\u2019t talk, couldn\u2019t seem to remember how to use\nher limbs\u2014\nJuniper swung. Bryce didn\u2019t feel the impact on her cheek. Juniper\nsobbed as if her body would break apart. \u201cI made the Drop, Bryce! Two\nyears ago! You haven\u2019t! Have you completely lost it?\u201d\nA warm, strong arm slid across her abdomen, holding her upright.\nHunt said, his mouth near her ear, \u201cJuniper, she\u2019s shell-shocked. Give it a\nrest.\u201d\nJuniper snapped at him, \u201cStay out of this!\u201d But people were wailing,\nscreaming, and debris was still raining down. Pillars lay like fallen trees\naround them. June seemed to notice, to realize\u2014\nHer body, gods, her body wouldn\u2019t work\u2014\nHunt didn\u2019t object when Ruhn gave them an address nearby and told them\nto go wait for him there. It was closer than her apartment, but frankly, Hunt\nwasn\u2019t entirely sure Bryce would let him in\u2014and if she went into shock and\nhe couldn\u2019t get past those enchantments \u2026 Well, Micah would spike his\nhead to the front gates of the Comitium if she died on his watch.\nHe might very well do that just for not sensing that the attack was\nabout to happen.\nQuinlan didn\u2019t seem to notice he was carrying her. She was heavier\nthan she looked\u2014her tan skin covered more muscle than he\u2019d thought.\nHunt found the familiar white-columned house a few blocks away; the\nkey Ruhn had given him opened a green-painted door. The cavernous foyer\nwas laced with two male scents other than the prince\u2019s. A flick of the light\nswitch revealed a grand staircase that looked like it\u2019d been through a war\nzone, scuffed oak floors, and a crystal chandelier hanging precariously.\nBeneath it: a beer pong table painted with remarkable skill\u2014\nportraying a gigantic Fae male swallowing an angel whole.\nIgnoring that particular fuck you to his kind, Hunt aimed for the living\nroom to the left of the entry. A stained sectional lay against the far wall of\nthe long room, and Hunt set Bryce down there as he hurried for the equally\nworn wet bar midway down the far wall. Water\u2014she needed some water.\nThere hadn\u2019t been an attack in the city for years now\u2014since Briggs.\nHe\u2019d felt the bomb\u2019s power as it rippled through the club, shredding the\nformer temple and its inhabitants apart. He\u2019d leave it to the investigators to\nsee what exactly it was, but\u2014\nEven his lightning hadn\u2019t been fast enough to stop it, not that it would\nhave been any protection against a bomb, not in an ambush like that. He\u2019d\ndestroyed enough on battlefields to know how to intercept them with his\npower, how to match death with death, but this hadn\u2019t been some long-\nrange missile fired from a tank.\nIt had been planted somewhere in the club, and detonated at a\npredetermined moment. There were a handful of people who might be\ncapable of such a thing, and at the top of Hunt\u2019s list \u2026 there was Philip\nBriggs again. Or his followers, at least\u2014Briggs himself was still\nimprisoned at the Adrestia Prison. He\u2019d think on it later, when his head\nwasn\u2019t still spinning, and his lightning wasn\u2019t still a crackle in his blood,\nhungry for an enemy to obliterate.\nHunt turned his attention to the woman who sat on the couch, staring\nat nothing.\nBryce\u2019s green dress was wrecked, her skin was covered in plaster and\nsomeone else\u2019s blood, her face pale\u2014save for the red mark on her cheek.\nHunt grabbed an ice pack from the freezer under the bar counter and a\ndish towel to wrap it in. He set the glass of water on the stained wood\ncoffee table, then handed her the ice. \u201cShe slugged you pretty damn good.\u201d\nThose amber eyes lifted slowly to him. Dried blood crusted inside her\nears.\nA moment\u2019s searching in the sorry-looking kitchen and bathroom\ncabinet revealed more towels and a first aid kit.\nHe knelt on the worn gray carpet before her, tucking his wings in tight\nto keep them from tangling with the beer cans that littered the coffee table.\nShe kept staring at nothing as he cleaned out her bloody ears.\nHe didn\u2019t have med-magic like a witch, but he knew enough battlefield\nhealing to assess her arched ears. The Fae hearing would have made that\nexplosion horrific\u2014the human bloodline then slowing down the healing\nprocess. Mercifully, he found no signs of continued bleeding or damage.\nHe started on the left ear. And when he\u2019d finished, he noticed her\nknees were scraped raw, with shards of stone embedded in them.\n\u201cJuniper stands a shot of being promoted to principal,\u201d Bryce rasped at\nlast. \u201cThe first faun ever. The summer season starts soon\u2014she\u2019s an\nunderstudy for the main roles in two of the ballets. A soloist in all five of\nthem. This season is crucial. If she got injured, it could interfere.\u201d\n\u201cShe made the Drop. She would have bounced back quickly.\u201d He\npulled a pair of tweezers from the kit.\n\u201cStill.\u201d\nShe hissed as he carefully pried out some shards of metal and stone\nfrom her knee. She\u2019d hit the ground hard. Even with the club exploding,\nhe\u2019d seen her move.\nShe\u2019d thrown herself right over Juniper, shielding her from the blast.\n\u201cThis will sting,\u201d he told her, frowning at the bottle of healing\nsolution. Fancy, high-priced stuff. Surprising that it was even here, given\nthat the prince and his roommates had all made the Drop. \u201cBut it\u2019ll keep it\nfrom scarring.\u201d\nShe shrugged, studying the massive, dark television screen over his\nshoulder.\nHunt doused her leg with the solution, and she jerked. He gripped her\ncalf hard enough to keep her down, even as she cursed. \u201cI warned you.\u201d\nShe pushed a breath out between clenched teeth. The hem of her\nalready short dress had ridden up with her movements, and Hunt told\nhimself he looked only to assess if there were other injuries, but\u2014\nThe thick, angry scar cut across an otherwise sleek, unnervingly\nperfect thigh.\nHunt stilled. She\u2019d never gotten it healed.\nAnd every limp he\u2019d sometimes caught her making from the corner of\nhis eye \u2026 Not from her dumb fucking shoes. But from this. From him.\nFrom his clumsy battlefield instincts to staple her up like a soldier.\n\u201cWhen males are kneeling between my legs, Athalar,\u201d she said,\n\u201cthey\u2019re not usually grimacing.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d But her words registered, just at the moment he realized his\nhand still gripped her calf, the silky skin beneath brushing against the\ncalluses on his palms. Just as he realized that he was indeed kneeling\nbetween her thighs, and had leaned closer to her lap to see that scar.\nHunt reeled back, unable to help the heat rising to his face. He\nremoved his hand from her leg. \u201cSorry,\u201d he ground out.\nAny amusement faded from her eyes as she said, \u201cWho do you think\ndid it\u2014the club?\u201d\nThe heat of her soft skin still stained his palm. \u201cNo idea.\u201d\n\u201cCould it have anything to do with us looking into this case?\u201d Guilt\nalready dampened her eyes, and he knew the body of the acolyte flashed\nthrough her mind.\nHe shook his head. \u201cProbably not. If someone wanted to stop us, a\nbullet in the head\u2019s a lot more precise than blowing up a club. It could\neasily have been some rival of the club\u2019s owner. Or the remaining Keres\nmembers looking to start more shit in this city.\u201d\nBryce asked, \u201cYou think we\u2019ll have war here?\u201d\n\u201cSome humans want us to. Some Vanir want us to. To get rid of the\nhumans, they say.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019ve destroyed parts of Pangera with the war there,\u201d she\nmumbled. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the footage.\u201d She looked at him, letting her unspoken\nquestion hang. How bad was it?\nHunt just said, \u201cMagic and machines. Never a good mix.\u201d\nThe words rippled between them. \u201cI want to go home,\u201d she breathed.\nHe peeled off his jacket and settled it around her shoulders. It nearly\ndevoured her. \u201cI want to shower all this off.\u201d She gestured at the blood on\nher bare skin.\n\u201cOkay.\u201d But the front door in the foyer opened. One set of booted feet.\nHunt had his gun out, hidden against his thigh as he turned, when\nRuhn walked in, shadows in his wake. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to like this,\u201d the\nprince said.\nShe wanted to go home. Wanted to call Juniper. Wanted to call her mom and\nRandall just to hear their voices. Wanted to call Fury and learn what she\nknew, even if Fury wouldn\u2019t pick up or answer her messages. Wanted to call\nJesiba and make her find out what had happened. But she mostly just\nwanted to go home and shower.\nRuhn, stone-faced and blood-splattered, halted in the archway.\nHunt slid the handgun back into its holster at his thigh before sitting on\nthe couch beside her.\nRuhn went to the wet bar and filled a glass of water from the sink.\nEvery movement was stiff, shadows whispering around him. But the prince\nexhaled and the shadows, the tension, vanished.\nHunt spared her from demanding that Ruhn elaborate. \u201cI\u2019m assuming\nthis has to do with whoever bombed the club?\u201d\nRuhn nodded and tossed back a gulp of water. \u201cAll signs point to the\nhuman rebels.\u201d Bryce\u2019s blood chilled. She and Hunt swapped glances. Their\ndiscussion moments ago hadn\u2019t been far from the mark. \u201cThe bomb was\nsmuggled into the club through some new exploding liquid hidden in a\ndelivery of wine. They left the calling card on the crate\u2014their own logo.\u201d\nHunt cut in. \u201cAny potential connection to Philip Briggs?\u201d\nRuhn said, \u201cBriggs is still behind bars.\u201d A polite way of describing the\npunishment the rebel leader now endured at Vanir hands in Adrestia Prison.\n\u201cThe rest of his Keres group isn\u2019t,\u201d Bryce croaked. \u201cDanika was the\none who made the raid on Briggs in the first place. Even if he didn\u2019t kill\nher, he\u2019s still doing time for his rebel crimes. He could have instructed his\nfollowers to carry out this bombing.\u201d\nRuhn frowned. \u201cI thought they\u2019d disbanded\u2014joined other factions or\nreturned to Pangera. But here\u2019s the part you\u2019re not going to like. Next to the\nlogo on the crate was a branded image. My team and your team thought it\nwas a warped C for Crescent City, but I looked at the footage of the storage\narea before the bomb went off. It\u2019s hard to make out, but it could also be\ndepicting a curved horn.\u201d\n\u201cWhat does the Horn have to do with the human rebellion?\u201d Bryce\nasked. Then her mouth dried out. \u201cWait. Do you think that Horn image was\na message to us? To warn us away from looking for the Horn? As if that\nacolyte wasn\u2019t enough?\u201d\nHunt mused, \u201cIt can\u2019t just be coincidence that the club was bombed\nwhen we were there. Or that one of the images on the crate seems like it\ncould be the Horn, when we\u2019re knee-deep in a search for it. Before Danika\nbusted him, Briggs planned to blow up the Raven. The Keres sect has been\ninactive since he went to prison, but \u2026\u201d\n\u201cThey could be coming back,\u201d Bryce insisted. \u201cLooking to pick up\nwhere Briggs left off, or somehow getting directions from him even now.\u201d\nHunt looked somber. \u201cOr it was one of Briggs\u2019s followers all along\u2014\nthe planned bombing, Danika\u2019s murder, this bombing \u2026 Briggs might not\nbe guilty, but maybe he knows who is. He could be protecting someone.\u201d\nHe pulled out his phone. \u201cWe need to talk to him.\u201d\nRuhn said, \u201cAre you fucking nuts?\u201d\nHunt ignored him and dialed a number, rising to his feet. \u201cHe\u2019s in\nAdrestia Prison, so the request might take a few days,\u201d he said to Bryce.\n\u201cFine.\u201d She blocked out the thought of what, exactly, this meeting\nwould be like. Danika had been unnerved by Briggs\u2019s fanaticism toward the\nhuman cause, and had rarely wanted to talk about him. Busting him and his\nKeres group\u2014an offshoot of the main Ophion rebellion\u2014had been a\ntriumph, a legitimization of the Pack of Devils. It still hadn\u2019t been enough\nto win Sabine\u2019s approval.\nHunt tucked the phone to his ear. \u201cHey, Isaiah. Yeah, I\u2019m all right.\u201d He\nstepped into the foyer, and Bryce watched him go.\nRuhn said quietly, \u201cThe Autumn King knows I\u2019ve involved you in\nlooking for the Horn.\u201d\nShe lifted heavy eyes to her brother. \u201cHow pissed is he?\u201d\nRuhn\u2019s grim smile wasn\u2019t comforting. \u201cHe warned me of the poison\nyou\u2019d spew in my ear.\u201d\n\u201cI should take that as a compliment, I suppose.\u201d\nRuhn didn\u2019t smile this time. \u201cHe wants to know what you\u2019ll do with\nthe Horn if it\u2019s found.\u201d\n\u201cUse it as my new drinking mug on game day.\u201d\nHunt gave a snort of laughter as he entered the room, call over. Ruhn\njust said, \u201cHe was serious.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll give it back to the temple,\u201d Bryce said. \u201cNot to him.\u201d\nRuhn looked at both of them as Hunt again sat on the couch. \u201cMy\nfather said that since I have now involved you in something so dangerous,\nBryce, you need a guard to \u2026 remain with you at all times. Live with you. I\nvolunteered.\u201d\nEvery part of her battered body ached. \u201cOver my dead fucking\ncorpse.\u201d\nHunt crossed his arms. \u201cWhy does your king care if Quinlan lives or\ndies?\u201d\nRuhn\u2019s eyes grew cold. \u201cI asked him the same. He said that she falls\nunder his jurisdiction, as half-Fae, and he doesn\u2019t want to have to clean up\nany messy situations. The girl is a liability, he said.\u201d Bryce could hear the\ncruel tones in every word Ruhn mimicked. Could see her father\u2019s face as he\nspoke them. She often imagined how it\u2019d feel to beat in that perfect face\nwith her fists. To give him a scar like the one her mother bore along her\ncheekbone\u2014small and slender, no longer than a fingernail, but a reminder\nof the blow he\u2019d given her when his hideous rage drove him too far.\nThe blow that had sent Ember Quinlan running\u2014pregnant with Bryce.\nCreep. Old, hateful creep.\n\u201cSo he\u2019s just concerned about the PR nightmare of Quinlan\u2019s death\nbefore the Summit,\u201d Hunt said roughly, disgust tightening his face.\n\u201cDon\u2019t look so shocked,\u201d Ruhn said, then added to Bryce, \u201cI\u2019m only\nthe messenger. Consider whether it\u2019s wise to pick this as your big battle\nwith him.\u201d\nNo chance in Hel was she letting Ruhn into her apartment to order her\naround. Especially with those friends of his. It was bad enough she had to\nwork with him on this case.\nGods, her head was pounding. \u201cFine,\u201d she said, simmering. \u201cHe said I\nneeded a guard\u2014not you specifically, right?\u201d At Ruhn\u2019s tense silence,\nBryce went on, \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought. Athalar stays with me instead. Order\nfulfilled. Happy?\u201d\n\u201cHe won\u2019t like that.\u201d\nBryce smiled smugly, even as her blood simmered. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say who\nthe guard had to be. The bastard should have been more precise with his\nwording.\u201d\nEven Ruhn couldn\u2019t argue against that.\nIf Athalar was shocked at Bryce\u2019s choice of roommates, he didn\u2019t let on.\nRuhn watched the angel glance between them\u2014carefully.\nFuck. Had Athalar finally started putting it together\u2014that they were\nmore entwined than cousins should be, that Ruhn\u2019s father shouldn\u2019t be\ntaking such an interest in her?\nBryce seethed at Ruhn, \u201cDid you put your father up to this?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Ruhn said. His father had cornered him about the temple visit\nright as he left the ruined club. Honestly, given how pissed the male had\nbeen, it was a miracle Ruhn wasn\u2019t dead in a gutter. \u201cHe\u2019s got a network of\nspies that even I don\u2019t know about.\u201d\nBryce scowled, but it morphed into a wince as she got off the couch,\nAthalar keeping a hand within easy reach of her elbow, should she need it.\nRuhn\u2019s phone buzzed, and he pulled it from his pocket long enough to\nread the message on the screen. And the others that began flying in.\nDeclan had written in the group chain with Flynn, What the fuck\nhappened?\nFlynn replied, I\u2019m at the club. Sabine sent Amelie Ravenscroft to head\nthe Aux packs hauling away debris and helping the wounded. Amelie said\nshe saw you leave, Ruhn. You all right?\nRuhn answered, just so they wouldn\u2019t call. I\u2019m fine. I\u2019ll meet you at the\nclub soon. He squeezed the phone in his fist as Bryce made her way toward\nthe front door and the Helscape beyond. Blue and red sirens blared, casting\ntheir light on the oak floors of the foyer.\nBut his sister paused before reaching for the handle, twisting to ask\nhim, \u201cWhy were you at the Raven earlier?\u201d\nAnd here it was. If he mentioned the call Riso had made to him, that\nRuhn had been keeping tabs on her, he\u2019d get his head bitten off. So Ruhn\nhalf lied, \u201cI want to check out your boss\u2019s library.\u201d\nHunt paused, a step behind Bryce. It was impressive, really, to watch\nboth of them plaster confused expressions on their faces.\n\u201cWhat library?\u201d she asked, the portrait of innocence.\nRuhn could have sworn Athalar was trying not to smile. But he said\ntightly, \u201cThe one everyone says is beneath the gallery.\u201d\n\u201cFirst I\u2019ve heard of it,\u201d Hunt said with a shrug.\n\u201cFuck off, Athalar.\u201d Ruhn\u2019s jaw ached from clenching it so hard.\nBryce said, \u201cLook, I get that you want in on our little cool kids\u2019 club,\nbut there\u2019s a strict membership-vetting process.\u201d\nYeah, Athalar was trying really hard not to smile.\nRuhn growled, \u201cI want to look at the books there. See if anything\nabout the Horn jumps out.\u201d She paused at the tone in his voice, the bit of\ndominance Ruhn threw into it. He wasn\u2019t above pulling rank. Not where\nthis was concerned.\nThough Athalar was glaring daggers at him, Ruhn said to his sister,\n\u201cI\u2019ve been through the Fae Archives twice, and \u2026\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI\njust kept thinking about the gallery. So maybe there\u2019s something there.\u201d\n\u201cI searched it,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing about the Horn beyond\nvague mentions.\u201d\nRuhn gave her a half smile. \u201cSo you admit there\u2019s a library.\u201d\nBryce frowned at him. He knew that contemplative look. \u201cWhat.\u201d\nBryce flipped her hair over a dirty, torn shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll make a bargain\nwith you: you can come hunt for the Horn at the gallery, and I\u2019ll help in\nwhatever way I can. If\u2014\u201d Athalar whipped his head to her, the outrage on\nhis face almost delightful. Bryce went on, nodding to the phone in Ruhn\u2019s\nhand, \u201cIf you put Declan at my disposal.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll have to tell him about this case, then. And what he knows, Flynn\nwill learn two seconds later.\u201d\n\u201cFine. Go ahead and fill them in. But tell Dec I need intel about\nDanika\u2019s last movements.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where he can get that,\u201d Ruhn admitted.\n\u201cThe Den would have it,\u201d Hunt said, eyeing Bryce with something like\nadmiration. \u201cTell Emmet to hack the Den archives.\u201d\nSo Ruhn nodded. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll ask him later.\u201d\nBryce gave him that smile that didn\u2019t meet her eyes. \u201cThen come by\nthe gallery tomorrow.\u201d\nRuhn had to give himself a moment to master his shock at how easy it\nhad been to get access. Then he said, \u201cBe careful out there.\u201d\nIf she and Athalar were right and it was some Keres rebels acting on\nBriggs\u2019s request or in his honor \u2026 the political mess would be a nightmare.\nAnd if he hadn\u2019t been wrong about that C actually being an image of the\nHorn, if this bombing and the acolyte\u2019s murder were targeted warnings to\nthem regarding their search for it \u2026 then the threat to all of them had just\nbecome a Hel of a lot deadlier.\nBryce said sweetly before continuing on, \u201cTell your daddy we say\nhello\u2014and that he can go fuck himself.\u201d\nRuhn gritted his teeth again, earning another grin from Athalar.\nWinged asshole.\nThe two of them strode through the door, and Ruhn\u2019s phone rang a\nheartbeat after that.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he said.\nRuhn could have sworn he could hear his father tense before the male\ndrawled, \u201cIs that how you speak to your king?\u201d\nRuhn didn\u2019t bother replying. His father said, \u201cSince you couldn\u2019t stop\nyourself from revealing my business, I wish to make one thing clear\nregarding the Horn.\u201d Ruhn braced himself. \u201cI don\u2019t want the angels getting\nit.\u201d\n\u201cFine.\u201d If Ruhn had anything to say about it, no one would get the\nHorn. It would go straight back to the temple, with a permanent Fae guard.\n\u201cKeep an eye on that girl.\u201d\n\u201cBoth eyes.\u201d\n\u201cI mean it, boy.\u201d\n\u201cSo do I.\u201d He let his father hear the growl of sincerity in his voice.\nHis father went on, \u201cYou, as Crown Prince, revealed the secrets of\nyour king to the girl and Athalar. I have every right to punish you for this,\nyou know.\u201d\nGo ahead, he wanted to say. Go ahead and do it. Do me a favor and\ntake my title while you\u2019re at it. The royal bloodline ends with me anyway.\nRuhn had puked after hearing it the first time when he was thirteen,\nsent to the Oracle for a glimpse of his future, like all Fae. The ritual had\nonce been to foretell marriages and alliances. Today, it was more to get a\nfeel for a child\u2019s career and whether they\u2019d amount to anything. For Ruhn\u2014\nand for Bryce, years later\u2014it had been a disaster.\nRuhn had begged the Oracle to tell him whether she meant he\u2019d die\nbefore he could sire a child, or if she meant he was infertile. She only\nrepeated her words. The royal bloodline shall end with you, Prince.\nHe\u2019d been too much of a coward to tell his king what he\u2019d learned. So\nhe\u2019d fed his father a lie, unable to bear the male\u2019s disappointment and rage.\nThe Oracle said I would be a fair and just king.\nHis father had been disappointed, but only that the fake prophecy\nhadn\u2019t been mightier.\nSo, yeah. If his father wanted to strip him of his title, he\u2019d be doing\nhim a favor. Or even unwittingly fulfilling that prophecy at last.\nRuhn had truly worried about its meaning once\u2014the day he\u2019d learned\nhe had a little sister. He\u2019d thought it might foretell an untimely death for\nher. But his fears had been assuaged by the fact that she was not and would\nnever be formally recognized as part of the royal bloodline. To his relief,\nshe\u2019d never questioned why, in those early years when they were still close,\nRuhn hadn\u2019t lobbied their father to publicly accept her.\nThe Autumn King continued, \u201cUnfortunately, the punishment you\ndeserve would render you unable to look for the Horn.\u201d\nRuhn\u2019s shadows drifted around him. \u201cI\u2019ll take a rain check, then.\u201d\nHis father snarled, but Ruhn hung up."}, "27": {"Name": "PART II THE TRENCH-Chapter 27", "Page Content": " 7 \nThe streets were packed with Vanir streaming from the still-chaotic White\nRaven, all looking for answers about what the Hel had happened. Various\nlegionaries, Fae, and Aux pack members had erected a barricade around the\nsite, a thrumming, opaque magic wall, but the crowds still converged.\nHunt glanced to where Bryce walked beside him, silent, glassy-eyed.\nBarefoot, he realized.\nHow long had she been barefoot? She must have lost her shoes in the\nexplosion.\nHe debated offering to carry her again, or suggesting that he fly them\nto her apartment, but she held her arms so tightly around herself that he had\na feeling one word would send her into a rage-spiral with no bottom.\nThe look she gave Ruhn before walking out \u2026 It made Hunt glad she\nwasn\u2019t an acid-spitting viper. The male\u2019s face would have melted.\nGods help them when the prince arrived at the gallery tomorrow.\nBryce\u2019s doorman leapt out of his seat as they walked into the pristine\nlobby, asking if she was all right, if she\u2019d been in the club. She mumbled\nthat she was fine, and the ursine shifter surveyed Hunt with a predator\u2019s\nfocus. Noticing that look, she waved a hand at him, punching the elevator\nbutton, and introduced them. Hunt, this is Marrin; Marrin, this is Hunt; he\u2019s\nstaying with me for the foreseeable future, unfortunately. Then she was\npadding into the elevator, where she had to lean against the chrome rail\nalong the back, as if she were about to collapse\u2014\nHunt squeezed in as the doors were closing. The box was too small,\ntoo tight with his wings, and he kept them close as they shot up to the\npenthouse\u2014\nBryce\u2019s head sagged, her shoulders curving inward\u2014\nHunt blurted, \u201cWhy won\u2019t you make the Drop?\u201d\nThe elevator doors opened and she slumped against them before she\nentered the elegant cream-and-cobalt hallway. But she halted at her\napartment door. Then turned to him.\n\u201cMy keys were in my purse.\u201d\nHer purse was now in the ruin of the club.\n\u201cDoes the doorman have a spare?\u201d\nShe grunted her confirmation, eyeing the elevator as if it were a\nmountain to climb.\nMarrin busted Hunt\u2019s balls for a good minute, checking that Bryce was\nalive in the hallway, asking into the hall vidcom if she approved\u2014to which\nhe got a thumbs-up.\nWhen Hunt returned, he found her sitting against her door, legs up and\nspread enough to show a pair of hot-pink underwear. Thankfully, the hall\ncameras couldn\u2019t see at that angle, but he had no doubt the shifter\nmonitored them as Hunt helped her to her feet and handed her the spare\nkeys.\nShe slowly slid in the key, then put her palm to the bespelled finger\npad beside the door.\n\u201cI was waiting,\u201d she murmured as the locks clicked open and the dim\napartment lights flickered on. \u201cWe were supposed to make the Drop\ntogether. We picked two years from now.\u201d\nHe knew who she meant. The reason why she no longer drank, or\ndanced, or really seemed to live her life. The reason why she must keep that\nscar on her pretty, sleek thigh. Ogenas and all her sacred Mysteries knew\nthat Hunt had punished himself for a damn long while after the colossal\nfailure that had been the Battle of Mount Hermon. Even while he\u2019d been\ntortured in the Asteri\u2019s dungeons, he\u2019d punished himself, flaying his own\nsoul in a way no imperial interrogator ever could.\nSo maybe it was a stupid question, but he asked as they entered the\napartment, \u201cWhy bother waiting now?\u201d\nHunt stepped inside and got a good look at the place Quinlan called\nhome. The open-concept apartment had looked nice from outside the\nwindows, but inside \u2026\nEither she or Danika had decorated it without sparing any expense: a\nwhite deep-cushioned couch lay in the right third of the great room, set\nbefore a reclaimed wood coffee table and the massive television atop a\ncarved oak console. A fogged-glass dining table with white leather chairs\ntook up the left third of the space, and the center third of it went to the\nkitchen\u2014white cabinets, chrome appliances, and white marble counters. All\nof it impeccably clean, soft, and welcoming.\nHunt took it in, standing like a piece of baggage by the kitchen island\nwhile Bryce padded down a pale oak hallway to release Syrinx from where\nhe yowled from his crate.\nShe was halfway down the hallway when she said without looking\nback, \u201cWithout Danika \u2026 We were supposed to make the Drop together,\u201d\nshe said again. \u201cConnor and Thorne were going to Anchor us.\u201d\nThe choice of Anchor during the Drop was pivotal\u2014and a deeply\npersonal choice. But Hunt shoved aside the thoughts of the sour-faced\ngovernment employee he\u2019d been appointed, since he sure as fuck hadn\u2019t had\nany family or friends left to Anchor him. Not when his mother had died\nonly days before.\nSyrinx flung himself through the apartment, claws clicking on the light\nwood floors, yipping as he leapt upon Hunt, licking his hands. Each one of\nBryce\u2019s returning steps dragged on her way to the kitchen counter.\nThe silence pressed on him enough that he asked, \u201cWere you and\nDanika lovers?\u201d\nHe\u2019d been told two years ago that they weren\u2019t, but friends didn\u2019t\nmourn each other the way Bryce seemed to have so thoroughly shut down\nevery part of herself. The way he had for Shahar.\nThe patter of kibble hitting tin filled the apartment before Bryce\nplunked down the bowl, and Syrinx, abandoning Hunt, half threw himself\ninside it as he gobbled it down.\nHunt turned in place as Bryce padded around the other end of the\nkitchen island, flinging open the enormous metal fridge to examine its\nmeager contents. \u201cNo,\u201d she said, her voice flat and cold. \u201cDanika and I\nweren\u2019t like that.\u201d Her grip on the fridge\u2019s handle tightened, her knuckles\ngoing white. \u201cConnor and I\u2014Connor Holstrom, I mean. He and I \u2026\u201d She\ntrailed off. \u201cIt was complicated. When Danika died, when they all died \u2026 a\nlight went out in me.\u201d\nHe remembered the details about her and the elder of the Holstrom\nbrothers. Ithan hadn\u2019t been there that night, either\u2014and was now Second in\nAmelie Ravenscroft\u2019s pack. A sorry replacement for what the Pack of\nDevils had once been. This city had also lost something that night.\nHunt opened his mouth to tell Quinlan he understood. Not just the\ncomplicated relationship thing, but the loss. To wake up one morning\nsurrounded by friends and his lover\u2014and then to end the day with all of\nthem dead. He understood how it gnawed on bones and blood and the very\nsoul of a person. How nothing could ever make it right.\nHow cutting out the alcohol and the drugs, how refusing to do the\nthing she loved most\u2014the dancing\u2014still couldn\u2019t make it right. But the\nwords stalled in his throat. He hadn\u2019t felt like talking about it two hundred\nyears ago, and sure as Hel didn\u2019t feel like talking about it now.\nA landline phone somewhere in the house began ringing, and a\npleasant female voice trilled, Call from \u2026 Home.\nBryce closed her eyes, as if rallying herself, then padded down the\ndarkened hallway that led to her bedroom. A moment later, she said with a\ncheerfulness that should have earned her an award for Best Fucking Actor\nin Midgard, \u201cHey, Mom.\u201d A mattress groaned. \u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t there. My\nphone fell in the toilet at work\u2014yep, totally dead. I\u2019ll get a new one\ntomorrow. Yeah, I\u2019m fine. June wasn\u2019t there, either. We\u2019re all good.\u201d A\npause. \u201cI know\u2014it was just a long day at work.\u201d Another pause. \u201cLook,\nI\u2019ve got company.\u201d A rough laugh. \u201cNot that kind. Don\u2019t get your hopes up.\nI\u2019m serious. Yes, I let him into my house willingly. Please don\u2019t call the\nfront desk. His name? I\u2019m not telling you.\u201d Just the slightest hesitation.\n\u201cMom. I will call you tomorrow. I\u2019m not telling him hello. Bye\u2014bye, Mom.\nLove you.\u201d\nSyrinx had finished his food and was staring expectantly at Hunt\u2014\nsilently pleading for more, that lion\u2019s tail waggling. \u201cNo,\u201d he hissed at the\nbeast just as Bryce walked back into the main room.\n\u201cOh,\u201d she said, as if she\u2019d forgotten he was there. \u201cI\u2019m going to take a\nshower. Guest room is yours. Use whatever you need.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll swing by the Comitium tomorrow to get more clothes.\u201d Bryce just\nnodded like her head weighed a thousand pounds. \u201cWhy\u2019d you lie?\u201d He\u2019d\nlet her decide which one she wanted to explain.\nShe paused, Syrinx trotting ahead down the hall to her bedroom. \u201cMy\nmom would only worry and come visit. I don\u2019t want her around if things are\ngetting bad. And I didn\u2019t tell her who you were because that would lead to\nquestions, too. It\u2019s easier this way.\u201d\nEasier to not let herself enjoy life, easier to keep everyone at arm\u2019s\nlength.\nThe mark on her cheek from Juniper\u2019s slap had barely faded. Easier to\nthrow herself on top of a friend as a bomb exploded, rather than risk losing\nthem.\nShe said quietly, \u201cI need to find who did this, Hunt.\u201d\nHe met her raw, aching stare. \u201cI know.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said hoarsely. \u201cYou don\u2019t. I don\u2019t care what Micah\u2019s motives\nare\u2014if I don\u2019t find this fucking person, it is going to eat me alive.\u201d Not the\nmurderer or the demon, but the pain and grief that he was only starting to\nrealize dwelled inside her. \u201cI need to find who did this.\u201d\n\u201cWe will,\u201d he promised.\n\u201cHow can you know that?\u201d She shook her head.\n\u201cBecause we don\u2019t have another choice. I don\u2019t have another choice.\u201d\nAt her confused look, Hunt blew out a breath and said, \u201cMicah offered me a\ndeal.\u201d\nHer eyes turned wary. \u201cWhat sort of deal?\u201d\nHunt clenched his jaw. She\u2019d offered up a piece of herself, so he could\ndo the same. Especially if they were now gods-damned roommates. \u201cWhen\nI first came here, Micah offered me a bargain: if I could make up for every\nlife the 18th took that day on Mount Hermon, I\u2019d get my freedom back. All\ntwo thousand two hundred and seventeen lives.\u201d He steeled himself, willing\nher to hear what he couldn\u2019t quite say.\nShe chewed on her lip. \u201cI\u2019m assuming that make up means \u2026\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d he ground out. \u201cIt means doing what I\u2019m good at. A death for a\ndeath.\u201d\n\u201cMicah has more than two thousand people for you to assassinate?\u201d\nHunt let out a harsh laugh. \u201cMicah is a Governor of an entire territory,\nand he will live for at least another two hundred years. He\u2019ll probably have\ndouble that number of people on his shit list before he\u2019s done.\u201d Horror crept\ninto her eyes, and he scrambled for a way to get rid of it, unsure why. \u201cIt\ncomes with the job. His job, and mine.\u201d He ran a hand through his hair.\n\u201cLook, it\u2019s awful, but he offered me a way out, at least. And when the\nkillings started again, he offered me a different bargain: find the murderer\nbefore the Summit meeting, and he\u2019d reduce the debts I owe to ten.\u201d\nHe waited for her judgment, her disgust with him and Micah. But she\nangled her head. \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019ve been a bullish pain the ass.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said tightly. \u201cMicah ordered me not to say anything, though.\nSo if you breathe one word about it\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHis offer will be rescinded.\u201d\nHunt nodded, scanning her battered face. She said nothing more. After\na heartbeat, he demanded, \u201cWell?\u201d\n\u201cWell, what?\u201d She again began walking toward her bedroom.\n\u201cWell, aren\u2019t you going to say that I\u2019m a self-serving piece of shit?\u201d\nShe paused again, a faint ray of light entering her eyes. \u201cWhy bother,\nAthalar, when you just said it for me?\u201d\nHe couldn\u2019t help it then. Even though she was bloodied and covered in\ndebris, he looked her over. Every inch and curve. Tried not to think about\nthe hot-pink underwear beneath that tight green dress. But he said, \u201cI\u2019m\nsorry I thought you were a suspect. And more than that, I\u2019m sorry I judged\nyou. I thought you were just a party girl, and I acted like an asshole.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with being a party girl. I don\u2019t get why the\nworld thinks there is.\u201d But she considered his words. \u201cIt\u2019s easier for me\u2014\nwhen people assume the worst about what I am. It lets me see who they\nreally are.\u201d\n\u201cSo you\u2019re saying you think I\u2019m really an asshole?\u201d A corner of his\nmouth curled up.\nBut her eyes were dead serious. \u201cI\u2019ve met and dealt with a lot of\nassholes, Hunt. You\u2019re not one of them.\u201d\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t singing that tune earlier.\u201d\nShe just aimed for her room once more. So Hunt asked, \u201cWant me to\nget food?\u201d\nAgain, she paused. She looked like she was about to say no, but then\nrasped, \u201cCheeseburger\u2014with cheese fries. And a chocolate milkshake.\u201d\nHunt smiled. \u201cYou got it.\u201d\nThe elegant guest room on the other side of the kitchen was spacious,\ndecorated in shades of gray and cream accented with pale rose and\ncornflower blue. The bed was big enough for Hunt\u2019s wings, thankfully\u2014\ndefinitely bought with Vanir in mind\u2014and a few photos in expensive-\nlooking frames were propped next to a lopsided, chipped ceramic blue\nbowl, all adorning a chest of drawers to the right of the door.\nHe\u2019d gotten them both burgers and fries, and Bryce had torn into hers\nwith a ferocity that Hunt had seen only among lions gathered around a fresh\nkill. He\u2019d tossed the whining Syrinx a few fries under the white glass table,\nsince she sure as shit wasn\u2019t sharing anything.\nExhaustion had set in so thoroughly that neither of them spoke, and\nonce she\u2019d finished slurping down the milkshake, she\u2019d merely gathered up\nthe trash, dumped it into the bin, and headed to her room. Leaving Hunt to\nenter his.\nA mortal scent lingered that he assumed was courtesy of her parents,\nand as Hunt opened the drawers, he found some of them full of clothes\u2014\nlight sweaters, socks, pants, athletic-looking gear \u2026 He was snooping.\nGranted, it was part of the job description, but it was still snooping.\nHe shut the drawers and studied the framed photos.\nEmber Quinlan had been a knockout. No wonder that Fae asshole had\npursued her to the point where she\u2019d bailed. Long black hair framed a face\nthat could have been on a billboard: freckled skin, full lips, and high\ncheekbones that made the dark, depthless eyes above them striking.\nIt was Bryce\u2019s face\u2014the coloring was just different. An equally\nattractive brown-skinned, dark-haired human male stood beside her, arm\nslung around her slim shoulders, grinning like a fiend at whoever was\nbehind the camera. Hunt could just barely make out the writing on the silver\ndog tags dipping over the man\u2019s gray button-up.\nWell, holy shit.\nRandall Silago was Bryce\u2019s adoptive father? The legendary war hero\nand sharpshooter? He had no idea how he\u2019d missed that fact in her file,\nthough he supposed he had been skimming when he\u2019d read it years ago.\nNo wonder his daughter was so fearless. And there, to the right of\nEmber, stood Bryce.\nShe was barely past three, that red hair pulled high into two floppy\npigtails. Ember was looking at her daughter\u2014the expression a bit\nexasperated\u2014as if Bryce was supposed to be in the nice clothes that the two\nadults were wearing. But there she was, giving her mother an equally sassy\nlook, hands on her chubby hips, legs set apart in an unmistakable fighting\nstance. Covered head to toe in mud.\nHunt snickered and turned to the other photo on the dresser.\nIt was a beautiful shot of two women\u2014girls, really\u2014sitting on some\nred rocks atop a desert mountain, their backs to the camera, shoulder-to-\nshoulder as they faced the scrub and sand far below. One was Bryce\u2014he\ncould tell from her sheet of red hair. The other was in a familiar leather\njacket, the back painted with those words in the Republic\u2019s most ancient\nlanguage. Through love, all is possible.\nIt had to be Bryce and Danika. And\u2014that was Danika\u2019s jacket that\nBryce now wore.\nShe had no other photos of Danika in the apartment.\nThrough love, all is possible. It was an ancient saying, dating back to\nsome god he couldn\u2019t remember. Cthona, probably\u2014what with all the\nmother-goddess stuff she presided over. Hunt had long since stopped\nvisiting temples, or paying much attention to the overzealous priestesses\nwho popped up on the morning talk shows every now and then. None of the\nfive gods had ever helped him\u2014or anyone he cared about. Urd, especially,\nhad fucked him over often enough.\nDanika\u2019s blond ponytail draped down Bryce\u2019s back as she leaned her\nhead against her friend\u2019s shoulder. Bryce wore a loose white T-shirt,\nshowing a bandaged arm braced on her knee. Bruises peppered her body.\nAnd gods\u2014that was a sword lying to Danika\u2019s left. Sheathed and clean, but\n\u2014he knew that sword.\nSabine had gone ballistic searching for it when it was discovered to be\nmissing from the apartment where her daughter had been murdered.\nApparently it was some wolf heirloom. But there it lay, beside Bryce and\nDanika in the desert.\nSitting there on those rocks, perched over the world, they seemed like\ntwo soldiers who had just walked through the darkest halls of Hel and were\ntaking a well-earned break.\nHunt turned from the picture and rubbed at the tattoo on his brow. A\nflick of his power had the heavy gray curtains sliding shut over the floor-to-\nceiling windows on a chill wind. He peeled off his clothes one by one, and\nfound the bathroom was just as spacious as the bedroom.\nHunt showered quickly and fell into bed with his skin still drying. The\nlast thing he saw before sleep overtook him was the photo of Bryce and\nDanika, frozen forever in a moment of peace."}, "28": {"Name": "PART II THE TRENCH-Chapter 28", "Page Content": " 8 \nHunt woke the moment he scented a male in his room, his fingers wrapping\naround the knife under his pillow. He opened an eye, grip tightening on the\nhilt, remembering every window and doorway, every possible would-be\nweapon that he could wield to his advantage\u2014\nHe found Syrinx sitting on the pillow beside his, the chimera\u2019s\nsmooshed-up face peering into his own.\nHunt groaned, a breath exploding out of him. Syrinx just swatted at his\nface.\nHunt rolled out of reach. \u201cGood morning to you, too,\u201d he mumbled,\nscanning the room. He\u2019d definitely shut the door last night. It now gaped\nwide open. He glanced at the clock.\nSeven. He hadn\u2019t noticed Bryce get up for work\u2014hadn\u2019t heard her\nbuzzing about the apartment or the music he knew she liked to play.\nGranted, he hadn\u2019t heard his own door open, either. He\u2019d slept like the\ndead. Syrinx rested his head on Hunt\u2019s shoulder, and huffed a mournful\nsigh.\nSolas spare him. \u201cWhy do I get the feeling that if I give you breakfast,\nit\u2019ll actually be your second or third meal of the day?\u201d\nAn innocent blink of those round eyes.\nUnable to help himself, Hunt scratched the little beast behind his silly\nears.\nThe sunny apartment beyond his room was silent, the light warming\nthe pale wood floors. He eased from the bed, hauling on his pants. His shirt\nwas a wreck from last night\u2019s events, so he left it on the floor, and\u2014 Shit.\nHis phone. He grabbed it from the bedside table and flicked through the\nmessages. Nothing new, no missions from Micah, thank the gods.\nHe left the phone on the dresser beside the door and padded into the\ngreat room.\nNo sign or sound. If Quinlan had just left\u2014\nHe stormed across the space, to the hall on the other side. Her bedroom\ndoor was cracked, as if Syrinx had seen himself out, and\u2014\nSound asleep. The heap of blankets had been twisted and tossed\naround, and Quinlan lay belly-down on the bed, wrapped around a pillow.\nThe position was almost identical to the one she\u2019d been in last night in the\nclub, flung over Juniper.\nHunt was pretty sure most people would consider the low-backed gray\nnightgown, edged with pale pink lace, to be a shirt. Syrinx trotted past,\nleaping on the bed and nosing her bare shoulder.\nThe tattoo down her back\u2014scrolling, beautiful lines in some alphabet\nhe didn\u2019t recognize\u2014rose and fell with each deep breath. Bruises he hadn\u2019t\nnoted last night peppered her golden skin, already greenish thanks to the\nFae blood in her.\nAnd he was staring at her. Like a fucking creep.\nHunt twisted for the hall, his wings suddenly too big, his skin too tight,\nwhen the front door swung open. A smooth movement had his knife angled\nbehind him\u2014\nJuniper breezed in, a brown bag of what smelled like chocolate\npastries in one hand, a spare set of keys in another. She stopped dead as she\nspied him in the bedroom hallway.\nHer mouth popped open in a silent Oh.\nShe looked him over\u2014not in the way some females did until they\nnoted the tattoos, but in the way that told him she realized a half-naked\nmale stood in Bryce\u2019s apartment at seven in the morning.\nHe opened his mouth to say it wasn\u2019t how it looked, but Juniper just\nstrutted past, her delicate hooves clipping on the wood floors. She shoved\ninto the bedroom, jostling the bag, and Syrinx went wild, curly tail wagging\nas Juniper trilled, \u201cI brought chocolate croissants, so get that bare ass out of\nbed and into some pants.\u201d\nBryce lifted her head to see Juniper, then Hunt in the hall. She didn\u2019t\nbother to tug the hem of her nightgown over her teal lace underwear as she\nsquinted. \u201cWhat?\u201d\nJuniper strode to the bed and looked like she was about to plop onto it,\nbut glanced at him.\nHunt stiffened. \u201cIt\u2019s not what it seems.\u201d\nJuniper gave him a sweet smile. \u201cThen some privacy would be nice.\u201d\nHe backed down the hall, into the kitchen. Coffee. That sounded like a\ngood plan.\nHe opened a cabinet, fishing out some mugs. Their voices flitted out to\nhim anyway.\n\u201cI tried calling you, but your phone wasn\u2019t on\u2014I figured you probably\nlost it,\u201d Juniper said.\nBlankets rustled. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d\n\u201cTotally fine. News reports are still speculating, but they think human\nrebels from Pangera did it, wanting to start trouble here. There\u2019s video\nfootage from the loading dock that shows their insignia on a case of wine.\nThey think that\u2019s how the bomb got in.\u201d\nSo the theory had held overnight. Whether it was truly connected to\nthe Horn remained to be seen. Hunt made a note to check with Isaiah about\nthe request to meet with Briggs as soon as Juniper left.\n\u201cIs the Raven totally wrecked?\u201d\nA sigh. \u201cYeah\u2014really bad. No idea when it\u2019ll be open again. I finally\ngot a hold of Fury last night, and she said Riso\u2019s mad enough that he put a\nbounty on the head of whoever was responsible.\u201d\nNo surprise there. Hunt had heard that despite his laughing nature,\nwhen the butterfly shifter got pissed, he went all in. Juniper went on,\n\u201cFury\u2019s probably coming home because of it. You know she can\u2019t resist a\nchallenge.\u201d\nBurning Solas. Throwing Fury Axtar into this mess was a bad fucking\nidea. Hunt spooned coffee beans into the gleaming chrome machine built\ninto the kitchen wall.\nQuinlan asked tightly, \u201cSo she\u2019ll come back home for a bounty, but not\nto see us?\u201d\nA silence. Then, \u201cYou weren\u2019t the only one who lost Danika that night,\nB. We all dealt with it in different ways. Fury\u2019s answer to her pain was to\nbail.\u201d\n\u201cYour therapist tell you that?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not fighting with you about this again.\u201d\nMore silence. Juniper cleared her throat. \u201cB, I\u2019m sorry for what I did.\nYou\u2019ve got a bruise\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt is. I get it, I\u2014\u201d\nHunt turned on the machine\u2019s coffee grinder to give them some\nprivacy. He might have ground the beans into a fine powder instead of\nrough shards, but when he finished, Juniper was saying, \u201cSo, the gorgeous\nangel who\u2019s making you coffee right now\u2014\u201d\nHunt grinned at the coffee machine. It had been a long, long while\nsince anyone had bothered describing him as anything but Umbra Mortis,\nthe Knife of the Archangels.\n\u201cNo, no, and no,\u201d Bryce cut her off. \u201cJesiba is having me do a\nclassified job, and Hunt was assigned to protect me.\u201d\n\u201cIs being shirtless in your house part of that assignment?\u201d\n\u201cYou know how these Vanir males are. They live to show off their\nmuscles.\u201d\nHunt rolled his eyes as Juniper laughed. \u201cI\u2019m shocked you\u2019re even\nletting him stay here, B.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t really have a choice.\u201d\n\u201cHmmm.\u201d\nA thump of bare feet on the ground. \u201cYou know he\u2019s listening, right?\nHis feathers are probably so puffed up he won\u2019t be able to fit through the\ndoor.\u201d\nHunt leaned against the counter, the coffee machine doing the\ngrowling for him as Bryce stalked into the hallway. \u201cPuffed up?\u201d\nShe certainly hadn\u2019t bothered to fulfill her friend\u2019s pants request. Each\nstep had the pale pink lace of the nightgown\u2019s hem brushing against her\nupper thighs, tugging up slightly to reveal that thick, brutal scar on the left\nleg. His stomach twisted at the sight of what he\u2019d done to her.\n\u201cEyes up here, Athalar,\u201d she drawled. Hunt scowled.\nBut Juniper was following closely on Bryce\u2019s heels, her hooves\nclopping lightly on the wood floors as she held up the pastry bag. \u201cI just\nwanted to drop these off. I\u2019ve got rehearsal in \u2026\u201d She fished her phone\nfrom the pocket of her tight black leggings. \u201cOh shit. Now. Bye, B.\u201d She\nrushed to the door, chucking the pastry bag on the table with impressive\naim.\n\u201cGood luck\u2014call me later,\u201d Bryce said, already going to inspect her\nfriend\u2019s peace offering.\nJuniper lingered in the doorway long enough to say to him, \u201cDo your\njob, Umbra.\u201d\nThen she was gone.\nBryce slid into one of the white leather chairs at the glass table and\nsighed as she pulled out a chocolate croissant. She bit in and moaned. \u201cDo\nlegionaries eat croissants?\u201d\nHe remained leaning against the counter. \u201cIs that an actual question?\u201d\nCrunch-munch-swallow. \u201cWhy are you up so early?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s nearly seven thirty. Hardly early by anyone\u2019s count. But your\nchimera nearly sat on my face, so how could I not be up? And how many\npeople, exactly, have keys to this place?\u201d\nShe finished off her croissant. \u201cMy parents, Juniper, and the doorman.\nSpeaking of which \u2026 I need to give those keys back\u2014and get another copy\nmade.\u201d\n\u201cAnd get me a set.\u201d\nThe second croissant was halfway to her mouth when she set it down.\n\u201cNot going to happen.\u201d\nHe held her stare. \u201cYes, it is. And you\u2019ll change the enchantments so I\ncan get access\u2014\u201d\nShe bit into the croissant. \u201cIsn\u2019t it exhausting to be an alphahole all the\ntime? Do you guys have a handbook for it? Maybe secret support groups?\u201d\n\u201cAn alpha-what?\u201d\n\u201cAlphahole. Possessive and aggressive.\u201d She waved a hand at his bare\ntorso. \u201cYou know\u2014you males who rip your shirt off at the slightest\nprovocation, who know how to kill people in twenty different ways, who\nhave females falling over themselves to be with you; and when you finally\nbang one, you go full-on mating-frenzy with her, refusing to let another\nmale look at or talk to her, deciding what and when she needs to eat, what\nshe should wear, when she sees her friends\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhat the fuck are you talking about?\u201d\n\u201cYour favorite hobbies are brooding, fighting, and roaring; you\u2019ve\nperfected about thirty different types of snarls and growls; you\u2019ve got a\ncabal of hot friends, and the moment one of you mates, the others fall like\ndominoes, too, and gods help you when you all start having babies\u2014\u201d\nHe snatched the croissant out of her hand. That shut her up.\nBryce gaped at him, then at the pastry, and Hunt wondered if she\u2019d bite\nhim as he lifted it to his mouth. Damn, but it was good.\n\u201cOne,\u201d he told her, yanking over a chair and turning it backward for\nhim to straddle. \u201cThe last thing I want to do is fuck you, so we can take the\nwhole Sex, Mating, and Baby option off the table. Two, I don\u2019t have friends,\nso there sure as fuck will be no couples-retreat lifestyle anytime soon.\nThree, if we\u2019re complaining about people who are clothing-optional \u2026\u201d He\nfinished the croissant and gave her a pointed look. \u201cI\u2019m not the one who\nparades around this apartment in a bra and underwear every morning while\ngetting dressed.\u201d\nHe\u2019d worked hard to forget that particular detail. How after her\nmorning run, she did her hair and makeup in a routine that took her more\nthan an hour from start to finish. Wearing only what seemed to be an\nextensive, and rather spectacular, assortment of lingerie.\nHunt supposed if he looked the way she did, he\u2019d wear that shit, too.\nBryce only glared at him\u2014his mouth, his hand\u2014and grumbled, \u201cThat\nwas my croissant.\u201d\nThe coffee machine beeped, but he kept his ass planted in the chair.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to get me a new set of keys. And add me to the\nenchantments. Because it\u2019s part of my job, and being assertive isn\u2019t the first\nsign of being an alphahole\u2014it\u2019s a sign of me wanting to make sure you\ndon\u2019t wind up dead.\u201d\n\u201cStop cursing so much. You\u2019re upsetting Syrinx.\u201d\nHe leaned close enough to note gold flecks in her amber eyes. \u201cYou\nhave the dirtiest mouth I\u2019ve ever heard, sweetheart. And from the way you\nact, I think you might be the alphahole here.\u201d\nShe hissed.\n\u201cSee?\u201d he drawled. \u201cWhat was it you said? An assortment of snarls\nand growls?\u201d He waved a hand. \u201cWell, there you go.\u201d\nShe tapped her dusk-sky nails on the glass table. \u201cDon\u2019t ever eat my\ncroissant again. And stop calling me sweetheart.\u201d\nHunt threw her a smirk and rose. \u201cI need to head to the Comitium for\nmy clothes. Where are you going to be?\u201d\nBryce scowled and said nothing.\n\u201cThe answer,\u201d Hunt went on, \u201cis with me. Anywhere you or I go, we\ngo together from now on. Got it?\u201d\nShe flipped him off. But she didn\u2019t argue further."}, "29": {"Name": "PART II THE TRENCH-Chapter 29", "Page Content": " 9 \nMicah Domitus might have been an asshole, but at least he gave his triarii\nthe weekend off\u2014or its equivalent if a particular duty required them to\nwork through it.\nJesiba Roga, no surprise, didn\u2019t seem to believe in weekends. And\nsince Quinlan was expected at work, Hunt had decided they\u2019d hit the\nbarracks at the Comitium during lunch, while most people were distracted.\nThe thick veils of morning mist hadn\u2019t burned off by the time Hunt\ntrailed Bryce on her way to work. No new updates had been delivered to\nhim on the bombing, and there was no mention of further attacks that\nmatched the kristallos\u2019s usual methods.\nBut Hunt still kept his focus sharp, assessing every person who passed\nthe redhead below. Most people spotted Syrinx, prancing at the end of his\nleash, and gave her a healthy berth. Chimeras were volatile pets\u2014prone to\nsmall magics and biting. No matter that Syrinx seemed more interested in\nwhatever food he could swindle out of people.\nBryce wore a little black dress today, her makeup more subdued,\nheavier on the eyes, lighter on the lipstick \u2026 Armor, he realized as she and\nSyrinx wound through other commuters and tourists, dodging cars already\nhonking with impatience at the usual Old Square traffic. The clothes, the\nhair, the makeup\u2014they were like the leather and steel and guns he donned\nevery morning.\nExcept he didn\u2019t wear lingerie beneath it.\nFor whatever reason, he found himself dropping onto the cobblestones\nbehind her. She didn\u2019t so much as flinch, her sky-high black heels\nunfaltering. Impressive as Hel, for her to walk on the ancient streets without\nsnapping an ankle. Syrinx huffed his greeting and kept trotting, proud as an\nimperial parade horse. \u201cYour boss ever give you a day off?\u201d\nShe sipped from the coffee she balanced in her free hand. She drank a\nsurely illegal amount of the stuff throughout the day. Starting with no less\nthan three cups before they\u2019d left the apartment. \u201cI get Sundays off,\u201d she\nsaid. Palm fronds hissed in the chill breeze above them. The tan skin of her\nlegs pebbled with the cold. \u201cMany of our clients are busy enough that they\ncan\u2019t come in during the workweek. Saturday is their day of leisure.\u201d\n\u201cDo you get holidays off at least?\u201d\n\u201cThe store is closed on the major ones.\u201d She idly jangled the tri-knot\namulet around her neck.\nAn Archesian charm like that had to cost \u2026 Burning Solas, it had to\ncost a fuck-ton. Hunt thought about the heavy iron door to the archives.\nPerhaps it hadn\u2019t been put there to keep thieves out \u2026 but to keep things in.\nHe had a feeling she wouldn\u2019t tell him any details about why the art\nrequired her to wear such an amulet, so he instead asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the deal\nwith you and your cousin?\u201d Who would be arriving at the gallery at some\npoint this morning.\nBryce gently pulled on Syrinx\u2019s leash when he lunged for a squirrel\nscampering up a palm tree. \u201cRuhn and I were close for a few years when I\nwas a teenager, and then we had a big fight. I stopped speaking to him after\nthat. And things have been \u2026 well, you see how things are now.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019d you fight about?\u201d\nThe morning mist swirled past as she fell quiet, as if debating what to\nreveal. She said, \u201cIt started off as a fight about his father. What a piece of\nshit the Autumn King is, and how Ruhn was wrapped around his finger. It\ndevolved into a screaming match about each other\u2019s flaws. I walked out\nwhen Ruhn said that I was flirting with his friends like a shameless hussy\nand to stay away from them.\u201d\nRuhn had said far worse than that, Hunt recalled. At Luna\u2019s Temple,\nhe\u2019d heard Bryce refer to him calling her a half-breed slut. \u201cI\u2019ve always\nknown Danaan was an asshole, but even for him, that\u2019s low.\u201d\n\u201cIt was,\u201d she admitted softly, \u201cBut \u2026 honestly, I think he was being\nprotective of me. That\u2019s what the argument was about, really. He was acting\nlike every other domineering Fae asshole out there. And just like my\nfather.\u201d\nHunt asked, \u201cYou ever have contact with him?\u201d There were a few\ndozen Fae nobles that might be monstrous enough to have prompted Ember\nQuinlan to bail all those years ago.\n\u201cOnly when I can\u2019t avoid it. I think I hate him more than anyone else\nin Midgard. Except for Sabine.\u201d She sighed skyward, watching angels and\nwitches zoom past above the buildings around them. \u201cWho\u2019s number one\non your shit list?\u201d\nHunt waited until they\u2019d passed a reptilian-looking Vanir typing on\ntheir phone before he replied, mindful of every camera mounted on the\nbuildings or hidden in trees or garbage cans. \u201cSandriel.\u201d\n\u201cAh.\u201d Only Sandriel\u2019s first name was necessary for anyone on\nMidgard. \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve seen on TV, she seems \u2026\u201d Bryce grimaced.\n\u201cWhatever you\u2019ve seen is the pleasant version. The reality is ten times\nworse. She\u2019s a sadistic monster.\u201d To say the least. He added, \u201cI was forced\nto \u2026 work for her for more than half a century. Until Micah.\u201d He couldn\u2019t\nsay the word\u2014owned. He\u2019d never let Sandriel have that kind of power over\nhim. \u201cShe and the commander of her triarii, Pollux, take cruelty and\npunishment to new levels.\u201d He clenched his jaw, shaking off the blood-\nsoaked memories. \u201cThey\u2019re not stories to tell on a busy street.\u201d Or at all.\nBut she eyed him. \u201cYou ever want to talk about it, Athalar, I\u2019m here.\u201d\nShe said it casually, but he could read the sincerity in her face. He\nnodded. \u201cLikewise.\u201d\nThey passed the Old Square Gate, tourists already queued to take\nphotos or touch the disk on the dial pad, gleefully handing over a drop of\ntheir power as they did so. None seemed aware of the body that had been\nfound a few blocks away. In the drifting mist, the quartz Gate was almost\nethereal, like it had been carved from ancient ice. Not one rainbow graced\nthe buildings around it\u2014not in the fog.\nSyrinx sniffed at a trash can overflowing with food waste from the\nstands around the square. \u201cYou ever touch the disk and make a wish?\u201d\nBryce asked.\nHe shook his head. \u201cI thought it was something only kids and tourists\ndid.\u201d\n\u201cIt is. But it\u2019s fun.\u201d She tossed her hair over a shoulder, smiling to\nherself. \u201cI made a wish here when I was thirteen\u2014when I visited the city\nfor the first time. Ruhn took me.\u201d\nHunt lifted a brow. \u201cWhat\u2019d you wish for?\u201d\n\u201cFor my boobs to get bigger.\u201d\nA laugh burst out of him, chasing away any lingering shadows that talk\nof Sandriel dragged up. But Hunt avoided looking at Bryce\u2019s chest as he\nsaid, \u201cSeems your wish paid off, Quinlan.\u201d Understatement. Big, fucking,\nlace-covered understatement.\nShe chuckled. \u201cCrescent City: Where dreams come true.\u201d\nHunt elbowed her ribs, unable to stop himself from making physical\ncontact.\nShe batted him away. \u201cWhat would you wish for, if you knew it\u2019d\ncome true?\u201d\nFor his mother to be alive and safe and happy. For Sandriel and Micah\nand all the Archangels and Asteri to be dead. For his bargain with Micah to\nbe over and the halo and slave tattoos removed. For the rigid hierarchies of\nthe malakim to come crashing down.\nBut he couldn\u2019t say any of that. Wasn\u2019t ready to say those things aloud\nto her.\nSo Hunt said, \u201cSince I\u2019m perfectly happy with the size of my assets,\nI\u2019d wish for you to stop being such a pain in my ass.\u201d\n\u201cJerk.\u201d But Bryce grinned, and damn if the morning sun didn\u2019t finally\nmake an appearance at the sight of it.\nThe library beneath Griffin Antiquities would have made even the Autumn\nKing jealous.\nRuhn Danaan sat at the giant worktable in its heart, still needing a\nmoment to take in the space\u2014and the fire sprite who\u2019d batted her eyelashes\nand asked if all his piercings had hurt.\nBryce and Athalar sat on the other side of the table, the former typing\nat a laptop, the latter leafing through a pile of old tomes. Lehabah lay on\nwhat seemed to be a doll\u2019s fainting couch, a digital tablet propped up before\nher, watching one of the more popular Vanir dramas.\n\u201cSo,\u201d Bryce said without glancing up from the computer, \u201care you\ngoing to look around or sit there and gawk?\u201d\nAthalar snickered, but said nothing, his finger tracing over a line of\ntext.\nRuhn glared at him. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\n\u201cResearching the kristallos,\u201d Hunt said, his dark eyes lifting from the\nbook. \u201cI\u2019ve killed about a dozen Type-Six demons over the centuries, and I\nwant to see if there are any similarities.\u201d\n\u201cIs the kristallos a Type-Six?\u201d Ruhn asked.\n\u201cI\u2019m assuming it is,\u201d Hunt replied, studying the book again. \u201cType-\nSeven is only for the princes themselves, and given what this thing can do,\nI\u2019d bet it\u2019d be deemed a Six.\u201d He drummed his fingers on the ancient page.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen any similarities, though.\u201d\nBryce hummed. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re looking in the wrong spot. Maybe \u2026\u201d\nShe angled her laptop toward Athalar, fingers flying. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for\ninfo on something that hasn\u2019t entered this world in fifteen thousand years.\nThe fact that no one could ID it suggests it might not have made it into\nmany of the history books, and only a handful of those books survived this\nlong. But \u2026\u201d More typing, and Ruhn craned his neck to see the database\nshe pulled up. \u201cWhere are we right now?\u201d she asked Athalar.\n\u201cA library.\u201d\n\u201cAn antiquities gallery, dumbass.\u201d A page loaded, full of images of\nancient vases and amphorae, mosaics, and statues. She\u2019d typed demon +\nFae into the search bar. Bryce slid the laptop to Hunt. \u201cMaybe we can find\nthe kristallos in ancient art.\u201d\nHunt grumbled, but Ruhn noted the impressed gleam in his eyes before\nhe began scanning through the pages of results.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never met a prince before,\u201d Lehabah sighed from the couch.\n\u201cThey\u2019re overrated,\u201d Ruhn said over a shoulder.\nAthalar grunted his agreement.\n\u201cWhat is it like,\u201d the sprite asked, propping her fiery head on a burning\nfist, \u201cto be the Chosen One?\u201d\n\u201cBoring,\u201d Ruhn admitted. \u201cBeyond the sword and some party tricks,\nthere\u2019s not much to it.\u201d\n\u201cCan I see the Starsword?\u201d\n\u201cI left it at home. I didn\u2019t feel like having to deal with tourists stopping\nme on every block, wanting to take pictures.\u201d\n\u201cPoor little prince,\u201d Bryce cooed.\nHunt grunted his agreement again, and Ruhn bit out, \u201cYou got\nsomething to say, Athalar?\u201d\nThe angel\u2019s eyes lifted from the laptop. \u201cShe said it all.\u201d\nRuhn snarled, but Bryce asked, surveying them, \u201cWhat\u2019s the deal with\nyou two?\u201d\n\u201cOh, do tell,\u201d Lehabah pleaded, pausing her show to perk up on the\ncouch.\nHunt went back to perusing the results. \u201cWe beat the shit out of each\nother at a party. Danaan\u2019s still sore about it.\u201d\nBryce\u2019s grin was the definition of shit-eating. \u201cWhy\u2019d you fight?\u201d\nRuhn snapped, \u201cBecause he\u2019s an arrogant asshole.\u201d\n\u201cLikewise,\u201d Hunt said, mouth curling in a half smile.\nBryce threw Lehabah a knowing look. \u201cBoys and their pissing\ncontests.\u201d\nLehabah made a prim little sound. \u201cNot nearly as advanced as us\nladies.\u201d\nRuhn rolled his eyes, surprised to find Athalar doing the same.\nBryce gestured to the endless shelves that filled the library. \u201cWell,\ncousin,\u201d she said, \u201chave at it. Let your Starborn powers guide you to\nenlightenment.\u201d\n\u201cFunny,\u201d he said, but began walking toward the shelves, scanning the\ntitles. He paused at the various tanks and terrariums built into the\nbookcases, the small animals within wholly uninterested in his presence. He\ndidn\u2019t dare ask if the rumors about them were true, especially not when\nLehabah called over from her couch, \u201cThe tortoise is named Marlene.\u201d\nRuhn gave his sister an alarmed look, but Bryce was doing something\non her phone.\nMusic began playing a moment later, trickling in from speakers hidden\nin the wood panels. Ruhn listened to the first strains of the song\u2014just a\nguitar and two soaring, haunting female voices. \u201cYou\u2019re still into this\nband?\u201d As a kid, she\u2019d been obsessed with the sister folk duo.\n\u201cJosie and Laurel keep making good music, so I keep listening.\u201d She\nswiped at her phone.\nRuhn continued his idle browsing. \u201cYou always had really good taste.\u201d\nHe tossed it out there\u2014a rope into the stormy sea that was their\nrelationship.\nShe didn\u2019t look up, but she said a shade quietly, \u201cThanks.\u201d\nAthalar, wisely, didn\u2019t say a word.\nRuhn scanned the shelves, waiting to feel a tug toward anything\nbeyond the sister who\u2019d spoken more to him in the past few days than she\nhad in nine years. The titles were in the common language, the Old\nLanguage of the Fae, the mer, and a few other alphabets he didn\u2019t\nrecognize. \u201cThis collection is amazing.\u201d\nRuhn reached for a blue tome whose spine glittered with gold foil.\nWords of the Gods.\n\u201cDon\u2019t touch it,\u201d Lehabah warned. \u201cIt might bite.\u201d\nRuhn snatched back his hand as the book stirred, rumbling on the\nshelf. His shadows murmured inside him, readying to strike. He willed\nthem to settle. \u201cWhy does the book move?\u201d\n\u201cBecause they\u2019re special\u2014\u201d Lehabah began.\n\u201cEnough, Lele,\u201d Bryce warned. \u201cRuhn, don\u2019t touch anything without\npermission.\u201d\n\u201cFrom you or the book?\u201d\n\u201cBoth,\u201d she said. As if in answer, a book high up on the shelf rustled.\nRuhn craned his head to look, and saw a green tome \u2026 shining. Beckoning.\nHis shadows murmured, as if in urging. All right, then.\nIt was a matter of moments to drag over the brass ladder and scale it.\nBryce said, seemingly to the library itself, \u201cDon\u2019t bother him,\u201d before Ruhn\npulled the book from its resting place. He rolled his eyes at the title. Great\nRomances of the Fae.\nStarborn power indeed. Tucking the book into the crook of his arm, he\ndescended the ladder and returned to the table.\nBryce choked on a laugh at the title. \u201cYou sure that Starborn power\nisn\u2019t for finding smut?\u201d She called to Lehabah, \u201cThis one\u2019s right up your\nalley.\u201d\nLehabah burned to a raspberry pink. \u201cBB, you\u2019re horrible.\u201d\nAthalar winked at him. \u201cEnjoy.\u201d\n\u201cI will,\u201d Ruhn shot back, flipping open the book. His phone buzzed\nbefore he could begin. He fished it from his back pocket and glanced at the\nscreen. \u201cDec\u2019s got the intel you wanted.\u201d\nBryce and Athalar went still. Ruhn opened the email, then his fingers\nhovered over the forwarding screen. \u201cI, uh \u2026 is your email still the same?\u201d\nhe asked her. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t have yours, Athalar.\u201d\nHunt rattled his off, but Bryce frowned at Ruhn for a long moment, as\nif weighing whether she wanted to open yet another door into her life. She\nthen sighed and answered, \u201cYes, it\u2019s the same.\u201d\n\u201cSent,\u201d Ruhn said, and opened up the attachment Declan had emailed\nover.\nIt was full of coordinates and their correlating locations. Danika\u2019s daily\nroutine as Alpha of the Pack of Devils had her moving throughout the Old\nSquare and beyond. Not to mention her healthy social life after sundown.\nThe list covered everything from the apartment, the Den, the City Head\noffice at the Comitium, a tattoo parlor, a burger joint, too many pizza places\nto count, bars, a concert venue, the CCU sunball arena, hair salons, the gym\n\u2026 Fuck, had she ever gotten any sleep? The list dated back two weeks prior\nto her death. From the silence around the table, he knew Bryce and Hunt\nwere also skimming over the locations. Then\u2014\nSurprise lit Hunt\u2019s dark eyes as he looked to her. Bryce murmured,\n\u201cDanika wasn\u2019t merely on duty near Luna\u2019s Temple around that time\u2014this\nsays Danika was stationed at the temple for the two days before the Horn\nwas stolen. And during the night of the blackout.\u201d\nHunt asked, \u201cYou think she saw whoever took it and they killed her to\ncover it up?\u201d\nCould it be that easy? Ruhn prayed it was.\nBryce shook her head. \u201cIf Danika saw the Horn being stolen, she\nwould have reported it.\u201d She sighed again. \u201cDanika wasn\u2019t usually stationed\nat the temple, but Sabine often switched her schedule around for spite.\nMaybe Danika had some of the Horn\u2019s scent on her from being on duty and\nthe demon tracked her down.\u201d\n\u201cGo through it again,\u201d Ruhn urged. \u201cMaybe there\u2019s something you\u2019re\nmissing.\u201d\nBryce\u2019s mouth twisted to the side, the portrait of skepticism, but Hunt\nsaid, \u201cBetter than nothing.\u201d Bryce held the angel\u2019s stare for longer than\nmost people deemed wise.\nNothing good could come of it\u2014Bryce and Athalar working together.\nLiving together.\nBut Ruhn kept his mouth shut, and began reading.\n\u201cAny good sex scenes yet?\u201d Bryce asked Ruhn idly, going over Danika\u2019s\nlocation data for the third time. The first few of those locations, she\u2019d\nrealized, had been to Philip Briggs\u2019s bomb lab just outside the city walls.\nIncluding the night of the bust itself.\nShe still remembered Danika and Connor limping into the apartment\nthat night, after making the bust on Briggs and his Keres group two years\nago. Danika had been fine, but Connor had sported a split lip and black eye\nthat screamed some shit had gone down. They never told her what, and she\nhadn\u2019t asked. She\u2019d just made Connor sit at that piece-of-shit kitchen table\nand let her clean him up.\nHe\u2019d kept his eyes fixed on her face, her mouth, the entire time she\u2019d\ngently dabbed his lip. She\u2019d known then and there that it was coming\u2014that\nConnor was done waiting. That five years of friendship, of dancing around\neach other, was now going to change, and he\u2019d make his move soon. It\ndidn\u2019t matter that she\u2019d been dating Reid. Connor had let her take care of\nhim, his eyes near-glowing, and she\u2019d known it was time.\nWhen Ruhn didn\u2019t immediately respond to her taunting, Bryce looked\nup from the laptop. Her brother had kept reading\u2014and didn\u2019t seem to hear\nher. \u201cRuhn.\u201d\nHunt halted his own searching through the gallery database. \u201cDanaan.\u201d\nRuhn snapped his head up, blinking. Bryce asked, \u201cYou found\nsomething?\u201d\n\u201cYes and no,\u201d Ruhn said, sitting back in his chair. \u201cThis is just a three-\npage account of Prince Pelias and his bride, Lady Helena. But I didn\u2019t\nrealize that Pelias was actually the high general for a Fae Queen named\nTheia when they entered this world during the Crossing\u2014and Helena was\nher daughter. From what it sounds like, Queen Theia was also Starborn, and\nher daughter possessed the same power. Theia had a younger daughter with\nthe same gift, but only Lady Helena gets mentioned.\u201d Ruhn cleared his\nthroat and read, \u201cNight-haired Helena, from whose golden skin poured\nstarlight and shadows. It seems like Pelias was one of several Fae back then\nwith the Starborn power.\u201d\nBryce blinked. \u201cSo? What does it have to do with the Horn?\u201d\n\u201cIt mentions here that the sacred objects were made only for Fae like\nthem. That the Horn worked only when that starlight flowed through it,\nwhen it was filled with power. This claims that the Starborn magic, in\naddition to a bunch of other crap, can be channeled through the sacred\nobjects\u2014bringing them to life. I sure as fuck have never been able to do\nanything like that, even with the Starsword. But it says that\u2019s why the\nPrince of the Pit had to steal Pelias\u2019s blood to make the kristallos to hunt the\nHorn\u2014it contained that essence. I think the Horn could have been wielded\nby any of them, though.\u201d\nHunt said, \u201cBut if the Prince of the Pit had gotten his hands on the\nHorn, he wouldn\u2019t be able to use it unless he had a Starborn Fae to operate\nit.\u201d He nodded to Ruhn. \u201cEven if whoever wants the Horn now finds it,\nthey\u2019d have to use you.\u201d\nRuhn considered. \u201cBut let\u2019s not forget that whoever is summoning the\ndemon to track the Horn\u2014and kill these people\u2014doesn\u2019t have the Horn.\nSomeone else stole it. So we\u2019re essentially looking for two different people:\nthe killer and whoever has the Horn.\u201d\n\u201cWell, the Horn is broken anyway,\u201d Bryce said.\nRuhn tapped the book. \u201cPermanently broken, apparently. It says here\nthat once it was cracked, the Fae claimed it could only be repaired by light\nthat is not light; magic that is not magic. Basically a convoluted way of\nsaying there\u2019s no chance in Hel of it ever working again.\u201d\nHunt said, \u201cSo we need to find out why someone would want it, then.\u201d\nHe frowned at Ruhn. \u201cYour father wants it for what\u2014some Fae PR\ncampaign about the good old days of Faedom?\u201d\nRuhn snorted, and Bryce smiled slightly. With lines like that, Athalar\nwas in danger of becoming one of her favorite people. Ruhn said,\n\u201cBasically, yeah. The Fae have been declining, according to him, for the\npast several thousand years. He claims our ancestors could burn entire\nforests to ash with half a thought\u2014while he can probably torch a grove, and\nnot much more.\u201d Ruhn\u2019s jaw tightened. \u201cIt drives him nuts that my Chosen\nOne powers are barely more than a kernel.\u201d\nBryce knew her own lack of power had been part of her father\u2019s\ndisgust with her.\nProof of the Fae\u2019s failing influence.\nShe felt Hunt\u2019s eyes on her, as if he could sense the bitterness that\nrippled through her. She half lied to him, \u201cMy own father never had a lick\nof interest in me for the same reason.\u201d\n\u201cEspecially after your visit to the Oracle,\u201d Ruhn said.\nHunt\u2019s brows rose, but Bryce shook her head at him, scowling. \u201cIt\u2019s a\nlong story.\u201d\nHunt again looked at her in that considering, all-seeing way. So Bryce\npeered over at Ruhn\u2019s tome, skimmed a few lines, and then looked back up\nat Ruhn. \u201cThis whole section is about your fancy Avallen cousins. Shadow-\nwalking, mind-reading \u2026 I\u2019m surprised they don\u2019t claim they\u2019re Starborn.\u201d\n\u201cThey wish they were,\u201d Ruhn muttered. \u201cThey\u2019re a bunch of pricks.\u201d\nShe had a vague memory of Ruhn telling her the details about why,\nexactly, he felt that way, but asked, \u201cNo mind-reading for you?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s mind-speaking,\u201d he grumbled, \u201cand it has nothing to do with the\nStarborn stuff. Or this case.\u201d\nHunt, apparently, seemed to agree, because he cut in, \u201cWhat if we\nasked the Oracle about the Horn? Maybe she could see why someone would\nwant a broken relic.\u201d\nBryce and Ruhn straightened. But she said, \u201cWe\u2019d be better off going\nto the mystics.\u201d\nHunt cringed. \u201cThe mystics are some dark, fucked-up shit. We\u2019ll try\nthe Oracle first.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m not going,\u201d Bryce said quickly.\nHunt\u2019s eyes darkened. \u201cBecause of what happened at your visit?\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d she said tightly.\nRuhn cut in and said to Hunt, \u201cYou go, then.\u201d\nHunt snickered. \u201cYou have a bad experience, too, Danaan?\u201d\nBryce found herself carefully watching her brother. Ruhn had never\nmentioned the Oracle to her. But he just shrugged and said, \u201cYeah.\u201d\nHunt threw up his hands. \u201cFine, assholes. I\u2019ll go. I\u2019ve never been. It\nalways seemed too gimmicky.\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t. Bryce blocked out the image of the golden sphinx who\u2019d sat\nbefore the hole in the floor of her dim, black chamber\u2014how that human\nwoman\u2019s face had monitored her every breath.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll need an appointment,\u201d she managed to say.\nSilence fell. A buzzing interrupted it, and Hunt sighed as he pulled out\nhis phone. \u201cI gotta take this,\u201d he said, and didn\u2019t wait for them to reply\nbefore striding up the stairs out of the library. A moment later, the front door\nto the gallery shut.\nWith Lehabah still watching her show behind them, Ruhn quietly said\nto Bryce, \u201cYour power levels never mattered to me, Bryce. You know that,\nright?\u201d\nShe went back to looking through Danika\u2019s data. \u201cYeah. I know.\u201d She\nlifted an eyebrow. \u201cWhat\u2019s your deal with the Oracle?\u201d\nHis face shuttered. \u201cNothing. She told me everything the Autumn King\nwanted to hear.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2014you\u2019re upset that it wasn\u2019t something as disastrous as mine?\u201d\nRuhn rose from his seat, piercings glittering in the firstlights. \u201cLook,\nI\u2019ve got an Aux meeting this afternoon that I need to prep for, but I\u2019ll see\nyou later.\u201d\n\u201cSure.\u201d\nRuhn paused, as if debating saying something else, but continued\ntoward the stairs and out.\n\u201cYour cousin is dreamy,\u201d Lehabah sighed from her couch.\n\u201cI thought Athalar was your one true love,\u201d Bryce said.\n\u201cCan\u2019t they both be?\u201d\n\u201cConsidering how terrible they are at sharing, I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll end\nwell for any of you.\u201d\nHer email pinged on the laptop. Since her phone was in shards in the\nrubble of the Raven, Hunt had emailed, Saw your cousin leave. We\u2019re\nheading to the Comitium in five minutes.\nShe wrote back, Don\u2019t give me orders, Athalar.\nFour minutes, sweetheart.\nI told you: don\u2019t call me sweetheart.\nThree minutes.\nGrowling, she stood from the table, rubbing her leg. Her heels were\nalready killing her, and knowing Athalar, he\u2019d make her walk the entire\nComitium complex. Her dress would look ridiculous with a different set of\nshoes, but fortunately, she kept a change of clothes in the bottom drawer of\nthe library desk, mostly in case of a rainy day that threatened to ruin\nwhatever she was wearing.\nLehabah said, \u201cIt\u2019s nice\u2014to have company down here.\u201d\nSomething in Bryce\u2019s chest wrenched, but she said, \u201cI\u2019ll be back later.\u201d"}, "30": {"Name": "PART II THE TRENCH-Chapter 30", "Page Content": " 0 \nHunt kept a casual distance from Bryce as she walked beside him through\nthe Comitium lobby to the bank of elevators that would take them up to the\n33rd\u2019s barracks. The other elevator bays dispersed through the centralized,\nglass-enclosed atrium led to the four other towers of the complex: one for\nthe City Heads\u2019 meeting rooms and the running of Lunathion, one for\nMicah as both residence and official office, one for general administrative\nbullshit, and one for public meetings and events. Thousands upon thousands\nof people lived and worked within its walls, but even with the bustling\nlobby, Quinlan somehow managed to stand out.\nShe\u2019d changed into red suede flats and a button-up white blouse tucked\ninto tight jeans, and tied her silken mass of hair into a high ponytail that\nswayed sassily with every step she took, matching Hunt stride for stride.\nHe placed his palm against the round disk next to the elevator doors,\nclearing him for access to his floor thirty levels up. Usually, he flew to the\nbarracks\u2019 landing balcony\u2014half for ease, half to avoid the busybodies who\nwere now gawking at them across the lobby floor, no doubt wondering if\nHunt was bringing Quinlan here to fuck her or interrogate her.\nThe legionary who lounged on a low-lying couch wasn\u2019t particularly\nskilled in stealing covert glances at her ass. Bryce looked over a shoulder,\nas if some extra sense told her someone was watching, and gave the soldier\na smile.\nThe legionary stiffened. Bryce bit her lower lip, her lashes lowering\nslightly.\nHunt punched the elevator button, hard, even as the male gave Bryce a\nhalf smile Hunt was pretty sure the bastard threw at any female who came\nhis way. As low-level grunts in a very large machine, legionaries\u2014even\nthose in the famed 33rd\u2014couldn\u2019t be picky.\nThe elevator doors opened, and legionaries and business types filed\nout, those without wings careful not to step on anyone\u2019s feathers. And all of\nthem careful not to look Hunt in the eye.\nIt wasn\u2019t that he was unfriendly. If someone offered him a smile, he\nusually made an attempt at returning it. But they\u2019d all heard the stories. All\nknew whom he worked for\u2014every one of his masters\u2014and what he did for\nthem.\nThey\u2019d be more comfortable getting into an elevator with a starved\ntiger.\nSo Hunt kept back, minimizing any chance of contact. Bryce whirled\nto face the elevator, that ponytail nearly whipping him in the face.\n\u201cWatch that thing,\u201d Hunt snapped as the elevator finally emptied and\nthey walked in. \u201cYou\u2019ll take my eye out.\u201d\nShe leaned nonchalantly against the far glass wall. Mercifully, no one\ngot inside with them. Hunt wasn\u2019t stupid enough to think that it was by pure\nchance.\nThey\u2019d made only one stop on their way here, to buy her a\nreplacement phone for the one she\u2019d lost at the club. She\u2019d even coughed\nup a few extra marks for a standard protection spell package on the phone.\nThe glass-and-chrome store had been mostly empty, but he hadn\u2019t\nfailed to notice how many would-be shoppers spied him through the\nwindows and kept far away. Bryce hadn\u2019t seemed to notice, and while\nthey\u2019d waited for the employee to bring out a new phone for her, she\u2019d\nasked him for his own, so she could trawl the news feeds for any updates on\nthe club attack. Somehow, she\u2019d wound up going through his photos. Or\nlack of them.\n\u201cThere are thirty-six photos on this phone,\u201d she said flatly.\nHunt had frowned. \u201cSo?\u201d\nShe scrolled through the paltry collection. \u201cGoing back four years.\u201d To\nwhen he\u2019d arrived in Lunathion and gotten his first phone and taste of life\nwithout a monster ruling over him. Bryce had gagged as she opened a photo\nof a severed leg on a bloody carpet. \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d\n\u201cI sometimes get called to crime scenes and have to snap a few for\nevidence.\u201d\n\u201cAre any of these people from your bargain with\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t take pictures of them.\u201d\n\u201cThere are thirty-six photos on your four-year-old phone, and all of\nthem are of dismembered bodies,\u201d she said. Someone gasped across the\nstore.\nHunt gritted his teeth. \u201cSay it a little louder, Quinlan.\u201d\nShe frowned. \u201cYou never take any others?\u201d\n\u201cOf what?\u201d\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know\u2014of life? A pretty flower or good meal or\nsomething?\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the point?\u201d\nShe\u2019d blinked, then shook her head. \u201cWeirdo.\u201d\nAnd before he could stop her, she\u2019d angled his phone in front of her,\nbeamed from ear to ear, and snapped a photo of herself before she handed it\nback to him. \u201cThere. One non-corpse photo.\u201d\nHunt had rolled his eyes, but pocketed the phone.\nThe elevator hummed around them, shooting upward. Bryce watched\nthe numbers rise. \u201cDo you know who that legionary was?\u201d she asked\ncasually.\n\u201cWhich one? There was the one drooling on the Traskian carpet, the\none with his tongue rolled out on the floor, or the one who was staring at\nyour ass like it was going to talk to him?\u201d\nShe laughed. \u201cThey must keep you all starved for sex in these barracks\nif the presence of one female sends them into such a tizzy. So\u2014do you\nknow his name? The one who wanted to have a chat with my ass.\u201d\n\u201cNo. There are three thousand of us in the 33rd alone.\u201d He glanced at\nher sidelong, watching her monitor the rising floor numbers. \u201cMaybe some\nguy that checks out your ass before he says hello isn\u2019t someone worth\nknowing.\u201d\nHer brows lifted as the elevator stopped and the doors opened. \u201cThat is\nprecisely the kind of person I\u2019m looking for.\u201d She stepped into the simple\nhallway, and he followed her\u2014realizing as she paused that he knew where\nthey were going, and she only faked it.\nHe turned left. Their footsteps echoed off the tan granite tile of the\nlong corridor. The stone was cracked and chipped in spots\u2014from dropped\nweapons, magical pissing contests, actual brawls\u2014but still polished enough\nthat he could see both their reflections.\nQuinlan took in the hall, the names on each door. \u201cMales only, or are\nyou mixed?\u201d\n\u201cMixed,\u201d he told her. \u201cThough there are more males than females in\nthe 33rd.\u201d\n\u201cDo you have a girlfriend? Boyfriend? Someone whose ass you gawk\nat?\u201d\nHe shook his head, trying to fight the ice in his veins as he stopped\nbefore his door, opened it, and let her inside. Trying to block out the image\nof Shahar plunging to the earth, Sandriel\u2019s sword through her sternum, both\nangels\u2019 white wings streaming blood. Both sisters screaming, faces nearly\nmirror images of each other. \u201cI was born a bastard.\u201d He shut the door\nbehind them, watching her survey the small room. The bed was big enough\nto fit his wings, but there wasn\u2019t space for much else beyond an armoire and\ndresser, a desk stacked with books and papers, and discarded weapons.\n\u201cSo?\u201d\n\u201cSo my mother had no money, and no distinguished bloodline that\nmight have made up for it. I don\u2019t exactly have females lining up for me,\ndespite this face of mine.\u201d His laugh was bitter as he opened the cheap pine\narmoire and pulled out a large duffel. \u201cI had someone once, someone who\ndidn\u2019t care about status, but it didn\u2019t end well.\u201d Each word singed his\ntongue.\nBryce wrapped her arms around herself, nails digging into the filmy\nsilk of her shirt. She seemed to realize whom he\u2019d alluded to. She glanced\naround, as if casting for things to say, and somehow settled on, \u201cWhen did\nyou make the Drop?\u201d\n\u201cI was twenty-eight.\u201d\n\u201cWhy then?\u201d\n\u201cMy mother had just died.\u201d Sorrow filled her eyes, and he couldn\u2019t\nstand the look, couldn\u2019t stand to open up the wound, so he added, \u201cI was\nreeling afterward. So I got a public Anchor and made the Drop. But it didn\u2019t\nmake a difference. If I\u2019d inherited the power of an Archangel or a\ndormouse, once the tattoos got inked on me five years later, it cut me off at\nthe knees.\u201d\nHe could hear her hand stroke his blanket. \u201cYou ever regret the angels\u2019\nrebellion?\u201d\nHunt glanced over a shoulder to find her leaning against the bed. \u201cNo\none\u2019s ever asked me that.\u201d No one dared. But she held his stare. Hunt\nadmitted, \u201cI don\u2019t know what I think.\u201d\nHe let his stare convey the rest. And I wouldn\u2019t say a fucking word\nabout it in this place.\nShe nodded. Then looked at the walls\u2014no artwork, no posters. \u201cNot\none to decorate?\u201d\nHe stuffed clothes into the duffel, remembering she had a washing\nmachine in the apartment. \u201cMicah can trade me whenever he wants. It\u2019s\nasking for bad luck to put down roots like that.\u201d\nShe rubbed her arms, even though the room was warm, almost stuffy.\n\u201cIf he\u2019d died that night, what would have happened to you? To every Fallen\nand slave he owns?\u201d\n\u201cOur deed of ownership passes on to whoever replaces him.\u201d He hated\nevery word out of his mouth. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t have anyone listed, the assets\nget divided among the other Archangels.\u201d\n\u201cWho wouldn\u2019t honor his bargain with you.\u201d\n\u201cDefinitely not.\u201d Hunt started on the weapons stashed in his desk\ndrawers.\nHe could feel her watching his every movement, as if counting each\nblade and gun he pulled out. She asked, \u201cIf you achieved your freedom,\nwhat would you do?\u201d\nHunt checked the ammo for the guns he had on his desk, and she\nwandered over to watch. He tossed a few into his bag. She picked up a long\nknife as if it were a dirty sock. \u201cI heard your lightning is unique among the\nangels\u2014even the Archangels can\u2019t produce it.\u201d\nHe tucked in his wings. \u201cYeah?\u201d\nA shrug. \u201cSo why is Isaiah the Commander of the 33rd?\u201d\nHe took the knife from her and set it in his bag. \u201cBecause I piss off too\nmany people and don\u2019t give a shit that I do.\u201d It had been that way even\nbefore Mount Hermon. Yet Shahar had seen it as a strength. Made him her\ngeneral. He\u2019d tried and failed to live up to that honor.\nBryce gave him a conspirator\u2019s smile. \u201cWe have something in common\nafter all, Athalar.\u201d\nFine. The angel wasn\u2019t so bad. He had patched her up after the bombing\nwith no male swaggering. And he had one Hel of a reason to want this case\nsolved. And he pissed Ruhn off to no end.\nAs he\u2019d finished packing, he\u2019d gotten a call from Isaiah, who said that\ntheir request to see Briggs had been approved\u2014but that it would take a few\ndays to get Briggs cleaned up and brought over from Adrestia Prison. Bryce\nhad chosen to ignore what, exactly, that implied about Briggs\u2019s current\nstate.\nThe only bright spot was that Isaiah informed Hunt that the Oracle had\nmade room for him on her schedule first thing tomorrow.\nBryce eyed Hunt as they boarded the elevator once again, her stomach\nflipping as they plunged toward the central lobby of the Comitium.\nWhatever clearance Hunt had, it somehow included overriding the elevator\ncommands to stop at other floors. Sweet.\nShe\u2019d never really known any of the malakim beyond seeing the\nlegionaries on patrol, or their rich elite strutting like peacocks around town.\nMost preferred the rooftop lounges in the CBD. And since half-breed sluts\nweren\u2019t allowed into those, she\u2019d never had a chance to take one home.\nWell, now she was taking one home, though not in the way she\u2019d once\nimagined while ogling their muscles. She and Danika had once spent two\nsolid summer weeks of lunch breaks sitting on a rooftop adjacent to a legion\ntraining space. With the heat, the male angels had stripped down to their\npants while they sparred. And then got sweaty. Very, very sweaty.\nShe and Danika would have kept going every lunch hour if they hadn\u2019t\nbeen caught by the building\u2019s janitor, who called them perverts and\npermanently locked access to the roof.\nThe elevator slowed to a stop, setting her stomach flipping again. The\ndoors opened, and they were greeted by a wall of impatient-looking\nlegionaries\u2014who all made sure to rearrange their expressions to carefully\nnoncommittal when they beheld Hunt.\nThe Shadow of Death. She\u2019d spied the infamous helmet in his room,\nsitting beside his desk. He\u2019d left it behind, thank the gods.\nThe Comitium lobby beyond the elevators was packed. Full of wings\nand halos and those enticing muscled bodies, all facing the front doors,\ncraning their necks to see over each other but none launching into the\natrium airspace\u2014\nHunt went rigid at the edge of the crowd that had nearly blocked off\nthe barracks elevator bank. Bryce made it all of one step toward him before\nthe elevator to their right opened and Isaiah rushed out, halting as he spied\nHunt. \u201cI just heard\u2014\u201d\nThe ripple of power at the other end of the lobby made her legs buckle.\nAs if that power had knocked the crowd to the ground, everyone knelt\nand bowed their heads.\nLeaving the three of them with a perfect view of the Archangel who\nstood at the giant glass doors of the atrium, Micah at her side."}, "31": {"Name": "PART II THE TRENCH-Chapter 31", "Page Content": " 1 \nSandriel turned toward Hunt, Bryce, and Isaiah at the same moment Micah\ndid. Recognition flared in the dark-haired female\u2019s eyes as that gaze landed\non Hunt, skipped Bryce entirely, and took in Isaiah.\nBryce recognized her, of course. She was on television often enough\nthat no one on the planet wouldn\u2019t recognize her.\nA step ahead, Hunt was a trembling live wire. She\u2019d never seen him\nlike this.\n\u201cGet down,\u201d Isaiah murmured, and knelt.\nHunt didn\u2019t move. Wouldn\u2019t, Bryce realized.

Some of the tension went out of Hunt, but he remained\nstanding.\nHe looked lost, stranded, somewhere between rage and terror. Not\neven a flicker of lightning at his fingertips. Bryce stepped closer to his side,\nflicking her ponytail over a shoulder. She took her brand-new phone out of\nher pocket, making sure the sound was cranked up.\nSo everyone could hear the loud click click click as she snapped photos\nof the two Archangels, then turned, angling herself and the phone, to get a\nshot with herself and the Governors in the background\u2014\nPeople murmured in shock. Bryce tilted her head to the side, smiling\nwide, and snapped another.\nThen she turned to Hunt, who was still trembling, and said as\nflippantly as she could muster, \u201cThanks for bringing me to see them. Shall\nwe?\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t give Hunt the chance to do anything as she looped her arm\nthrough his, turned them both around before taking a photo with him and\nthe stone-faced Archangels and the gawking crowd in the background, and\nthen tugged him back toward the elevator bank.\nThat\u2019s why some legionaries had been rushing to get on. To flee.\nMaybe there was another exit beyond the wall of glass doors. The\ncrowd rose to their feet.\nShe pushed the button, praying it gave her access to any of the tower\u2019s\nfloors. Hunt was still shaking. Bryce gripped his arm tight, tapping her foot\non the tiles as\u2014\n\u201cExplain yourself.\u201d Micah stood behind them, blocking the crowd\nfrom the elevator bank.\nHunt closed his eyes.\nBryce swallowed and turned, nearly whipping Hunt in the face with\nher hair again. \u201cWell, I heard that you had a special guest, so I asked Hunt\nto bring me so I could get a photo\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDo not lie.\u201d\nHunt opened his eyes, then slowly turned to the Governor. \u201cI had to\npick up supplies and clothes. Isaiah gave me the go-ahead to bring her\nhere.\u201d\nAs if speaking his name had summoned him, the Commander of the\n33rd pushed through the line of guards. Isaiah said, \u201cIt\u2019s true, Your Grace.\nHunt was grabbing necessities, and didn\u2019t want to risk leaving Miss Quinlan\nalone while he did it.\u201d\nThe Archangel looked at Isaiah, then Hunt. Then her.\nMicah\u2019s gaze roved over her body. Her face. She knew that gaze, that\nslow study.\nToo fucking bad that Micah was about as warm as a fish at the bottom\nof a mountain lake.\nToo fucking bad he\u2019d used Hunt like a weapon, dangling his freedom\nlike a dog treat.\nToo fucking bad he often worked with her father on city matters, and\non House business\u2014too bad he reminded her of her father.\nBoo. Fucking. Hoo.\nShe said to Micah, \u201cIt was nice to see you again, Your Grace.\u201d Then\nthe elevator doors opened, as if some god had willed them to make a good\nexit.\nShe nudged Hunt inside, and was following him in when a cold, strong\nhand gripped her elbow. She batted her eyelashes up at Micah as he stopped\nher between the elevator doors. Hunt didn\u2019t seem to be breathing.\nAs if he were waiting for the Governor to rescind his deal.\nBut Micah purred, \u201cI would like to take you to dinner, Bryce Quinlan.\u201d\nShe pulled out of his grip, joining Hunt in the elevator. And as the\ndoors closed, she looked the Archangel of Valbara full in the face. \u201cNot\ninterested,\u201d she said.\nHunt had known Sandriel was coming, but running into her today \u2026 She\nmust have wanted to surprise them all, if Isaiah hadn\u2019t known. Wanted to\ncatch the Governor and the legion off guard and see what this place was like\nbefore the pomp and circumstance made their defenses seem stronger, their\nwealth deeper. Before Micah could call in one of his other legions to make\nthem look that much more impressive.\nWhat piss-poor fucking luck that they\u2019d run into her.\nBut at least Pollux hadn\u2019t been there. Not yet.\nThe elevator shot up again, and Bryce stayed silent. Holding herself.\nNot interested.\nHe doubted Micah Domitus had ever heard those words before.\nHe doubted Sandriel ever had someone snap photos of her like that.\nAll he\u2019d been able to think about while he beheld Sandriel was the\nweight of his knife at his side. All he could smell was the reek of her arena,\nblood and shit and piss and sand\u2014\nThen Bryce had made her move. Played that irreverent, vapid party\ngirl she wanted them to believe she was, that he\u2019d believed she was,\nsnapping those photos, giving him an out\u2014\nHunt placed his hand against the disk beside the button panel and\npunched in a different floor, overriding wherever the elevator had been\ntaking them. \u201cWe can leave from the landing.\u201d His voice was like gravel.\nHe always forgot\u2014just how similar Sandriel and Shahar looked. Not\nidentical twins, but their coloring and build had been nearly the same. \u201cI\u2019ll\nhave to carry you, though.\u201d\nShe twirled the silken length of her ponytail around a wrist, unaware\nthat she bared the golden column of her throat to him with the movement.\nNot interested.\nShe\u2019d sounded certain. Not gleeful, not gloating, but \u2026 firm.\nHunt didn\u2019t dare consider how this rejection might affect his bargain\nwith Micah\u2014to wonder if Micah would somehow blame Hunt for it.\nBryce asked, \u201cNo back door?\u201d\n\u201cThere is, but we\u2019d have to go down again.\u201d\nHe could feel her questions bubbling up, and before she could ask any\nof them he said, \u201cSandriel\u2019s Second, Pollux, is even worse than she is.\nWhen he arrives, avoid him at all costs.\u201d\nHe couldn\u2019t bring himself to dredge up the list of horrors Pollux had\ninflicted on innocents.\nBryce clicked her tongue. \u201cLike my path will ever cross theirs if I can\nhelp it.\u201d\nAfter that show in the lobby, it might. But Hunt didn\u2019t tell her that\nSandriel wasn\u2019t above petty revenge for slights and minor offenses. Didn\u2019t\ntell her that Sandriel would likely never forget Bryce\u2019s face. Might already\nbe asking Micah who she was.\nThe doors opened onto a quiet upper level. The halls were dim,\nhushed, and he led her into a labyrinth of gym equipment. A broad path cut\nthrough the gear directly to the wall of windows\u2014and the launch balcony\nbeyond. There was no railing, just an open jut of stone. She balked.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never dropped anyone,\u201d he promised.\nShe gingerly followed him outside. The dry wind whipped at them. Far\nbelow, the city street was packed with onlookers and news vans. Above\nthem, angels were flying, some fleeing outright, some circling the five\nspires of the Comitium to get a glimpse of Sandriel from afar.\nHunt bent, sliding a hand under Bryce\u2019s knees, bracing another on her\nback, and picked her up. Her scent filled his senses, washing away the last\nof the memory of that reeking dungeon.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d he said, meeting her stare. \u201cFor bailing me out back\nthere.\u201d\nShe shrugged as best she could in his grip, but winced as he stepped\ncloser to the edge.\n\u201cThat was fast thinking,\u201d he went on. \u201cRidiculous on so many levels,\nbut I owe you.\u201d\nShe slid her arms around his neck, her grip near-strangling. \u201cYou\nhelped me out last night. We\u2019re even.\u201d\nHunt didn\u2019t give her a chance to change her mind as he beat his wings\nin a powerful push and leapt off the edge. She clung to him, tight enough to\nhurt, and he held her firmly, the duffel strapped across his chest awkwardly\nbanging against his thigh.\n\u201cAre you even watching?\u201d he asked over the wind as he sent them\nsailing hard and fast, flying up, up, up the side of the adjacent skyscraper in\nthe Central Business District.\n\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d she said in his ear.\nHe chuckled as they leveled out, cruising above the reaching pinnacles\nof the CBD, the Istros a winding sparkle to their right, the mist-shrouded\nisle of the Bone Quarter looming behind it. To the left, he could just make\nout the walls of the city, and then the wide-open land beyond the Angels\u2019\nGate. No houses or buildings or roads out there. Nothing but the aerialport.\nBut at the Gate to their right\u2014the Merchants\u2019 Gate in the Meat Market\u2014the\nbroad, pale line of the Western Road shot into the rolling, cypress-dotted\nhills.\nA pleasant, beautiful city\u2014in the midst of pleasant, beautiful\ncountryside.\nIn Pangera, the cities were little more than pens for the Vanir to trap\nand feed on the humans\u2014and their children. No wonder the humans had\nrisen up. No wonder they were shredding that territory with their chemical\nbombs and machines.\nA shiver of rage ran down his spine at the thought of those children,\nand he made himself look toward the city again. The Central Business\nDistrict was separated from the Old Square by the clear dividing line of\nWard Avenue. The sunlight glowed off the white stones of Luna\u2019s Temple\u2014\nand, as if in a mirror reflection directly across from it, seemed to be\nabsorbed by the black-domed Oracle\u2019s Temple. His destination tomorrow\nmorning.\nBut Hunt looked beyond the Old Square, to where the green of Five\nRoses sparkled in the muggy haze. Towering cypresses and palms rose up,\nalong with glittering bursts of magic. In Moonwood, more oak trees\u2014less\nmagic frills. Hunt didn\u2019t bother looking anywhere else. Asphodel Meadows\nwasn\u2019t much to behold. Yet the Meadows was a luxury development\ncompared to the human districts in Pangera.\n\u201cWhy\u2019d you want to live in the Old Square?\u201d he asked after several\nminutes of flying in silence, with only the song of the wind to listen to.\nShe still wasn\u2019t looking, and he began a gentle descent toward her little\nsection of the Old Square, just a block off the river and a few blocks from\nthe Heart Gate. Even from that distance, he could see it, the clear quartz\nglinting like an icy spear toward the gray sky.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the heart of the city,\u201d she said, \u201cwhy not be there?\u201d\n\u201cFiRo is cleaner.\u201d\n\u201cAnd full of Fae peacocks who sneer at half-breeds.\u201d She spat out the\nterm.\n\u201cMoonwood?\u201d\n\u201cSabine\u2019s territory?\u201d A harsh laugh, and she pulled back to look at him.\nHer smattering of freckles crinkled as she scrunched her face. \u201cHonestly,\nthe Old Square is about the only safe place for someone like me. Plus, it\u2019s\nclose to work and I\u2019ve got my pick of restaurants, music halls, and\nmuseums. I never need to leave.\u201d\n\u201cBut you do\u2014you go all over the city on your morning runs. Why a\ndifferent route so often?\u201d\n\u201cKeeps it fresh and fun.\u201d\nHer building became clearer, the roof empty. A firepit, some lounge\nchairs, and a grill occupied most of it. Hunt banked, circling back, and\nsmoothly landed, carefully setting her down. She clung to him long enough\nto get her legs steady, then stepped back.\nHe adjusted the duffel, heading for the roof door. He held it open for\nher, firstlight warming the stairwell beyond. \u201cDid you mean what you said\n\u2014to Micah?\u201d\nShe plunked down the stairs, the ponytail bobbing. \u201cOf course I did.\nWhy the Hel would I want to go out with him?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s the Governor of Valbara.\u201d\n\u201cSo? Just because I saved his life, that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m destined to be\nhis girlfriend. It\u2019d be like banging a statue anyway.\u201d\nHunt smirked. \u201cIn all fairness, the females who have been with him\nsay otherwise.\u201d\nShe unlocked her door, mouth twisting. \u201cLike I said, not interested.\u201d\n\u201cYou sure it\u2019s not because you\u2019re just avoiding\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSee, that right there is the problem. You and the whole rest of the\nworld seem to think I exist just to find someone like him. That of course I\ncan\u2019t be genuinely not interested, because why wouldn\u2019t I want a big, strong\nmale to protect me? Surely if I\u2019m pretty and single, the second any\npowerful Vanir shows interest, I\u2019m bound to drop my panties. In fact, I\ndidn\u2019t even have a life until he showed up\u2014never had good sex, never felt\nalive\u2014\u201d\nDarkest Hel, this woman. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a real chip on your shoulder\nthere, you know.\u201d\nBryce snickered. \u201cYou make it really fucking easy, you know.\u201d\nHunt crossed his arms. She crossed hers.\nThat stupid fucking ponytail seemed to cross its proverbial arms, too.\n\u201cSo,\u201d Hunt said through his teeth as he dumped his duffel on the\nground, clothes and weapons thumping hard. \u201cYou gonna come with me to\nthe Oracle tomorrow or what?\u201d\n\u201cOh no, Athalar.\u201d Her purred words ran over his skin, and her smile\nwas pure wickedness. Hunt braced himself for whatever was about to come\nout of her mouth. Even as he found himself looking forward to it. \u201cYou get\nto deal with her alone.\u201d"}, "32": {"Name": "PART II THE TRENCH-Chapter 32", "Page Content": " 2 \nAfter dropping off his gear at the apartment, Hunt trailed Bryce back to\nwork, where she said she intended to look through Danika\u2019s location data\nfrom Declan and cross-reference it with her own list\u2014and the murder\nscenes so far.\nBut the thought of sitting underground for another few hours grated\nenough that he found himself sitting on the roof instead. He needed the\nfresh, open air. Even if angels were still flying past\u2014leaving the city. He\nmade a point not to look toward the Comitium, looming at his back.\nJust before sundown, Syrinx in tow, Bryce emerged from the gallery\nwith a grim expression that matched Hunt\u2019s own.\n\u201cNothing?\u201d he asked, landing on the sidewalk beside her.\n\u201cNothing,\u201d she confirmed.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll look tomorrow with fresh eyes.\u201d Maybe there was something\nthey were missing. Today had been long and awful and weird, and he was\nmore than ready to collapse on her couch.\nHe asked as casually as he could, \u201cThere\u2019s a big sunball game on\ntonight. You mind if I watch it?\u201d\nShe glanced at him sidelong, her brows rising.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked, unable to keep the corner of his mouth from\ntwitching upward.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just \u2026 you\u2019re such \u2026 a guy .\u201d She waved a hand at him. \u201cWith\nthe sports and stuff.\u201d\n\u201cFemales like sports as much as males.\u201d\nShe rolled her eyes. \u201cThis sunball-watching person doesn\u2019t fit with my\nmental image of the Shadow of Death.\u201d\n\u201cSorry to disappoint.\u201d Hunt\u2019s turn to lift a brow. \u201cWhat do  you think I\ndo with my spare time?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I assumed you cursed at the stars and brooded and\nplotted revenge on all your enemies.\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t know the half of it. But Hunt let out a low chuckle. \u201cAgain,\nsorry to disappoint.\u201d\nHer eyes crinkled with amusement, the last of the day\u2019s sun lighting\nthem into liquid gold. He forced himself to monitor the streets around them.\nThey were a block from Bryce\u2019s apartment when Hunt\u2019s phone rang.\nShe tensed, peering at his screen the same moment he did.\nThe phone rang a second time. They both stared at the name that\npopped up, pedestrians streaming past.\n\u201cYou gonna answer it?\u201d Bryce asked quietly.\nIt rang a third time.\nHunt knew. Before he hit the button, he knew.\nWhich was why he stepped away from Quinlan, putting the phone to\nhis ear just as he said blandly, \u201cHi, boss.\u201d\n\u201cI have work for you tonight,\u201d Micah said.\nHunt\u2019s gut twisted. \u201cSure.\u201d\n\u201cI hope I\u2019m not interrupting your fun with Miss Quinlan.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re good,\u201d Hunt said tightly.\nMicah\u2019s pause was loaded. \u201cWhat occurred in the lobby this morning\nis never to happen again. Understood?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d He bit out the word. But he said it\u2014and meant it\u2014because the\nalternative to Micah was now staying at the Governor\u2019s residence in the\nComitium. Because Sandriel would have drawn out his punishment for\nrefusing to bow, for embarrassing her, for days, weeks. Months.\nBut Micah would give him this warning, and make him do this job\ntonight to remind him where the fuck he stood in the pecking order, and\nthen that would be that.\n\u201cGood,\u201d Micah said. \u201cThe file\u2019s waiting at your room in the barracks.\u201d\nHe paused, as if sensing the question now burning through Hunt. \u201cThe offer\nstill stands, Athalar. Don\u2019t make me reconsider.\u201d The call ended.\nHunt clenched his jaw hard enough to hurt.\nQuinlan\u2019s forehead wrinkled with concern. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d\nHunt slid the phone into his pocket. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d He resumed walking.\n\u201cJust legion business.\u201d Not a lie. Not entirely.\nThe glass doors to her building opened. Hunt nodded toward the lobby.\n\u201cYou head up. I\u2019ve got something to do. I\u2019ll call if we get the date and time\nfor Briggs.\u201d\nHer amber eyes narrowed. Yeah, she saw right through it. Or rather,\nheard everything he wasn\u2019t saying. Knew what Micah had ordered him to\ndo.\nBut she said, \u201cAll right.\u201d She turned toward the lobby, but added over\nher shoulder, \u201cGood luck.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t bother answering before he shot into the skies, phone already\nto his ear as he called Justinian to ask him to play sentry for a few hours.\nJustinian whined about missing the sunball game, but Hunt pulled rank,\nearning a grumbled promise that the angel would be at the adjacent rooftop\nin ten minutes.\nJustinian arrived in eight. Leaving his brother-in-arms to it, Hunt\nsucked in a breath of dusty, dry air, the Istros a teal ribbon to his left, and\nwent to do what he did best.\n\u201cPlease.\u201d\nIt was always the same word. The only word people tended to say\nwhen the Umbra Mortis stood before them.\nThrough the blood splattered on his helmet, Hunt regarded the male\ncougar shifter cowering before him. His clawed hands shook as he left them\nupraised. \u201cPlease,\u201d the man sobbed.\nEvery utterance dragged Hunt further away. Until the arm he\noutstretched was distant, until the gun he aimed at the male\u2019s head was just\na bit of metal.\nA death for a death.\n\u201cPlease.\u201d\nThe male had done horrible things. Unspeakable things. He deserved\nthis. Deserved worse.\n\u201cPleasepleaseplease.\u201d\nHunt was nothing but a shadow, a wisp of life, an instrument of death.\nHe was nothing and no one at all.\n\u201cPle\u2014\u201d\nHunt\u2019s finger curled on the trigger.\nHunt returned early. Well, early for him.\nThankfully, no one was in the barracks bathroom while he showered\noff the blood. Then sat under the scalding spray for so long that he lost track\nof time.\nHe would have stayed longer had he not known that Justinian was\nwaiting.\nSo he patched himself up, pieced himself together. Half crawled out of\nthe boiling-hot shower and into the person he was when he wasn\u2019t forced to\nput a bullet between someone\u2019s eyes.\nHe made a few stops before getting back to Bryce\u2019s apartment. But he\nmade it back, relieving Justinian from his duties, and walked through\nBryce\u2019s door at eleven.\nShe was in her bedroom, the door shut, but Syrinx let out a little yowl\nof welcome from within. Her scolding hush was proof that she\u2019d heard\nHunt return. Hunt prayed she wouldn\u2019t come into the hall. Words were still\nbeyond him.\nHer doorknob turned. But Hunt was already at his room, and didn\u2019t\ndare look across the expanse of the great room as she said tightly, \u201cYou\u2019re\nback.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he choked out.\nEven across the room, he could feel her questions. But she said softly,\n\u201cI recorded the game for you. If you still want to watch it.\u201d\nSomething tightened unbearably in his chest. But Hunt didn\u2019t look\nback.\nHe slipped into his room with a mumbled \u201cNight,\u201d and shut the door\nbehind him."}, "33": {"Name": "PART II THE TRENCH-Chapter 33", "Page Content": " 3 \nThe Oracle\u2019s black chamber reeked of sulfur and roasted meat\u2014the former\nfrom the natural gases rising from the hole in the center of the space, the\nlatter from the pile of bull bones currently smoldering atop the altar against\nthe far wall, an offering to Ogenas, Keeper of Mysteries.\nAfter last night, what he\u2019d done, a sacred temple was the last place he\nwanted to be. The last place he deserved to be.\nThe twenty-foot doors shut behind Hunt as he strode across the silent\nchamber, aiming for the hole in the center and wall of smoke behind it. His\neyes burned with the various acrid scents, and he summoned a wind to keep\nthem out of his face.\nBehind the smoke, a figure moved. \u201cI wondered when the Shadow of\nDeath would darken my chamber,\u201d a lovely voice said. Young, full of light\nand amusement\u2014and yet tinged with ancient cruelty.\nHunt halted at the edge of the hole, avoiding the urge to peer into the\nendless blackness. \u201cI won\u2019t take much of your time,\u201d he said, his voice\nswallowed by the room, the pit, the smoke.\n\u201cI shall give you what time Ogenas offers.\u201d The smoke parted, and he\nsucked in a breath at the being that emerged.\nSphinxes were rare\u2014only a few dozen walked the earth, and all of\nthem had been called to the service of the gods. No one knew how old they\nwere, and this one before him \u2026 She was so beautiful he forgot what to do\nwith his body. The golden lioness\u2019s form moved with fluid grace, pacing the\nother side of the hole, weaving in and out of the mist. Golden wings lay\nfolded against the slender body, shimmering as if they were crafted from\nmolten metal. And above that winged lion\u2019s body \u2026 the golden-haired\nwoman\u2019s face was as flawless as Shahar\u2019s had been.\nNo one knew her name. She was simply her title: Oracle. He wondered\nif she was so old that she\u2019d forgotten her true name.\nThe sphinx blinked large brown eyes at him, lashes brushing against\nher light brown cheeks. \u201cAsk me your question, and I shall tell you what the\nsmoke whispers to me.\u201d The words rumbled over his bones, luring him in.\nNot in the way he sometimes let himself be lured in by beautiful females,\nbut in the manner that a spider might lure a fly to its web.\nMaybe Quinlan and her cousin had a point about not wanting to come\nhere. Hel, Quinlan had refused to even set foot in the park surrounding the\nblack-stoned temple, opting to wait on a bench at its edge with Ruhn.\n\u201cWhat I say here is confidential, right?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cOnce the gods speak, I become the conduit through which their words\npass.\u201d She arranged herself on the floor before the hole, folding her front\npaws, claws glinting in the dim light of the braziers smoldering to either\nside of them. \u201cBut yes\u2014this shall be confidential.\u201d\nIt sounded like a whole bunch of bullshit, but he blew out a breath,\nmeeting those large brown eyes, and said, \u201cWhy does someone want Luna\u2019s\nHorn?\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t ask who had taken it\u2014he knew from the reports that she had\nalready been asked that question two years ago and had refused to answer.\nShe blinked, wings rustling as if in surprise, but settled herself.\nBreathed in the fumes rising from the hole. Minutes passed, and Hunt\u2019s\nhead began to throb with the various scents\u2014especially the reeking sulfur.\nSmoke swirled, masking the sphinx from sight even though she sat\nonly ten feet away.\nHunt forced himself to keep still.\nA rasping voice slithered out of the smoke. \u201cTo open the doorway\nbetween worlds.\u201d A chill seized Hunt. \u201cThey wish to use the Horn to reopen\nthe Northern Rift. The Horn\u2019s purpose wasn\u2019t merely to close doors\u2014it\nopens them, too. It depends on what the bearer wishes.\u201d\n\u201cBut the Horn is broken.\u201d\n\u201cIt can be healed.\u201d\nHunt\u2019s heart stalled. \u201cHow?\u201d\nA long, long pause. Then, \u201cIt is veiled. I cannot see. None can see.\u201d\n\u201cThe Fae legends say it can\u2019t be repaired.\u201d\n\u201cThose are legends. This is truth. The Horn can be repaired.\u201d\n\u201cWho wants to do this?\u201d He had to ask, even if it was foolish.\n\u201cThis, too, is veiled.\u201d\n\u201cHelpful.\u201d\n\u201cBe grateful, Lord of Lightning, that you learned anything at all.\u201d That\nvoice\u2014that title \u2026 His mouth went dry. \u201cDo you wish to know what I see\nin your future, Orion Athalar?\u201d\nHe recoiled at the sound of his birth name like he\u2019d been punched in\nthe gut. \u201cNo one has spoken that name in two hundred years,\u201d he\nwhispered.\n\u201cThe name your mother gave you.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d he ground out, his gut twisting at the memory of his mother\u2019s\nface, the love that had always shone in her eyes for him. Utterly\nundeserved, that love\u2014especially when he had not been there to protect her.\nThe Oracle whispered, \u201cShall I tell you what I see, Orion?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure I want to know.\u201d\nThe smoke peeled back enough for him to see her sensuous lips part in\na cruel smile that did not wholly belong in this world. \u201cPeople come from\nacross Midgard to plead for my visions, yet you do not wish to know?\u201d\nThe hair on the back of his neck stood. \u201cI thank you, but no.\u201d Thanks\nseemed wise\u2014like something that might appease a god.\nHer teeth shone, her canines long enough to shred flesh. \u201cDid Bryce\nQuinlan tell you what occurred when she stood in this chamber twelve\nyears ago?\u201d\nHis blood turned to ice. \u201cThat\u2019s Quinlan\u2019s business.\u201d\nThat smile didn\u2019t falter. \u201cYou do not wish to know what I saw for her,\neither?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d He spoke from his heart. \u201cIt\u2019s her business,\u201d he repeated. His\nlightning rose within him, rallying against a foe he could not slay.\nThe Oracle blinked, a slow bob of those thick lashes. \u201cYou remind me\nof that which was lost long ago,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI had not realized it\nmight ever appear again.\u201d\nBefore Hunt dared ask what that meant, her lion\u2019s tail\u2014a larger\nversion of Syrinx\u2019s\u2014swayed over the floor. The doors behind him opened\non a phantom wind, his dismissal clear. But the Oracle said before stalking\ninto the vapors, \u201cDo yourself a favor, Orion Athalar: keep well away from\nBryce Quinlan.\u201d"}, "34": {"Name": "PART II THE TRENCH-Chapter 34", "Page Content": " 4 \nBryce and Ruhn had waited at the edge of the Oracle\u2019s Park for Hunt, each\nminute dripping by. And when he\u2019d emerged again, eyes searching every\ninch of her face \u2026 Bryce knew it was bad. Whatever he\u2019d learned.\nHunt waited until they\u2019d walked down a quiet residential block\nbordering the park before he told them what the Oracle had said about the\nHorn.\nHis words were still hanging in the bright morning air around them as\nBryce blew out a breath. Hunt did the same beside her and then said, \u201cIf\nsomeone has learned how to repair the Horn after so long, then they can do\nthe opposite of what Prince Pelias did. They can open the Northern Rift. It\nseems like one Hel of a motive to kill anyone who might rat them out.\u201d\nRuhn ran a hand over the buzzed side of his hair. \u201cLike the acolyte at\nthe temple\u2014either as a warning to us to stay the fuck away from the Horn\nor to keep her from saying anything, if she\u2019d found out somehow.\u201d\nHunt nodded. \u201cIsaiah questioned the others at the temple\u2014they said\nthe girl was the only acolyte on duty the night the Horn was stolen, and was\ninterviewed then, but claimed she didn\u2019t know anything about it.\u201d\nGuilt twisted and writhed within Bryce.\nRuhn said, \u201cMaybe she was scared to say anything. And when we\nshowed up \u2026\u201d\nHunt finished, \u201cWhoever is looking for the Horn doesn\u2019t want us\nanywhere near it. They could have learned she\u2019d been on duty that night\nand gone to extract information from her. They\u2019d have wanted to make sure\nshe didn\u2019t reveal what she knew to anyone else\u2014to make sure she stayed\nsilent. Permanently.\u201d\nBryce added the girl\u2019s death to the list of others she\u2019d repay before this\nwas finished.\nThen she asked, \u201cIf that mark on the crate really was the Horn, maybe\nthe Ophion\u2014or even just the Keres sect\u2014is seeking the Horn to aid in their\nrebellion. To open a portal to Hel, and bring the demon princes back here in\nsome sort of alliance to overthrow the Asteri.\u201d She shuddered. \u201cMillions\nwould die.\u201d At their chilled silence, she went on, \u201cMaybe Danika caught on\nto their plans about the Horn\u2014and was killed for it. And the acolyte, too.\u201d\nHunt rubbed the back of his neck, his face ashen. \u201cThey\u2019d need help\nfrom a Vanir to summon a demon like that, but it\u2019s a possibility. There are\nsome Vanir pledged to their cause. Or maybe one of the witches summoned\nit. The new witch queen could be testing her power, or something.\u201d\n\u201cUnlikely that a witch was involved,\u201d Ruhn said a shade tightly,\npiercings along his ear glinting in the sun. \u201cThe witches obey the Asteri\u2014\nthey\u2019ve had millennia of unbroken loyalty.\u201d\nBryce said, \u201cBut the Horn can only be used by a Starborn Fae\u2014by\nyou, Ruhn.\u201d\nHunt\u2019s wings rustled. \u201cSo maybe they\u2019re looking for some way around\nthe Starborn shit.\u201d\n\u201cHonestly,\u201d Ruhn said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure I could use the Horn. Prince\nPelias possessed what was basically an ocean of starlight at his disposal.\u201d\nHer brother\u2019s brow furrowed, and a pinprick of light appeared at his\nfingertip. \u201cThis is about as good as it gets for me.\u201d\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re not going to use the Horn, even if we find it, so it won\u2019t\nmatter,\u201d Bryce said.\nRuhn crossed his arms. \u201cIf someone can repair the Horn \u2026 I don\u2019t\neven know how that would be possible. I read some mentions of the Horn\nhaving a sort of sentience to it\u2014almost like it was alive. Maybe a healing\npower of some sort would be applicable? A medwitch might have some\ninsight.\u201d\nBryce countered, \u201cThey heal people, not objects. And the book you\nfound in the gallery\u2019s library said the Horn could only be repaired by light\nthat is not light, magic that is not magic.\u201d\n\u201cLegends,\u201d said Hunt. \u201cNot truth.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s worth looking into,\u201d Ruhn said, and halted, glancing between\nBryce and Hunt, who was watching her warily from the corner of his eye.\nWhatever the fuck that meant. Ruhn said, \u201cI\u2019ll look up a few medwitches\nand pay some discreet visits.\u201d\n\u201cFine,\u201d she said. When he stiffened, she amended, \u201cThat sounds\ngood.\u201d\nEven if nothing else about this case did.\nBryce tuned out the sound of Lehabah watching one of her dramas and tried\nto concentrate on the map of Danika\u2019s locations. Tried but failed, since she\ncould feel Hunt\u2019s eyes lingering on her from across the library table. For the\nhundredth time in that hour alone. She met his stare, and he looked away\nquickly. \u201cWhat?\u201d\nHe shook his head and went back to his research.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been staring at me all afternoon with that weird fucking look\non your face.\u201d\nHe drummed his fingers on the table, then blurted, \u201cYou want to tell\nme why the Oracle warned me to stay the Hel away from you?\u201d\nBryce let out a short laugh. \u201cIs that why you seemed all freaked when\nyou left the temple?\u201d\n\u201cShe said she\u2019d reveal her vision for you\u2014like she has a damned bone\nto pick with you.\u201d\nA shiver crawled down Bryce\u2019s spine at that. \u201cI don\u2019t blame her if\nshe\u2019s still pissed.\u201d\nHunt paled, but Bryce said, \u201cIn Fae culture, there\u2019s a custom: when\ngirls get their cycle for the first time, or when they turn thirteen, they go to\nan Oracle. The visit provides a glimpse toward what sort of power they\nmight ascend to when mature, so their parents can plan unions years before\nthe actual Drop. Boys go, too\u2014at age thirteen. These days, if the parents\nare progressive, it\u2019s just an old tradition to figure out a career for their\nchildren. Soldiers or healers or whatever Fae do if they can\u2019t afford to\nlounge around eating grapes all day.\u201d\n\u201cThe Fae and malakim might hate each other, but they have a lot of\nbullshit in common.\u201d\nBryce hummed her agreement. \u201cMy cycle started when I was a few\nweeks shy of thirteen. And my mom had this \u2026 I don\u2019t know. Crisis? This\nsudden fear that she\u2019d shut me off from a part of my heritage. She got in\ntouch with my biological father. Two weeks later, the documents showed\nup, declaring me a full civitas. It came with a catch, though: I had to claim\nSky and Breath as my House. I refused, but my mom actually insisted I do\nit. She saw it as some kind of \u2026 protection. I don\u2019t know. Apparently, she\nwas convinced enough of his intention to protect me that she asked if he\nwanted to meet me. For the first time. And I eventually cooled down\nenough from the whole House allegiance thing to realize I wanted to meet\nhim, too.\u201d\nHunt read her beat of silence. \u201cIt didn\u2019t go well.\u201d\n\u201cNo. That visit was the first time I met Ruhn, too. I came here\u2014stayed\nin FiRo for the summer. I met the Autumn King.\u201d The lie was easy. \u201cMet\nmy father, too,\u201d she added. \u201cIn the initial few days, the visit wasn\u2019t as bad\nas my mother had feared. I liked what I saw. Even if some of the other Fae\nchildren whispered that I was a half-breed, I knew what I was. I\u2019ve never\nnot been proud of it\u2014being human, I mean. And I knew my father had\ninvited me, so he at least wanted me there. I didn\u2019t mind what others\nthought. Until the Oracle.\u201d\nHe winced. \u201cI have a bad feeling about this.\u201d\n\u201cIt was catastrophic.\u201d She swallowed against the memory. \u201cWhen the\nOracle looked into her smoke, she screamed. Clawed at her eyes.\u201d There\nwas no point hiding it. The event had been known in some circles. \u201cI heard\nlater that she went blind for a week.\u201d\n\u201cHoly shit.\u201d\nBryce laughed to herself. \u201cApparently, my future is that bad.\u201d\nHunt didn\u2019t smile. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n\u201cI returned to the petitioners\u2019 antechamber. All you could hear was the\nOracle screaming and cursing me\u2014the acolytes rushed in.\u201d\n\u201cI meant with your father.\u201d\n\u201cHe called me a worthless disgrace, stormed out of the temple\u2019s VIP\nexit so no one could know who he was to me, and by the time I caught up,\nhe\u2019d taken the car and left. When I got back to his house, I found my bags\non the curb.\u201d\n\u201cAsshole. Danaan had nothing to say about him kicking his cousin to\nthe curb?\u201d\n\u201cThe king forbade Ruhn to interfere.\u201d She examined her nails.\n\u201cBelieve me, Ruhn tried to fight. But the king bound him. So I got a cab to\nthe train station. Ruhn managed to shove money for the fares into my\nhand.\u201d\n\u201cYour mom must have gone ballistic.\u201d\n\u201cShe did.\u201d Bryce paused a moment and then said, \u201cSeems like the\nOracle\u2019s still pissed.\u201d\nHe threw her a half smile. \u201cI\u2019d consider it a badge of honor.\u201d\nBryce, despite herself, smiled back. \u201cYou\u2019re probably the only one\nwho thinks that.\u201d His eyes lingered on her face again, and she knew it had\nnothing to do with what the Oracle had said.\nBryce cleared her throat. \u201cFind anything?\u201d\nCatching her request to drop the subject, Hunt pivoted the laptop\ntoward her. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking at this ancient shit for days\u2014and this is all\nI\u2019ve found.\u201d\nThe terra-cotta vase dated back nearly fifteen thousand years. After\nPrince Pelias by about a century, but the kristallos hadn\u2019t yet faded from\ncommon memory. She read the brief catalog copy and said, \u201cIt\u2019s at a gallery\nin Mirsia.\u201d Which put it a sea and two thousand miles beyond that from\nLunathion. She pulled the computer to her and clicked on the thumbnail.\n\u201cBut these photos should be enough.\u201d\n\u201cI might have been born before computers, Quinlan, but I do know\nhow to use them.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just trying to spare you from further ruining your badass image as\nthe Umbra Mortis. We can\u2019t have word getting out that you\u2019re a computer\nnerd.\u201d\n\u201cThanks for your concern.\u201d His eyes met hers, the corner of his mouth\nkicking up.\nHer toes might have curled in her heels. Slightly.\nBryce straightened. \u201cAll right. Tell me what I\u2019m looking at.\u201d\n\u201cA good sign.\u201d Hunt pointed at the image, rendered in black paint\nagainst the burnt orange of the terra-cotta, of the kristallos demon roaring as\na sword was driven through its head by a helmeted male warrior.\nShe leaned toward the screen. \u201cHow so?\u201d\n\u201cThat the kristallos can be killed the old-fashioned way. As far as I can\ntell, there\u2019s no magic or special artifact being used to kill it here. Just plain\nbrute force.\u201d\nHer gut tightened. \u201cThis vase could be an artistic interpretation. That\nthing killed Danika and the Pack of Devils, and knocked Micah on his ass,\ntoo. And you mean to tell me some ancient warrior killed it with just a\nsword through the head?\u201d\nThough Lehabah\u2019s show kept playing, Bryce knew the sprite was\nlistening to every word.\nHunt said, \u201cMaybe the kristallos had the element of surprise on its side\nthat night.\u201d\nShe tried and failed to block out the red pulped piles, the spray of\nblood on the walls, the way her entire body had seemed to plummet\ndownward even while standing still as she stared at what was left of her\nfriends. \u201cOr maybe this is just a bullshit rendering by an artist who heard an\nembellished song around a fire and did their own take on it.\u201d She began\ntapping her foot under the table, as if it\u2019d somehow calm her staccato\nheartbeat.\nHe held her stare, his black eyes stark and honest. \u201cAll right.\u201d She\nwaited for him to push, to pry, but Hunt slid the computer back to his side\nof the table. He squinted. \u201cThat\u2019s odd. It says the vase is originally from\nParthos.\u201d He angled his head. \u201cI thought Parthos was a myth. A human fairy\ntale.\u201d\n\u201cBecause humans were no better than rock-banging animals until the\nAsteri arrived?\u201d\n\u201cTell me you don\u2019t believe that conspiracy crap about an ancient\nlibrary in the heart of a pre-existing human civilization?\u201d When she didn\u2019t\nanswer, Hunt challenged, \u201cIf something like that did exist, where\u2019s the\nevidence?\u201d\nBryce zipped her amulet along its chain and nodded toward the image\non the screen.\n\u201cThis vase was made by a nymph,\u201d he said. \u201cNot some mythical,\nenlightened human.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe Parthos hadn\u2019t been wiped off the map entirely at that point.\u201d\nHunt looked at her from under lowered brows. \u201cReally, Quinlan?\u201d\nWhen she again didn\u2019t answer, he jerked his chin at her digital tablet.\n\u201cWhere are you with the data about Danika\u2019s locations?\u201d\nHunt\u2019s phone buzzed before she could reply, but Bryce said, reeling\nherself back together as that image of the slain kristallos bled with what had\nbeen done to Danika, what had been left of her, \u201cI\u2019m still ruling out the\nthings that were likely unconnected, but \u2026 Really, the only outlier here is\nthe fact that Danika was on sentry duty at Luna\u2019s Temple. She was\nsometimes stationed in the general area, but never specifically at the temple\nitself. And somehow, days before she died, she got put on watch there? And\ndata shows her being right there when the Horn was stolen. The acolyte was\nalso there that night. It\u2019s all got to tie together somehow.\u201d\nHunt set down his phone. \u201cMaybe Philip Briggs will enlighten us\ntonight.\u201d\nHer head snapped up. \u201cTonight?\u201d\nLehabah completely stopped watching her show at that.\n\u201cJust got the message from Viktoria. They transferred him from\nAdrestia. We\u2019re meeting him in an hour in a holding cell under the\nComitium.\u201d He surveyed the data spread before them. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be\ndifficult.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d\nHe leaned back in the chair. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to have nice things to say\nabout Danika. You sure you can handle hearing his kind of venom?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\n\u201cReally? Because that vase just set you off, and I doubt coming face-\nto-face with this guy is going to be any easier.\u201d\nThe walls began swelling around her. \u201cGet out.\u201d Her words cut\nbetween them. \u201cJust because we\u2019re working together doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re\nentitled to push into my personal matters.\u201d\nHunt merely looked her over. Saw all of that. But he said roughly, \u201cI\nwant to head to the Comitium in twenty. I\u2019ll wait for you outside.\u201d\nBryce trailed Hunt out, making sure he didn\u2019t touch any of the books\nand that they didn\u2019t grab for him, then shut the door before he\u2019d fully\nwalked onto the street beyond.\nShe sank against the iron until she sat on the carpet, and braced her\nforearms on her knees.\nThey were gone\u2014all of them. Thanks to that demon depicted on an\nancient vase. They were gone, and there would be no more wolves in her\nlife. No more hanging out in the apartment. No more drunken, stupid\ndancing on street corners, or blasting music at three in the morning until\ntheir neighbors threatened to call the 33rd.\nNo friends who would say I love you and mean it. Syrinx and Lele\ncame creeping in, the chimera curling up beneath her bent legs, the sprite\nlying belly-down on Bryce\u2019s forearm.\n\u201cDon\u2019t blame Athie. I think he wants to be our friend.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit what Hunt Athalar wants.\u201d\n\u201cJune is busy with ballet, and Fury is as good as gone. Maybe it\u2019s time\nfor more friends, BB. You seem sad again. Like you were two winters ago.\nFine one minute, then not fine the next. You don\u2019t dance, you don\u2019t hang\nout with anyone, you don\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\u201cLeave it, Lehabah.\u201d\n\u201cHunt is nice. And Prince Ruhn is nice. But Danika was never nice to\nme. Always biting and snarling. Or she ignored me.\u201d\n\u201cWatch it.\u201d\nThe sprite crawled off her arm and floated in front of her, arms\nwrapping across her round belly. \u201cYou can be cold as a Reaper, Bryce.\u201d\nThen she was gone, whizzing off to stop a thick leather-bound tome from\ncrawling its way up the stairs.\nBryce blew out a long breath, trying to piece the hole in her chest\ntogether.\nTwenty minutes, Hunt had said. She had twenty minutes before going\nto question Briggs. Twenty minutes to get her shit together. Or at least\npretend she had."}, "35": {"Name": "PART II THE TRENCH-Chapter 35", "Page Content": " 5 \nThe fluorescent wands of firstlight hummed through the white-paneled,\npristine corridor far beneath the Comitium. Hunt was a storm of black and\ngray against the shining white tiles, his steps unfaltering as he aimed for\none of the sealed metal doors at the end of the long hall.\nA step behind him, Bryce simply watched Hunt move\u2014the way he cut\nthrough the world, the way the guards in the entry room hadn\u2019t so much as\nchecked his ID before waving them through.\nShe hadn\u2019t realized that this place existed beneath the five shining\ntowers of the Comitium. That they had cells. Interrogation rooms.\nThe one she\u2019d been in the night Danika had died had been five blocks\nfrom here. A facility governed by protocols. But this place \u2026 She tried not\nto think about what this place was for. What laws stopped applying once\none crossed over the threshold.\nThe lack of any scent except bleach suggested it was scrubbed down\noften. The drains she noted every few feet suggested\u2014\nShe didn\u2019t want to know what the drains suggested.\nThey reached a room without windows, and Hunt laid a palm against\nthe circular metal lock to its left. A hum and hiss, and he shouldered open\nthe door, peering inside before nodding to her.\nThe firstlights above droned like hornets. What would her own\nfirstlight go toward, small mote that it would be? With Hunt, the explosion\nof energy-filled light that had probably erupted from him when he\u2019d made\nthe Drop had likely gone toward fueling an entire city.\nShe sometimes wondered about it: whose firstlight was powering her\nphone, or the stereo, or her coffee machine.\nAnd now was not the time to think about random shit, she chided\nherself as she followed Hunt into the cell and beheld the pale-skinned man\nsitting there.\nTwo seats had been set before the metal table in the center of the room\n\u2014where Briggs\u2019s shackles were currently chained. His white jumpsuit was\npristine, but\u2014\nBryce beheld the state of his gaunt, hollow face and willed herself not\nto flinch. His dark hair was buzzed close to his scalp, and though not a\nbruise or scratch marred his skin, his deep blue eyes \u2026 empty and hopeless.\nBriggs said nothing as she and Hunt claimed the seats across the table.\nCameras blinked red lights in every corner, and she had no doubt someone\nwas listening in a control room a few doors down.\n\u201cWe won\u2019t take much of your time,\u201d Hunt said, as if noting those\nhaunted eyes as well.\n\u201cTime is all I have now, angel. And being here is better than being \u2026\nthere.\u201d\nThere, where they kept him in Adrestia Prison. Where they did the\nthings to him that resulted in those broken, awful eyes.\nBryce could feel Hunt silently urging her to ask the first of their\nquestions, and she took a breath, bracing herself to fill this humming, too-\nsmall room with her voice.\nBut Briggs asked, \u201cWhat month is it? What\u2019s today\u2019s date?\u201d\nHorror coiled in her gut. This man had wanted to kill people, she\nreminded herself. Even if it seemed he hadn\u2019t killed Danika, he had planned\nto kill plenty of others, to ignite a larger-scale war between the human and\nVanir. To overthrow the Asteri. It was why he remained behind bars.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the twelfth of April,\u201d Hunt said, his voice low, \u201cin the year\n15035.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s only been two years?\u201d\nBryce swallowed against the dryness in her mouth. \u201cWe came to ask\nyou about some things related to two years ago. As well as some recent\nevents.\u201d\nBriggs looked at her then. Really looked. \u201cWhy?\u201d\nHunt leaned back, a silent indication that this was now her show to\nrun. \u201cThe White Raven nightclub was bombed a few days ago. Considering\nthat it was one of your prime targets a few years ago, evidence points\ntoward Keres being active again.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you think I\u2019m behind it?\u201d A bitter smile curved the angular,\nharsh face. Hunt tensed. \u201cI don\u2019t know what year it is, girl. And you think\nI\u2019m somehow able to make outside contact?\u201d\n\u201cWhat about your followers?\u201d Hunt said carefully. \u201cWould they have\ndone it in your name?\u201d\n\u201cWhy bother?\u201d Briggs reclined in his chair. \u201cI failed them. I failed our\npeople.\u201d He nodded toward Bryce. \u201cAnd failed people like you\u2014the\nundesirables.\u201d\n\u201cYou never represented me,\u201d Bryce said quietly. \u201cI abhor what you\ntried to do.\u201d\nBriggs laughed, a broken rasp. \u201cWhen the Vanir tell you you\u2019re not\ngood enough for any job because of your human blood, when males like\nthis asshole next to you just see you as a piece of ass to be fucked and then\ndiscarded, when you see your mother\u2014it is a human mother for you, isn\u2019t\nit? It always is\u2014being treated like trash \u2026 You\u2019ll find those self-righteous\nfeelings fading real fast.\u201d\nShe refused to reply. To think about the times she\u2019d seen her mother\nignored or sneered at\u2014\nHunt said, \u201cSo you\u2019re saying you\u2019re not behind this bombing.\u201d\n\u201cAgain,\u201d Briggs said, tugging on his shackles, \u201cthe only people I see\non a daily basis are the ones who take me apart like a cadaver, and then\nstitch me up again before nightfall, their medwitches smoothing everything\naway.\u201d\nHer stomach churned. Even Hunt\u2019s throat bobbed as he swallowed.\n\u201cYour followers wouldn\u2019t have considered bombing the nightclub in\nrevenge?\u201d\nBriggs demanded, \u201cAgainst who?\u201d\n\u201cUs. For investigating Danika Fendyr\u2019s murder and looking for Luna\u2019s\nHorn.\u201d\nBriggs\u2019s blue eyes shuttered. \u201cSo the assholes in the 33rd finally\nrealized I didn\u2019t kill her.\u201d\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t been officially cleared of anything,\u201d Hunt said roughly.\nBriggs shook his head, staring at the wall to his left. \u201cI don\u2019t know\nanything about Luna\u2019s Horn, and I\u2019m sure as shit no Keres soldier did\neither, but I liked Danika Fendyr. Even when she busted me, I liked her.\u201d\nHunt stared at the gaunt, haunted man\u2014a shell of the powerfully built adult\nhe\u2019d been two years ago. What they were doing to him in that prison \u2026\nFucking Hel.\nHunt could take a few guesses about the manner of torture. The\nmemories of it being inflicted upon him still dragged him from sleep.\nBryce was blinking at Briggs. \u201cWhat do you mean, you liked her?\u201d\nBriggs smiled, savoring Quinlan\u2019s surprise. \u201cShe circled me and my\nagents for weeks. She even met with me twice. Told me to stop my plans\u2014\nor else she\u2019d have to bring me in. Well, that was the first time. The second\ntime she warned me that she had enough evidence against me that she had\nto bring me in, but I could get off easy if I admitted to my plotting and\nended it then and there. I didn\u2019t listen then, either. That third time \u2026 She\nbrought her pack, and that was that.\u201d\nHunt reined in his emotions, setting his features into neutrality.\n\u201cDanika went easy on you?\u201d Bryce\u2019s face had drained of color. It took\na surprising amount of effort not to touch her hand.\n\u201cShe tried to.\u201d Briggs ran gnarled fingers down his pristine jumpsuit.\n\u201cFor a Vanir, she was fair. I don\u2019t think she necessarily disagreed with us.\nWith my methods, yes, but I thought she might have been a sympathizer.\u201d\nHe surveyed Bryce again with a starkness that had Hunt\u2019s hackles rising.\nHunt suppressed a growl at the term. \u201cYour followers knew this?\u201d\n\u201cYes. I think she even let some of them get away that night.\u201d\nHunt blew out a breath. \u201cThat is a big fucking claim to make against\nan Aux leader.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s dead, isn\u2019t she? Who cares?\u201d\nBryce flinched. Enough so that Hunt didn\u2019t hold back his growl this\ntime.\n\u201cDanika wasn\u2019t a rebel sympathizer,\u201d Bryce hissed.\nBriggs looked down his nose at her. \u201cNot yet, maybe,\u201d he agreed, \u201cbut\nDanika could have been starting down that path. Maybe she saw how her\npretty, half-breed friend was treated by others and didn\u2019t like it too much,\neither.\u201d He smiled knowingly when Bryce blinked at his correct guess\nregarding her relationship to Danika. The emotions he\u2019d probably read in\nher face.\nBriggs went on, \u201cMy followers knew Danika was a potential asset.\nWe\u2019d discussed it, right up until the raid. And that night, Danika and her\npack were fair with us. We fought, and even managed to get in a few good\nblows on that Second of hers.\u201d He whistled. \u201cConnor Holstrom.\u201d Bryce\nwent utterly rigid. \u201cGuy was a bruiser.\u201d From the cruel curve of his lips,\nhe\u2019d clearly noticed how stiff she\u2019d gone at the mention of Connor\u2019s name.\n\u201cWas Holstrom your boyfriend? Pity.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s none of your business.\u201d The words were flat as Briggs\u2019s eyes.\nThey tightened something in Hunt\u2019s chest, her words. The vacancy in\nher voice.\nHunt asked him, \u201cYou never mentioned any of this when you were\ninitially arrested?\u201d\nBriggs spat, \u201cWhy the fuck would I ever rat out a potentially\nsympathetic, incredibly powerful Vanir like Danika Fendyr? I might have\nbeen headed for this\u201d\u2014he gestured to the cell around them\u2014\u201cbut the cause\nwould live on. It had to live on, and I knew that someone like Danika could\nbe a mighty ally to have on our side.\u201d\nHunt cut in, \u201cBut why not mention any of this during your murder\ntrial?\u201d\n\u201cMy trial? You mean that two-day sham they televised? With that\nlawyer the Governor assigned me?\u201d Briggs laughed and laughed. Hunt had\nto remind himself that this was an imprisoned man, enduring unspeakable\ntorture. And not someone he could punch in the face. Not even for the way\nhis laugh made Quinlan shift in her seat. \u201cI knew they\u2019d pin it on me no\nmatter what. Knew that even if I told the truth, I\u2019d wind up here. So on the\nchance that Danika might have friends still living who shared her\nsentiments, I kept her secrets to myself.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re ratting her out now,\u201d Bryce said.\nBut Briggs didn\u2019t reply to that, and instead studied the dented metal\ntable. \u201cI said it two years ago, and I\u2019ll say it again now: Keres didn\u2019t kill\nDanika or the Pack of Devils. The White Raven bombing, though\u2014they\nmight have managed that. Good for them if they did.\u201d\nHunt ground his teeth. Had he been this out of touch with reality when\nhe\u2019d followed Shahar? Had it been this level of fanaticism that prompted\nhim to lead the angels of the 18th to Mount Hermon? In those last days,\nwould he have even listened to anyone if they\u2019d advised against it?\nA hazy memory surfaced, of Isaiah doing just that, screaming in Hunt\u2019s\nwar tent. Fuck.\nBriggs asked, \u201cDid a lot of Vanir die in the bombing?\u201d\nDisgust curdled Bryce\u2019s face. \u201cNo,\u201d she said, standing from her chair.\n\u201cNot a single one.\u201d She spoke with the imperiousness of a queen. Hunt\ncould only rise with her.\nBriggs tsked. \u201cToo bad.\u201d\nHunt\u2019s fingers balled into fists. He\u2019d been so wildly in love with\nShahar, with the cause\u2014had he been no better than this man?\nBryce said tightly, \u201cThank you for answering our questions.\u201d Without\nwaiting for Briggs to reply, she hurried for the door. Hunt kept a step behind\nher, even with Briggs anchored to the table.\nThat she\u2019d ended the meeting so quickly showed Hunt that Bryce\nshared his opinion: Briggs truly hadn\u2019t killed Danika.\nHe\u2019d nearly reached the open doorway when Briggs said to him,\n\u201cYou\u2019re one of the Fallen, huh?\u201d Hunt paused. Briggs smiled. \u201cTons of\nrespect for you, man.\u201d He surveyed Hunt from head to toe. \u201cWhat part of\nthe 18th did you serve in?\u201d\nHunt said nothing. But Briggs\u2019s blue eyes shone. \u201cWe\u2019ll bring the\nbastards down someday, brother.\u201d\nHunt glanced toward Bryce, already halfway down the hallway, her\nsteps swift. Like she couldn\u2019t stand to breathe the same air as the man\nchained to the table, like she had to get out of this awful place. Hunt himself\nhad been here, interrogated people, more often than he cared to remember.\nAnd the kill he\u2019d made last night \u2026 It had lingered. Ticked off another\nlife-debt, but it had lingered.\nBriggs was still staring at him, waiting for Hunt to speak. The\nagreement that Hunt would have voiced weeks ago now dissolved on his\ntongue.\nNo, he\u2019d been no better than this man.\nHe didn\u2019t know where that put him.\n\u201cSo Briggs and his followers are off the list,\u201d Bryce said, folding her feet\nbeneath her on her living room couch. Syrinx was already snoring beside\nher. \u201cUnless you think he was lying?\u201d\nHunt, seated at the other end of the sectional, frowned at the sunball\ngame just starting on TV. \u201cHe was telling the truth. I\u2019ve dealt with enough\n\u2026 prisoners to sense when someone\u2019s lying.\u201d\nThe words were clipped. He\u2019d been on edge since they\u2019d left the\nComitium through the same unmarked street door they\u2019d used to enter. No\nchance of running into Sandriel that way.\nHunt pointed to the papers Bryce had brought from the gallery, noting\nsome of Danika\u2019s movements and the list of names she\u2019d compiled.\n\u201cRemind me who\u2019s the next suspect on your list?\u201d\nBryce didn\u2019t answer as she observed his profile, the light of the screen\nbouncing off his cheekbones, deepening the shadow beneath his strong jaw.\nHe truly was pretty. And really seemed to be in a piss-poor mood.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201cNothing.\u201d\n\u201cSays the guy who\u2019s grinding his teeth so hard I can hear them.\u201d\nHunt cut her a glare and spread a muscled arm along the back of the\ncouch. He\u2019d changed when they\u2019d returned thirty minutes ago, having\ngrabbed a quick bite at a noodles-and-dumplings food cart just down the\nblock, and now wore a soft gray T-shirt, black sweats, and a white sunball\ncap turned backward.\nIt was the hat that had proven the most confusing\u2014so ordinary and \u2026\nguy-ish, for lack of a better word, that she\u2019d been stealing glances at him for\nthe past fifteen minutes. Stray locks of his dark hair curled around the\nedges, the adjustable band nearly covered the tattoo over his brow, and she\nhad no idea why, but it was all just \u2026 Disgustingly distracting.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked, noting her gaze.\nBryce reached forward, her long braid slipping over a shoulder, and\ngrabbed his phone from the coffee table. She snapped a photo of him and\nsent a copy to herself, mostly because she doubted anyone would believe\nher that Hunt fucking Athalar was sitting on her couch in casual clothes,\nsunball hat on backward, watching TV and drinking a beer.\nThe Shadow of Death, everyone.\n\u201cThat\u2019s annoying,\u201d he said through his teeth.\n\u201cSo is your face,\u201d she said sweetly, tossing the phone to him. Hunt\npicked it up, snapped a photo of her, and then set it down, eyes on the game\nagain.\nShe let him watch for another minute before she said, \u201cYou\u2019ve been\nbroody since Briggs.\u201d\nHis mouth twisted toward the side. \u201cSorry.\u201d\n\u201cWhy are you apologizing?\u201d\nHis fingers traced a circle along the couch cushion. \u201cIt brought up\nsome bad shit. About\u2014about the way I helped lead Shahar\u2019s rebellion.\u201d\nShe considered, retracing every horrid word and exchange in that cell\nbeneath the Comitium.\nOh. Oh. She said carefully, \u201cYou\u2019re nothing like Briggs, Hunt.\u201d\nHis dark eyes slid toward her. \u201cYou don\u2019t know me well enough to say\nthat.\u201d\n\u201cDid you willingly and gleefully risk innocent lives to further your\nrebellion?\u201d\nHis mouth thinned. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cWell, there you have it.\u201d\nAgain, his jaw worked. Then he said, \u201cBut I was blind. About a lot of\nthings.\u201d\n\u201cLike what?\u201d\n\u201cJust a lot,\u201d he hedged. \u201cLooking at Briggs, what they\u2019re doing to him\n\u2026 I don\u2019t know why it bothered me this time. I\u2019ve been down there often\nenough with other prisoners that\u2014I mean \u2026\u201d His knee bounced. He said\nwithout looking at her, \u201cYou know what kinda shit I have to do.\u201d\nShe said gently, \u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cBut for whatever reason, seeing Briggs like that today, it just made\nme remember my own \u2026\u201d He trailed off again and swigged from his beer.\nIcy, oily dread filled her stomach, twisting with the fried noodles she\u2019d\ninhaled thirty minutes ago. \u201cHow long did they do that to you\u2014after Mount\nHermon?\u201d\n\u201cSeven years.\u201d\nShe closed her eyes as the weight of those words rippled through her.\nHunt said, \u201cI lost track of time, too. The Asteri dungeons are so far\nbeneath the earth, so lightless, that days are years and years are days and \u2026\nWhen they let me out, I went right to the Archangel Ramuel. My first \u2026\nhandler. He continued the pattern for two years, got bored with it, and\nrealized that I\u2019d be more useful dispatching demons and doing his bidding\nthan rotting away in his torture chambers.\u201d\n\u201cBurning Solas, Hunt,\u201d she whispered.\nHe still didn\u2019t look at her. \u201cBy the time Ramuel decided to let me serve\nas his assassin, it had been nine years since I\u2019d seen sunlight. Since I\u2019d\nheard the wind or smelled the rain. Since I\u2019d seen grass, or a river, or a\nmountain. Since I\u2019d flown.\u201d\nHer hands shook enough that she crossed her arms, tucking her fingers\ntight to her body. \u201cI\u2014I am so sorry.\u201d\nHis eyes turned distant, glazed. \u201cHatred was the only thing that fueled\nme through it. Briggs\u2019s kind of hatred. Not hope, not love. Only\nunrelenting, raging hatred. For the Archangels. For the Asteri. For all of it.\u201d\nHe finally looked at her, his eyes as hollow as Briggs\u2019s had been. \u201cSo, yeah.\nI might not have ever been willing to kill innocents to help Shahar\u2019s\nrebellion, but that\u2019s the only difference between me and Briggs. Still is.\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t let herself reconsider before she took his hand.\nShe hadn\u2019t realized how much bigger Hunt\u2019s hand was until hers\ncoiled around it. Hadn\u2019t realized how many calluses lay on his palms and\nfingers until they rasped against her skin.\nHunt glanced down at their hands, her dusk-painted nails contrasting\nwith the deep gold of his skin. She found herself holding her breath, waiting\nfor him to snatch his hand back, and asked, \u201cDo you still feel like hatred is\nall that gets you through the day?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said, eyes lifting from their hands to scan her face.\n\u201cSometimes, for some things, yes, but \u2026 No, Quinlan.\u201d\nShe nodded, but he was still watching her, so she reached for the\nspreadsheets.\n\u201cYou have nothing else to say?\u201d Hunt\u2019s mouth twisted to the side.\n\u201cYou, the person who has an opinion on everything and everyone, have\nnothing else to say about what I just told you?\u201d\nShe pushed her braid over her shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re not like Briggs,\u201d she\nsaid simply.\nHe frowned. And began to withdraw his hand from hers.\nBryce clamped her fingers around his. \u201cYou might see yourself that\nway, but I see you, too, Athalar. I see your kindness and your \u2026 whatever.\u201d\nShe squeezed his hand for emphasis. \u201cI see all the shit you conveniently\nforget. Briggs is a bad person. He might have once gotten into the human\nrebellion for the right reasons, but he is a bad person. You aren\u2019t. You will\nnever be. End of story.\u201d\n\u201cThis bargain I\u2019ve got with Micah suggests otherwise\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not like him.\u201d\nThe weight of his stare pressed on her skin, warmed her face.\nShe withdrew her hand as casually as she could, trying not to note how\nhis own fingers seemed hesitant to let go. But she leaned forward,\nstretching out her arm, and flicked his hat. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with this, by the\nway?\u201d\nHe batted her away. \u201cIt\u2019s a hat.\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t fit with your whole predator-in-the-night image.\u201d\nFor a heartbeat, he was utterly silent. Then he laughed, tipping back\nhis head. The strong tan column of his throat worked with the movement,\nand Bryce crossed her arms again.\n\u201cAh, Quinlan,\u201d he said, shaking his head. He swept the hat off his head\nand plunked it down atop her own. \u201cYou\u2019re merciless.\u201d\nShe grinned, twisting the cap backward the way he\u2019d worn it, and\nprimly shuffled the papers. \u201cLet\u2019s look this over again. Since Briggs was a\nbust, and the Viper Queen\u2019s out \u2026 maybe there\u2019s something with Danika at\nLuna\u2019s Temple the night the Horn was stolen that we\u2019re missing.\u201d\nHe drifted closer, his thigh grazing her bent knee, and peered at the\npapers in her lap. She watched his eyes slide over them as he studied the list\nof locations. And tried not to think about the warmth of that thigh against\nher leg. The solid muscle of it.\nThen he lifted his head.\nHe was close enough that she realized his eyes weren\u2019t black after all,\nbut rather a shade of darkest brown. \u201cWe\u2019re idiots.\u201d\n\u201cAt least you said we.\u201d\nHe snickered, but didn\u2019t pull back. Didn\u2019t move that powerful leg of\nhis. \u201cThe temple has exterior cameras. They would have been recording the\nnight the Horn was stolen.\u201d\n\u201cYou make it sound as if the 33rd didn\u2019t check that two years ago.\nThey said the blackout rendered any footage essentially useless.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe we didn\u2019t run the right tests on the footage. Look at the right\nfields. Ask the right people to examine it. If Danika was there that night,\nwhy didn\u2019t anyone know that? Why didn\u2019t she come forward about being at\nthe temple when the Horn was stolen? Why didn\u2019t the acolyte say anything\nabout her presence?\u201d\nBryce chewed on her lip. Hunt\u2019s eyes dipped to it. She could have\nsworn they darkened. That his thigh pressed harder into hers. As if in\nchallenge\u2014a dare to see if she\u2019d back down.\nShe didn\u2019t, but her voice turned hoarse as she said, \u201cYou think Danika\nmight have known who took the Horn\u2014and she tried to hide it?\u201d She shook\nher head. \u201cDanika wouldn\u2019t have done that. She barely seemed to care that\nthe Horn had been stolen at all.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cBut let\u2019s start by looking at the footage, even\nif it\u2019s a whole lot of nothing. And send it to someone who can give us a\nmore comprehensive analysis.\u201d He swiped his hat off her head, and put it\nback on his own\u2014still backward, still with those little curling pieces of hair\npeeking around the edges. As if for good measure, he tugged the end of her\nbraid, then folded his hands behind his head as he went back to watching\nthe game.\nThe absence of his leg against hers was like a cold slap. \u201cWho do you\nhave in mind?\u201d\nHis mouth just curved upward."}, "36": {"Name": "PART II THE TRENCH-Chapter 36", "Page Content": " 6 \nThe three-level shooting range in Moonwood catered to a lethal, creative\nclientele. Occupying a converted warehouse that stretched four city blocks\nalong the Istros, it boasted the only sniper-length gallery in the city.\nHunt stopped by every few weeks to keep his skills sharp, usually in\nthe dead of night when no one could gawk at the Umbra Mortis donning a\npair of earmuffs and military-grade glasses as he walked through the\nconcrete hallways to one of the private galleries.\nIt had been late when he\u2019d gotten the idea for this meeting, and then\nJesiba had slammed Quinlan with work the next day, so they\u2019d decided to\nwait until nightfall to see where their quarry wound up. Hunt had bet Bryce\na gold mark it\u2019d be a tattoo parlor, and she\u2019d raised him to two gold marks\nthat it\u2019d be a fake-grungy rock bar. But when she\u2019d gotten the reply to her\nmessage, it had led them here.\nThe sniper gallery lay on the northern end of the building, accessible\nthrough a heavy metal door that sealed off any sound. They grabbed\nelectronic earmuffs that would stifle the boom of the guns\u2014but still allow\nthem to hear each other\u2019s voices\u2014on the way in. Before he entered the\ngallery, Hunt glanced over a shoulder at Bryce, checking that her earmuffs\nwere in place.\nShe noted his assessing look and chuckled. \u201cMother hen.\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want your pretty little ears to get blown out, Quinlan.\u201d He\ndidn\u2019t give her the chance to reply as he opened the door, thumping music\nblasting to greet them, and beheld the three males lined up along a waist-\nhigh glass barrier.\nLord Tristan Flynn had a sniper rifle aimed toward a person-shaped\npaper target at the far, far end of the space, so distant a mortal could barely\nmake it out. He\u2019d opted out of using the scope, instead relying on his keen\nFae eyesight as Danaan and Declan Emmet stood near him, their own rifles\nhanging off their shoulders.\nRuhn nodded their way, and motioned to wait a moment.\n\u201cHe\u2019s gonna miss,\u201d Emmet observed over the bumping bass of the\nmusic, barely sparing Hunt and Bryce a glance. \u201cOff by a half inch.\u201d\n\u201cScrew you, Dec,\u201d Flynn muttered, and fired. The gunshot erupted\nthrough the space, the sound absorbed by the padding along the ceiling and\nwalls, and at the far end of the gallery, the piece of paper swayed, the torso\nrippling.\nFlynn lowered the rifle. \u201cStraight shot to the balls, dickbags.\u201d He held\nout his palm toward Ruhn. \u201cPay up.\u201d\nRuhn rolled his eyes and slammed a gold coin into it as he turned to\nHunt and Bryce.\nHunt glanced at the prince\u2019s two friends, who were now sizing him up\nas they pulled off their earmuffs and eye gear. He and Bryce followed suit.\nHe didn\u2019t expect the tinge of envy curdling in his gut at the sight of the\nfriends together. A glance at Quinlan\u2019s stiff shoulders had him wondering if\nshe felt the same\u2014if she was remembering nights with Danika and the Pack\nof Devils when they\u2019d had nothing better to do than give each other grief\nover nonsense.\nBryce shook it off faster than Hunt did as she drawled, \u201cSorry to\ninterrupt you boys playing commando, but we have some adult things to\ndiscuss.\u201d\nRuhn set his rifle on the metal table to his left and leaned against the\nglass barrier. \u201cYou could have called.\u201d\nBryce strode to the table to examine the gun her cousin had set down.\nHer nails glimmered against the matte black. Stealth weapons, designed to\nblend into shadows and not give away their bearer with a gleam. \u201cI didn\u2019t\nwant this intel out there in the networks.\u201d\nFlynn flashed a grin. \u201cCloak-and-dagger shit. Nice.\u201d He sidled up to\nher at the table, close enough that Hunt found himself tensing. \u201cColor me\nintrigued.\u201d\nQuinlan\u2019s gift of looking down her nose at males who towered above\nher usually grated on Hunt to no end. But seeing it used on someone else\nwas a true delight.\nYet that imperious look only seemed to make Flynn\u2019s grin grow wider,\nespecially as Bryce said, \u201cI\u2019m not here to talk to you.\u201d\n\u201cYou wound me, Bryce,\u201d Flynn drawled.\nDeclan Emmet snickered. \u201cYou up to do some more hacking shit?\u201d\nQuinlan asked him.\n\u201cCall it shit again, Bryce, and see if I help you,\u201d Declan said coolly.\n\u201cSorry, sorry. Your technology \u2026 stuff.\u201d She waved a hand. \u201cWe need\nanalysis of some footage from Luna\u2019s Temple the night the Horn was\nstolen.\u201d\nRuhn went still, his blue eyes flaring as he said to Hunt, \u201cYou\u2019ve got a\nlead on the Horn?\u201d\nHunt said, \u201cJust laying out the puzzle pieces.\u201d\nDeclan rubbed his neck. \u201cAll right. What are you looking for exactly?\u201d\n\u201cEverything,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cAnything that might come up on the audio\nor thermal, or if there\u2019s a way to make the video any clearer despite the\nblackout.\u201d\nDeclan set down his rifle beside Ruhn\u2019s. \u201cI might have some software\nthat can help, but no promises. If the investigators didn\u2019t find anything two\nyears ago, the odds are slim I\u2019ll find any anomalies now.\u201d\n\u201cWe know,\u201d Bryce said. \u201cHow long would it take you to look?\u201d\nHe seemed to do some mental calculations. \u201cGive me a few days. I\u2019ll\nsee what I can find.\u201d\n\u201cThank you.\u201d\nFlynn let out an exaggerated gasp. \u201cI think that\u2019s the first time you\u2019ve\never said those words to us, B.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t get used to it.\u201d She surveyed them again with that cool,\nmocking indifference that made Hunt\u2019s pulse begin to pound as drivingly as\nthe beat of the music playing through the chamber\u2019s speakers. \u201cWhy are\nyou three even here?\u201d\n\u201cWe do actually work for the Aux, Bryce. That requires the occasional\nbit of training.\u201d\n\u201cSo where\u2019s the rest of your unit?\u201d She made a show of looking\naround. Hunt didn\u2019t bother to hide his mirth. \u201cOr was this a roomies-only\nkind of thing?\u201d\nDeclan chuckled. \u201cThis was an invite-only session.\u201d\nBryce rolled her eyes and said to Ruhn, \u201cI\u2019m sure the Autumn King\ntold you he wants reports on our movements.\u201d She crossed her arms. \u201cKeep\nthis\u201d\u2014she gestured to all of them\u2014\u201cquiet for a few days.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re asking me to lie to my king,\u201d Ruhn said, frowning.\n\u201cI\u2019m asking you not to tell him about this for the moment,\u201d Bryce said.\nFlynn lifted a brow. \u201cAre you saying the Autumn King is one of your\nsuspects?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m saying I want shit kept quiet.\u201d She grinned at Ruhn, showing all\nher white teeth, the expression more savage than amused. \u201cI\u2019m saying if\nyou three morons leak any of this to your Aux buddies or drunken hookups,\nI am going to be very unhappy.\u201d\nHonestly, Hunt would have liked nothing more than to grab some\npopcorn and a beer, kick back in a chair, and watch her verbally fillet these\nassholes.\n\u201cSounds like a whole lot of big talk,\u201d Ruhn said, then indicated the\ntarget at the back of the room. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you put on a little demonstration\nfor Athalar, Bryce?\u201d\nShe smirked. \u201cI don\u2019t need to prove I can handle a big gun to run with\nthe boys\u2019 club.\u201d Hunt\u2019s skin tightened at the feral delight in her eyes as she\nsaid big gun. Other parts of him tightened, too.\nTristan Flynn said, \u201cTwenty gold marks says we outshoot you.\u201d\n\u201cOnly rich-ass pieces of shit have twenty gold marks to blow on\nbullshit contests,\u201d Bryce said, amber eyes dancing with amusement as she\nwinked at Hunt. His blood thrummed, his body tensing as surely as if she\u2019d\ngripped his cock. But her gaze already drifted to the distant target.\nShe snapped the earmuffs over her arched ears.\nFlynn rubbed his hands together. \u201cHere we fuckin\u2019 go.\u201d\nBryce popped on the glasses, adjusted her ponytail, and hefted Ruhn\u2019s\nrifle into her hands. She weighed it in her arms, and Hunt couldn\u2019t drag his\neyes away from the way her fingers brushed over the chassis, stroking all\nthe way down to the butt plate.\nHe swallowed hard, but she merely fitted the gun to her shoulder, each\nmovement as comfortable as he\u2019d expect from someone raised by a\nlegendary sharpshooter. She clicked off the safety and didn\u2019t bother to use\nthe scope as she said to none of them in particular, \u201cAllow me to\ndemonstrate why you all can kiss my fucking ass.\u201d\nThree shots cracked over the music, one after another, her body\nabsorbing the kickback of the gun like a champ. Hunt\u2019s mouth dried out\nentirely.\nThey all peered up at the screen with the feed of the target.\n\u201cYou only landed one,\u201d Flynn snorted, eyeing the hole through the\nheart of the target.\n\u201cNo, she didn\u2019t,\u201d Emmet murmured, just as Hunt saw it, too: the circle\nwasn\u2019t perfect. No, two of its edges bulged outward\u2014barely noticeable.\nThree shots, so precise that they\u2019d passed through the same small\nspace.\nA chill skittered down Hunt\u2019s body that had nothing to do with fear as\nBryce merely reset the safety, placed the rifle on the table, and removed the\nearmuffs and glasses.\nShe turned, and her eyes met Hunt\u2019s again\u2014a new sort of vulnerability\nshining beneath the self-satisfied narrowing. A challenge thrown down.\nWaiting to see how he\u2019d react.\nHow many males had run from this part of her, their alphahole egos\nthreatened by it? Hunt hated them all merely for putting the question in her\neyes.\nHe didn\u2019t hear whatever shit Flynn was saying as he put on the\nearmuffs and eye gear and took up the rifle Bryce had set down, the metal\nstill warm from her body. He didn\u2019t hear Ruhn asking him something as he\nlined up his shot.\nNo, Hunt only met Bryce\u2019s stare as he clicked off the safety.\nThat click reverberated between them, loud as a thunderclap. Her\nthroat bobbed.\nHunt pulled his gaze from hers and fired one round. With his eagle-\nsharp vision, he didn\u2019t need the scope to see the bullet pass through the hole\nshe\u2019d made.\nWhen he lowered the gun, he found Bryce\u2019s cheeks flushed, her eyes\nlike warm whiskey. A quiet sort of light shone in them.\nHe still didn\u2019t hear any of what the males were saying, only had the\nvague notion of even Ruhn cursing with appreciation. Hunt just held\nBryce\u2019s stare.\nI see you, Quinlan, he silently conveyed to her. And I like all of it.\nRight back at you, her half smile seemed to say.\nHunt\u2019s phone rang, dragging his eyes from the smile that made the\nfloor a little uneven. He fished it from his pocket with fingers that were\nsurprisingly shaky. Isaiah Tiberian flashed on the screen. He answered\ninstantly. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d\nHunt knew Bryce and the Fae males could hear every word as Isaiah\nsaid, \u201cGet your asses over to Asphodel Meadows. There\u2019s been another\nmurder.\u201d"}, "37": {"Name": "PART II THE TRENCH-Chapter 37", "Page Content": " 7 \n\u201cWhere?\u201d Hunt demanded into the phone, one eye on Quinlan, her arms\ncrossed tight as she listened. All that light had vanished from her eyes.\nIsaiah told him the address. A good two miles away. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a team\nalready setting up camp,\u201d the commander said.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be there in a few,\u201d Hunt answered, and hung up.\nThe three Fae males, having heard as well, began packing their gear\nwith swift efficiency. Well trained. Total pains in his ass, but they were well\ntrained.\nBut Bryce fidgeted, hands twitching at her sides. He\u2019d seen that stark\nlook before. And the fake-ass calm that crept over her as Ruhn and his\nfriends glanced at her.\nThen, Hunt had bought into it, essentially bullied her into going to that\nother murder scene.\nHunt said without looking at the males, \u201cI take it you heard the\naddress.\u201d He didn\u2019t wait for any of them to confirm before he ordered,\n\u201cWe\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d Quinlan\u2019s eyes flickered, but Hunt didn\u2019t take his\nfocus off her as he walked closer. He sensed Danaan, Flynn, and Emmet\nleaving the gallery, but didn\u2019t look to confirm as he halted before her.\nThe cold emptiness of the sniper range yawned around them.\nAgain, Quinlan\u2019s hands curled, fingers wiggling at her sides. Like she\ncould shake the dread and pain away. Hunt said calmly, \u201cYou want me to\nhandle it?\u201d\nColor crept over her freckled cheeks. She pointed to the door with a\nshaking finger. \u201cSomeone died while we were dicking around tonight.\u201d\nHunt wrapped his hand around her finger. Lowered it to the space\nbetween them. \u201cThis guilt isn\u2019t on you. It\u2019s on whoever is doing this.\u201d\nPeople like him, butchering in the night.\nShe tried to yank her finger back, and he let go, remembering her\nwariness of male Vanir. Of alphaholes.\nBryce\u2019s throat bobbed, and she peered around his wing. \u201cI want to go\nto the scene of the crime.\u201d He waited for the rest of it. She blew out an\nuneven breath. \u201cI need to go,\u201d she said, more to herself. Her foot tapped on\nthe concrete floor, in time to the beat of the still-thumping music. She\nwinced. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want Ruhn or his friends seeing me like this.\u201d\n\u201cLike what?\u201d It was normal, expected, to be screwed up by what she\u2019d\nendured.\n\u201cLike a fucking mess.\u201d Her eyes glowed.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s none of their business, but they\u2019ll make it their business\nif they see. They\u2019re Fae males\u2014sticking their noses into places they don\u2019t\nbelong is an art form for them.\u201d\nHunt huffed a laugh. \u201cTrue.\u201d\nShe exhaled again. \u201cOkay,\u201d she murmured. \u201cOkay.\u201d Her hands still\nshook, as if her bloody memories swarmed her.\nIt was instinct to take her hands in his own.\nThey trembled like glasses rattling on a shelf. Felt as delicate, even\nwith the slick, clammy sweat coating them.\n\u201cTake a breath,\u201d Hunt said, squeezing her fingers gently.\nBryce closed her eyes, head bowing as she obeyed.\n\u201cAnother,\u201d he commanded.\nShe did.\n\u201cAnother.\u201d\nSo Quinlan breathed, Hunt not letting go of her hands until the sweat\ndried. Until she lifted her head. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said again, and this time, the\nword was solid.\n\u201cYou good?\u201d\n\u201cAs good as I\u2019ll ever be,\u201d she said, but her gaze had cleared.\nUnable to help himself, he brushed back a loose tendril of her hair. It\nslid like cool silk against his fingers as he hooked it behind her arched ear.\n\u201cYou and me both, Quinlan.\u201d\nBryce let Hunt fly her to the crime scene. The alley in the Asphodel\nMeadows was about as seedy as they came: overflowing dumpster, suspect\npuddles of liquid gleaming, rail-thin animals rooting through the trash,\nbroken glass sparkling in the firstlight from the rusting lamppost.\nGlowing blue magi-screens already blocked off the alley entrance. A\nfew technicians and legionaries were on the scene, Isaiah Tiberian, Ruhn,\nand his friends among them.\nThe alley lay just off Main Street, in the shadow of the North Gate\u2014\nthe Mortal Gate, most people called it. Apartment buildings loomed, most\nof them public, all in dire need of repairs. The noises from the cramped\navenue beyond the alley echoed off the crumbling brick walls, the cloying\nreek of trash stuffing itself up her nose. Bryce tried not to inhale too much.\nHunt surveyed the alley and murmured, a strong hand on the small of\nher back, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to look, Bryce.\u201d\nWhat he\u2019d done for her just now in that shooting range \u2026 She\u2019d never\nlet anyone, even her parents, see her like that before. Those moments when\nshe couldn\u2019t breathe. She usually went into a bathroom or bailed for a few\nhours or went for a run.\nThe instinct to flee had been nearly as overwhelming as the panic and\ndread searing her chest, but \u2026 she\u2019d seen Hunt come in from his mission\nthe other night. Knew he of all people might get it.\nHe had. And hadn\u2019t balked for one second.\nJust as he hadn\u2019t balked from seeing her shoot that target, and instead\nanswered it with a shot of his own. Like they were two of a kind, like she\ncould throw anything at him and he\u2019d catch it. Would meet every challenge\nwith that wicked, feral grin.\nShe could have sworn the warmth from his hands still lingered on her\nown.\nWhatever conversation they\u2019d been having with Isaiah over, Flynn and\nDeclan strode for the magi-screen. Ruhn stood ten feet beyond them,\ntalking to a beautiful, dark-haired medwitch. No doubt asking about what\nshe\u2019d assessed.\nPeering around the glowing blue edge to the body hidden beyond,\nFlynn and Declan swore.\nHer stomach bottomed out. Maybe coming here had been a bad idea.\nShe leaned slightly into Hunt\u2019s touch.\nHis fingers dug into her back in silent reassurance before he\nmurmured, \u201cI can look for us.\u201d\nUs, like they were a unit against this fucking mess of a world.\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said, her voice mercifully calm. But she didn\u2019t move\ntoward the screen.\nFlynn pulled away from the blocked-off body and asked Isaiah, \u201cHow\nfresh is this kill?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re putting the TOD at thirty minutes ago,\u201d Isaiah answered\ngravely. \u201cFrom the remains of the clothes, it looks like it was one of the\nguards at Luna\u2019s Temple. He was on his way home.\u201d\nSilence rippled around them. Bryce\u2019s stomach dropped.\nHunt swore. \u201cI\u2019m gonna take a guess and say he was on duty the night\nthe Horn was stolen?\u201d\nIsaiah nodded. \u201cIt was the first thing I checked.\u201d\nBryce swallowed and said, \u201cWe have to be getting close to something,\nthen. Or the murderer is already one step ahead of us, interrogating and then\nkilling anyone who might have known where the Horn disappeared to.\u201d\n\u201cNone of the cameras caught anything?\u201d Flynn asked, his handsome\nface unusually serious.\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Isaiah said. \u201cIt\u2019s like it knew where they were. Or whoever\nsummoned it did. It stayed out of sight.\u201d\nHunt ran his hand up the length of her spine, a solid, calming sweep,\nand then stepped toward the Commander of the 33rd, his voice low as he\nsaid, \u201cTo know every camera in this city, especially the hidden ones, would\nrequire some clearance.\u201d His words hung there, none of them daring to say\nmore, not in public. Hunt asked, \u201cDid anyone report a sighting of a\ndemon?\u201d\nA DNA technician emerged from the screen, blood staining the knees\nof her white jumpsuit. Like she\u2019d knelt in it while she gathered the sample\nkit dangling from her gloved fingers.\nBryce glanced away again, back toward Main Street.\nIsaiah shook his head. \u201cNo reports from civilians or patrols yet.\u201d\nBryce barely heard him as the facts poured into her mind. Main Street.\nShe pulled out her phone, drawing up the map of the city. Her location\npinged, a red dot on the network of streets.\nThe males were still talking about the scant evidence when she placed\na few pins in the map, then squinted at the ground beneath them. Ruhn had\ndrifted over, falling into conversation with his friends as she tuned them\nout.\nBut Hunt noted her focus and turned toward her, his dark brows high.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nShe leaned into the shadow of his wing, and could have sworn he\nfolded it more closely around her. \u201cHere\u2019s a map of where all the murders\nhappened.\u201d\nShe allowed Ruhn and his friends to prowl near. Even deigned to show\nthem her screen, her hands shaking slightly.\n\u201cThis one,\u201d she said, pointing to the blinking dot, \u201cis us.\u201d She pointed\nto another, close by. \u201cThis is where Maximus Tertian died.\u201d She pointed to\nanother, this one near Central Avenue. \u201cThis is the acolyte\u2019s murder.\u201d Her\nthroat constricted, but she pushed past it as she pointed to the other dot, a\nfew blocks due north. \u201cHere\u2019s where \u2026\u201d The words burned. Fuck. Fuck,\nshe had to say it, voice it\u2014\n\u201cDanika and the Pack of Devils were killed,\u201d Hunt supplied.\nBryce threw him a grateful glance. \u201cYes. Do you see what I see?\u201d\n\u201cNo?\u201d Flynn said.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you go to some fancy Fae prep school?\u201d she asked. At Flynn\u2019s\nscowl, she sighed, zooming out on the screen. \u201cLook: all of them took place\nwithin steps of one of the major avenues. On top of the ley lines\u2014natural\nchannels for the firstlight to travel through the city.\u201d\n\u201cHighways of power,\u201d Hunt said, his eyes shining. \u201cThey flow right\nthrough the Gates.\u201d Yeah, Athalar got it. He aimed for where Isaiah stood\ntwenty feet away, talking to a tall, blond nymph in a forensics jacket.\nBryce said to the Fae males, to her wide-eyed brother, \u201cMaybe\nwhoever is summoning this demon is drawing upon the power of these ley\nlines under the city to have the strength to summon it. If all the murders\ntake place near them, maybe that\u2019s how the demon appeared.\u201d\nOne of the Aux team called Ruhn\u2019s name, and her brother merely gave\nher an impressed nod before going over to them. She ignored what that\nadmiration did to her, turning her gaze to Hunt instead as he kept walking\ndown the alley, the powerful muscles of his legs shifting. She heard him call\nto Isaiah as he walked toward the commander, \u201cHave Viktoria run a search\non the cameras along Main, Central, and Ward. See if they catch any blip of\npower\u2014any small surge or drop in temperature that might happen if a\ndemon were summoned.\u201d The kristallos might stay out of sight, but surely\nthe cameras would pick up a slight disturbance in the power flow or\ntemperature. \u201cAnd have her look at the firstlight grid around those times,\ntoo. See if anything registered.\u201d\nDeclan watched the angel stride off, then said to Bryce, \u201cYou know\nwhat he does, right?\u201d\n\u201cLook really good in black?\u201d she said sweetly.\nDeclan growled. \u201cThat demon-hunting is a front. He does the\nGovernor\u2019s dirty work.\u201d His chiseled jaw clenched for a second. \u201cHunt\nAthalar is bad news.\u201d\nShe batted her eyelashes. \u201cGood thing I like bad boys.\u201d\nFlynn let out a low whistle.\nBut Declan shook his head. \u201cThe angels don\u2019t give a shit about\nanyone, B. His goals are not your goals. Athalar\u2019s goals might not even be\nthe same as Micah\u2019s. Be careful.\u201d\nShe nodded to where her brother was again speaking with the stunning\nmedwitch. \u201cI already got the pep talk from Ruhn, don\u2019t worry.\u201d\nDown the alley, Hunt was saying to Isaiah, \u201cCall me if Viktoria gets\nany video of it.\u201d Then he added, as if not quite used to it, \u201cThanks.\u201d\nIn the distance, clouds gathered. Rain had been predicted for the\nmiddle of the night, but it seemed it was arriving sooner.\nHunt stalked back toward them. \u201cThey\u2019re on it.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see if the 33rd follows through this time,\u201d Declan muttered.\n\u201cI\u2019m not holding my breath.\u201d\nHunt straightened. Bryce waited for his defense, but the angel\nshrugged. \u201cMe neither.\u201d\nFlynn jerked his head toward the angels working the scene. \u201cNo\nloyalty?\u201d\nHunt read a message that flashed on his phone\u2019s screen, then pocketed\nit. \u201cI don\u2019t have any choice but to be loyal.\u201d\nAnd to tick off those deaths one by one. Bryce\u2019s stomach twisted.\nDeclan\u2019s amber eyes dropped to the tattoo on Hunt\u2019s wrist. \u201cIt\u2019s fucked\nup.\u201d\nFlynn grumbled his agreement. At least her brother\u2019s friends were on\nthe same page as her regarding the politics of the Asteri.\nHunt looked the males over again. Assessing. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said quietly.\n\u201cIt is.\u201d\n\u201cUnderstatement of the century.\u201d Bryce surveyed the murder scene,\nher body tightening again, not wanting to look. Hunt met her eyes, as if\nsensing that tightening, the shift in her scent. He gave her a subtle nod.\nBryce lifted her chin and declared, \u201cWe\u2019re going now.\u201d\nDeclan waved. \u201cI\u2019ll call you soon, B.\u201d\nFlynn blew her a kiss.\nShe rolled her eyes. \u201cBye.\u201d She caught Ruhn\u2019s stare and motioned her\nfarewell. Her brother threw her a wave, and continued talking to the witch.\nThey made it all of one block before Hunt said, a little too casually,\n\u201cYou and Tristan Flynn ever hook up?\u201d\nBryce blinked. \u201cWhy would you ask that?\u201d\nHe tucked in his wings. \u201cBecause he flirts with you nonstop.\u201d\nShe snorted. \u201cYou wanna tell me about everyone you\u2019ve ever hooked\nup with, Athalar?\u201d\nHis silence told her enough. She smirked.\nBut then the angel said, as if he needed something to distract him from\nthe pulped remains they\u2019d left behind, \u201cNone of my hookups are worth\nmentioning.\u201d He paused again, taking a breath before continuing. \u201cBut\nthat\u2019s because Shahar ruined me for anyone else.\u201d\nRuined me. The words clanged through Bryce.\nHunt went on, eyes swimming with memory, \u201cI grew up in Shahar\u2019s\nterritory in the southeast of Pangera, and as I worked my way up the ranks\nof her legions, I fell in love with her. With her vision for the world. With her\nideas about how the angel hierarchies might change.\u201d He swallowed.\n\u201cShahar was the only one who ever suggested to me that I\u2019d been denied\nanything by being born a bastard. She promoted me through her ranks, until\nI served as her right hand. Until I was her lover.\u201d He blew out a long breath.\n\u201cShe led the rebellion against the Asteri, and I led her forces\u2014the 18th\nLegion. You know how it ended.\u201d\nEveryone in Midgard did. The Daystar would have led the angels\u2014\nmaybe everyone\u2014to a freer world, but she\u2019d been extinguished. Another\ndreamer crushed under the boot heel of the Asteri.\nHunt said, \u201cSo you and Flynn \u2026?\u201d\n\u201cYou tell me this tragic love story and expect me to answer it with my\nbullshit?\u201d His silence was answer enough. She sighed. But\u2014fine. She, too,\nneeded to talk about something to shake off that murder scene. And to\ndispel the shadows that had filled his eyes when he\u2019d spoken of Shahar.\nFor that alone she said, \u201cNo. Flynn and I never hooked up.\u201d She\nsmiled slightly. \u201cWhen I visited Ruhn as a teenager, I was barely able to\nfunction in Flynn\u2019s and Declan\u2019s presence.\u201d Hunt\u2019s mouth curled upward.\n\u201cThey indulged my outrageous flirting, and for a while, I had a fanatic\u2019s\nconviction that Flynn would be my husband one day.\u201d\nHunt snickered, and Bryce elbowed him. \u201cIt\u2019s true. I wrote Lady Bryce\nFlynn on all my school notebooks for two years straight.\u201d\nHe gaped. \u201cYou did not.\u201d\n\u201cI so did. I can prove it: I still have all my notebooks at my parents\u2019\nhouse because my mom refuses to throw anything away.\u201d Her amusement\nfaltered. She didn\u2019t tell him about that time senior year of college when she\nand Danika ran into Flynn and Declan at a bar. How Danika had gone home\nwith Flynn, because Bryce hadn\u2019t wanted to mess up anything between him\nand Ruhn.\n\u201cWant to hear my worst hookup?\u201d she asked, throwing him a forced\ngrin.\nHe chuckled. \u201cI\u2019m half-afraid to hear it, but sure.\u201d\n\u201cI dated a vampyr for like three weeks. My first and only hookup with\nanyone in Flame and Shadow.\u201d\nThe vamps had worked hard to get people to forget the tiny fact that\nthey\u2019d all come from Hel, lesser demons themselves. That their ancestors\nhad defected from their seven princes during the First Wars, and fed the\nAsteri Imperial Legions vital intel that aided in their victory. Traitors and\nturncoats\u2014who still held a demon\u2019s craving for blood.\nHunt lifted a brow. \u201cAnd?\u201d\nBryce winced. \u201cAnd I couldn\u2019t stop wondering what part of me he\nwanted more: blood or \u2026 you know. And then he suggested eating while\neating, if you know what I mean?\u201d\nIt took Hunt a second to sort it out. Then his dark eyes widened. \u201cOh\nfuck. Really?\u201d She didn\u2019t fail to note his glance to her legs\u2014between them.\nThe way his eyes seemed to darken further, something within them\nsharpening. \u201cWouldn\u2019t that hurt?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to find out.\u201d\nHunt shook his head, and she wondered if he was unsure whether to\ncringe or laugh. But the light had come back to his eyes. \u201cNo more vamps\nafter that?\u201d\n\u201cDefinitely not. He claimed the finest pleasure was always edged in\npain, but I showed him the door.\u201d\nHunt grunted his approval. Bryce knew she probably shouldn\u2019t, but\nasked carefully, \u201cYou still have a thing for Shahar?\u201d\nA muscle feathered in his jaw. He scanned the skies. \u201cUntil the day I\ndie.\u201d\nNo longing or sorrow graced the words, but she still wasn\u2019t entirely\nsure what to do with the dropping sensation in her stomach.\nHunt\u2019s eyes slid to hers at last. Bleak and lightless. \u201cI don\u2019t see how I\ncan move on from loving her when she gave up everything for me. For the\ncause.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cEvery time I hook up, I remember it.\u201d\n\u201cAh.\u201d No arguing with that. Anything she said against it would sound\nselfish and whiny. And maybe she was dumb, for letting herself read into\nhis leg touching hers or the way he\u2019d looked at her at the shooting range or\ncoaxed her through her panic or any of it.\nHe was staring at her. As if seeing all of that. His throat bobbed.\n\u201cQuinlan, that isn\u2019t to say that I\u2019m not\u2014\u201d\nHis words were cut off by a cluster of people approaching from the\nother end of the street.\nShe glimpsed silvery blond hair and couldn\u2019t breathe. Hunt swore.\n\u201cLet\u2019s get airborne\u2014\u201d\nBut Sabine had spotted them. Her narrow, pale face twisted in a snarl.\nBryce hated the shaking that overtook her hands. The trembling in her\nknees.\nHunt warned Sabine, \u201cKeep moving, Fendyr.\u201d\nSabine ignored him. Her stare was like being pelted with shards of ice.\n\u201cI heard you\u2019ve been showing your face again,\u201d she seethed at Bryce.\n\u201cWhere the fuck is my sword, Quinlan?\u201d\nBryce couldn\u2019t think of anything to say, any retort or explanation. She\njust let Hunt lead her past Sabine, the angel a veritable wall of muscle\nbetween them.\nHunt\u2019s hand rested on Bryce\u2019s back as he nudged her along. \u201cLet\u2019s\ngo.\u201d\n\u201cStupid slut,\u201d Sabine hissed, spitting at Bryce\u2019s feet as she passed.\nHunt stiffened, a growl slipping out, but Bryce gripped his arm in a\nsilent plea to let it go.\nHis teeth gleamed as he bared them over a shoulder at Sabine, but\nBryce whispered, \u201cPlease.\u201d\nHe scanned her face, mouth opening to object. She made them keep\nwalking, even as Sabine\u2019s sneer branded itself into her back.\n\u201cPlease,\u201d Bryce whispered again.\nHis chest heaved, as if it took every bit of effort to reel in his rage, but\nhe faced forward. Sabine\u2019s low, smug laugh rippled toward them.\nHunt\u2019s body locked up, and Bryce squeezed his arm tighter, misery\ncoiling around her gut.\nMaybe he scented it, maybe he read it on her face, but Hunt\u2019s steps\nevened out. His hand again warmed her lower back, a steady presence as\nthey walked, finally crossing the street.\nThey were halfway across Main when Hunt scooped her into his arms,\nnot saying a word as he launched into the brisk skies.\nShe leaned her head against his chest. Let the wind drown out the\nroaring in her mind.\nThey landed on the roof of her building five minutes later, and she\nwould have gone right down to the apartment had he not gripped her arm to\nstop her.\nHunt again scanned her face. Her eyes.\nUs, he\u2019d said earlier. A unit. A team. A two-person pack.\nHunt\u2019s wings shifted slightly in the wind off the Istros. \u201cWe\u2019re going\nto find whoever is behind all this, Bryce. I promise.\u201d\nAnd for some reason, she believed him.\nShe was brushing her teeth when her phone rang.\nDeclan Emmet.\nShe spat out her toothpaste before answering. \u201cHi.\u201d\n\u201cYou still have my number saved? I\u2019m touched, B.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah, yeah. What\u2019s up?\u201d\n\u201cI found something interesting in the footage. The taxpaying residents\nof this city should revolt at how their money\u2019s being blown on second-rate\nanalysts instead of people like me.\u201d\nBryce padded into the hall, then into the great room\u2014then to Hunt\u2019s\ndoor. She knocked on it once, and said to Declan, \u201cAre you going to tell me\nor just gloat about it?\u201d\nHunt opened the door.\nBurning. Fucking. Solas.\nHe wasn\u2019t wearing a shirt, and from the look of it, had been in the\nmiddle of brushing his teeth, too. But she didn\u2019t give a shit about his dental\nhygiene when he looked like that.\nMuscles upon muscles upon muscles, all covered by golden-brown\nskin that glowed in the firstlights. It was outrageous. She\u2019d seen him\nshirtless before, but she hadn\u2019t noticed\u2014not like this.\nShe\u2019d seen more than her fair share of cut, beautiful male bodies, but\nHunt Athalar\u2019s blew them all away.\nHe was pining for a lost love, she reminded herself. Had made that\nvery clear earlier tonight. Through an effort of will, she lifted her eyes and\nfound a shit-eating smirk on his face.\nBut his smug-ass smile faded when she put Declan on speaker. Dec\nsaid, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I should tell you to sit down or not.\u201d\nHunt stepped into the great room, frowning. \u201cJust tell me,\u201d Bryce said.\n\u201cOkay, so I\u2019ll admit someone could easily have made a mistake.\nThanks to the blackout, the footage is just darkness with some sounds.\nOrdinary city sounds of people reacting to the blackout. So I pulled apart\neach audio thread from the street outside the temple. Amped up the ones in\nthe background that the government computers might not have had the tech\nto hear. You know what I heard? People giggling, goading each other to\ntouch it.\u201d\n\u201cPlease tell me this isn\u2019t going to end grossly,\u201d Bryce said. Hunt\nsnorted.\n\u201cIt was people at the Rose Gate. I could hear people at the Rose Gate\nin FiRo daring each other to touch the disk on the dial pad in the blackout,\nto see if it still worked. It did, by the way. But I could also hear them\noohing about the night-blooming flowers on the Gate itself.\u201d\nHunt leaned in, his scent wrapping around her, dizzying her, as he said\ninto the phone, \u201cThe Rose Gate is halfway across the city from Luna\u2019s\nTemple.\u201d\nDeclan chuckled. \u201cHey, Athalar. Enjoying playing houseguest with\nBryce?\u201d\n\u201cJust tell us,\u201d Bryce said, grinding her teeth. Taking a big, careful step\naway from Hunt.\n\u201cSomeone swapped the footage of the temple during the time of the\nHorn\u2019s theft. It was clever fucking work\u2014they patched it right in so that\nthere isn\u2019t so much as a flicker in the time stamp. They picked audio\nfootage that was a near-match for what it would have sounded like at the\ntemple, with the angle of the buildings and everything. Really smart shit.\nBut not smart enough. The 33rd should have come to me. I\u2019d have found an\nerror like that.\u201d\nBryce\u2019s heart pounded. \u201cCan you find who did this?\u201d\n\u201cI already did.\u201d Any smugness faded from Declan\u2019s voice. \u201cI looked at\nwho was responsible for heading up the investigation of the video footage\nthat night. They\u2019d be the only one with the clearance to make a swap like\nthat.\u201d\nBryce tapped her foot on the ground, and Athalar brushed his wing\nagainst her shoulder in quiet reassurance. \u201cWho is it, Dec?\u201d\nDeclan sighed. \u201cLook, I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s this person one hundred\npercent \u2026 but the official who headed up that part of the investigation was\nSabine Fendyr.\u201d\nPART III\nTHE CANYON"}, "38": {"Name": "PART III THE CANYON-Chapter 38", "Page Content": " 8 \n\u201cIt makes sense,\u201d Hunt said carefully, watching Bryce where she sat on the\nrolled arm of her sofa, chewing on her lower lip. She\u2019d barely thanked\nDeclan before hanging up.\nHunt said, \u201cThe demon has been staying out of view of the cameras in\nthe city. Sabine would know where those cameras are, especially if she had\nthe authority to oversee the video footage of criminal cases.\u201d\nSabine\u2019s behavior earlier tonight \u2026 He\u2019d wanted to kill her.\nHe\u2019d seen Bryce laugh in the face of the Viper Queen, go toe-to-toe\nwith Philip Briggs, and taunt three of the most lethal Fae warriors in this\ncity\u2014and yet she\u2019d trembled before Sabine.\nHe hadn\u2019t been able to stand it, her fear and misery and guilt.\nWhen Bryce didn\u2019t reply, he said again, \u201cIt makes sense that Sabine\ncould be behind this.\u201d He sat beside her on the sectional. He\u2019d put on a shirt\na moment ago, even though he\u2019d enjoyed the look of pure admiration on\nBryce\u2019s face as she got an eyeful of him.\n\u201cSabine wouldn\u2019t have killed her own daughter.\u201d\n\u201cYou really believe that?\u201d\nBryce wrapped her arms around her knees. \u201cNo.\u201d In a pair of sleeping\nshorts and an oversize, worn T-shirt, she looked young. Small. Tired.\nHunt said, \u201cEveryone knows that the Prime was considering skipping\nover Sabine to tap Danika to be his heir. That seems like a good fucking\nmotive to me.\u201d He considered again, an old memory snagging his attention.\nHe pulled out his phone and said, \u201cHold on.\u201d\nIsaiah answered on the third ring. \u201cYeah?\u201d\n\u201cHow easily can you access your notes from the observation room the\nnight Danika died?\u201d He didn\u2019t let Isaiah reply before he said, \u201cSpecifically,\ndid you write down what Sabine said to us?\u201d\nIsaiah\u2019s pause was fraught. \u201cTell me you don\u2019t think Sabine killed\nher.\u201d\n\u201cCan you get me the notes?\u201d Hunt pushed. Isaiah swore, but a moment\nlater he said, \u201cAll right, I\u2019ve got it.\u201d Hunt moved closer to Quinlan so she\ncould hear the commander\u2019s voice as he said, \u201cYou want me to recite this\nwhole thing?\u201d\n\u201cJust what she said about Danika. Did you catch it?\u201d\nHe knew Isaiah had. The male took extensive notes on everything.\n\u201cSabine said, Danika couldn\u2019t stay out of trouble.\u201d Bryce stiffened, and\nHunt laid his free hand on her knee, squeezing once. \u201cShe could never keep\nher mouth shut and know when to be quiet around her enemies. And look\nwhat became of her. That stupid little bitch in there is still breathing, and\nDanika is not. Danika should have known better. Hunt, you then asked her\nwhat Danika should have known better about, and Sabine said, All of it.\nStarting with that slut of a roommate.\u201d\nBryce flinched, and Hunt rubbed his thumb over her knee. \u201cThanks,\nIsaiah.\u201d\nIsaiah cleared his throat. \u201cBe careful.\u201d The call ended.\nBryce\u2019s wide eyes glimmered. \u201cWhat Sabine said could be construed a\nlot of ways,\u201d she admitted. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt sounds like Sabine wanted Danika to keep quiet about something.\nMaybe Danika threatened to talk about the Horn\u2019s theft, and Sabine killed\nher for it. \u201d\nBryce\u2019s throat bobbed as she nodded. \u201cWhy wait two years, though?\u201d\n\u201cI suppose that\u2019s what we\u2019ll find out from her.\u201d\n\u201cWhat would Sabine want with a broken artifact? And even if she\nknew how to repair it, what would she do with it?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. And I don\u2019t know if someone else has it and she wants\nit, but\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIf Danika saw Sabine steal it, it\u2019d make sense that Danika never said\nanything. Same with the guard and the acolyte. They were probably too\nscared to come forward.\u201d\n\u201cIt would explain why Sabine swapped the footage. And why it\nfreaked her out when we showed up at the temple, causing her to kill\nanyone who might have seen anything that night. The bomb at the club was\nprobably a way to either intimidate us or kill us while making it look like\nhumans were behind it.\u201d\n\u201cBut \u2026 I don\u2019t think she has it,\u201d Bryce mused, toying with her toes.\nThey were painted a deep ruby. Ridiculous, he told himself. Not the\nalternative. The one that had him imagining tasting each and every one of\nthose toes before slowly working his way up those sleek, bare legs of hers.\nBare legs that were mere inches from him, golden skin gleaming in the\nfirstlights. He forced himself to withdraw his hand from her knee, even as\nhis fingers begged to move, to stroke along her thigh. Higher.\nBryce went on, oblivious to his filthy train of thoughts, \u201cI don\u2019t see\nwhy Sabine would have the Horn and still summon the kristallos.\u201d\nHunt cleared his throat. It\u2019d been a long fucking day. A weird one, if\nthis was where his thoughts had drifted. Honestly, they\u2019d been drifting in\nthis direction since the gun range. Since he\u2019d seen her hold that gun like a\ngods-damned pro.\nHe forced himself to focus. Consider the conversation at hand and not\ncontemplate whether Quinlan\u2019s legs would feel as soft beneath his mouth as\nthey looked. \u201cDon\u2019t forget that Sabine hates Micah\u2019s guts. Beyond silencing\nthe victims, the killings now could also be to undermine him. You saw how\ntied up he is about getting this solved before the Summit. Murders like\nthese, caused by an unknown demon, when Sandriel is here? It\u2019ll make a\nmockery of him. Maximus Tertian was high profile enough to create a\npolitical headache for Micah\u2014Tertian\u2019s death might have just been to fuck\nwith Micah\u2019s standing. For fuck\u2019s sake, she and Sandriel might even be in\non it together, hoping to weaken him in the Asteri\u2019s eyes, so they appoint\nSandriel to Valbara instead. She could easily make Sabine the Prime of all\nValbaran shifters\u2014not just wolves.\u201d\nBryce\u2019s face blanched. No such title existed, but it was within a\nGovernor\u2019s right to create it. \u201cSabine isn\u2019t that type. She\u2019s power hungry,\nbut not on that scale. She thinks petty\u2014is petty. You heard her bitching\nabout Danika\u2019s missing sword.\u201d Bryce idly braided her long hair. \u201cWe\nshouldn\u2019t waste our breath guessing her motives. It could be anything.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re right. We\u2019ve got a damn good reason for thinking she killed\nDanika, but nothing solid enough to explain these new murders.\u201d He\nwatched her long, delicate fingers twine through her hair. Made himself\nlook at the darkened television screen instead. \u201cCatching her with the\ndemon would prove her involvement.\u201d\n\u201cYou think Viktoria can find that footage we requested?\u201d\n\u201cI hope so,\u201d he said. Hunt mulled it over. Sabine\u2014fuck, if it was her\n\u2026\nBryce rose from the couch. \u201cI\u2019m going for a run.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s one in the morning.\u201d\n\u201cI need to run for a bit, or I won\u2019t be able to fall asleep.\u201d\nHunt shot to his feet. \u201cWe just came from the scene of a murder, and\nSabine was out for your blood, Bryce\u2014\u201d\nShe aimed for her bedroom and didn\u2019t look back.\nShe emerged two minutes later in her exercise clothes and found him\nstanding by the door in workout gear of his own. She frowned. \u201cI want to\nrun alone.\u201d\nHunt opened the door and stepped into the hall. \u201cToo fucking bad.\u201d\nThere was her breathing, and the pounding of her feet on the slick streets,\nand the blaring music in her ears. She\u2019d turned it up so loud it was mostly\njust noise. Deafening noise with a beat. She never played it this loud during\nher morning runs, but with Hunt keeping a steady pace beside her, she\ncould blast her music and not worry about some predator taking advantage\nof it.\nSo she ran. Down the broad avenues, the alleys, and side streets. Hunt\nmoved with her, every motion graceful and rippling with power. She could\nhave sworn lightning trailed in their wake.\nSabine. Had she killed Danika?\nBryce couldn\u2019t wrap her mind around it. Each breath was like shards\nof glass.\nThey needed to catch her in the act. Find evidence against her.\nHer leg began to ache, an acidic burn along her upper thighbone. She\nignored it.\nBryce cut toward Asphodel Meadows, the route so familiar that she\nwas surprised her footprints hadn\u2019t been worn into the cobblestones. She\nrounded a corner sharply, biting down on the groan of pain as her leg\nobjected. Hunt\u2019s gaze snapped to her, but she didn\u2019t look at him.\nSabine. Sabine. Sabine.\nHer leg burned, but she kept going. Through the Meadows. Through\nFiRo.\nKept running. Kept breathing. She didn\u2019t dare stop.\nBryce knew Hunt was making a concerted effort to keep his mouth shut\nwhen they finally returned to her apartment an hour later. She had to grip\nthe doorway to keep upright.\nHis eyes narrowed, but he said nothing. He didn\u2019t mention that her\nlimp had been so bad she\u2019d barely been able to run the last ten blocks.\nBryce knew the limp and pain would be worse by morning. Each step drew\na cry to her throat that she swallowed down and down and down.\n\u201cAll right?\u201d he asked tightly, lifting his shirt to wipe the sweat from his\nface. She had a too-brief glimpse of those ridiculous stomach muscles,\ngleaming with sweat. He\u2019d stayed by her side the entire time\u2014hadn\u2019t\ncomplained or spoken. Had just kept pace.\nBryce made a point not to lean on the wall as she walked toward her\nbedroom.\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said breathlessly. \u201cJust needed to run it out.\u201d\nHe reached for her leg, a muscle ticking in his jaw. \u201cThat happen\noften?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d she lied.\nHunt just gave her a look.\nShe couldn\u2019t stop her next limping step. \u201cSometimes,\u201d she amended,\nwincing. \u201cI\u2019ll ice it. It\u2019ll be fine by morning.\u201d If she\u2019d been full-blooded\nFae, it would have healed in an hour or two. Then again, if she were full-\nblooded Fae, the injury wouldn\u2019t have lingered like this.\nHis voice was hoarse as he asked, \u201cYou ever get it checked out?\u201d\n\u201cYep,\u201d she lied again, and rubbed at her sweaty neck. Before he could\ncall her on it, she said, \u201cThanks for coming.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Not quite an answer, but Hunt mercifully said nothing else as\nshe limped down the hallway and shut the door to her room."}, "39": {"Name": "PART III THE CANYON-Chapter 39", "Page Content": " 9 \nDespite its entrance facing the bustle of the Old Square, Ruhn found the\nmedwitch clinic blissfully quiet. The white-painted walls of the waiting\nroom glowed with the sunshine leaking through the windows that looked\nonto the semipermanent traffic, and the trickle of a small quartz fountain\natop the white marble counter blended pleasantly with the symphony\nplaying through the ceiling\u2019s speakers.\nHe\u2019d been waiting for five minutes now, while the witch he\u2019d come to\nsee finished up with a patient, and had been perfectly content to bask in the\ntendrils of lavender-scented steam from the diffuser on the small table\nbeside his chair. Even his shadows slumbered inside him.\nMagazines and pamphlets had been spread across the white oak coffee\ntable before him, the latter advertising everything from fertility treatments\nto scar therapy to arthritis relief.\nA door down the narrow hallway beyond the counter opened, and a\ndark head of softly curling hair emerged, a musical voice saying, \u201cPlease do\ncall if you have any further symptoms.\u201d The door clicked shut, presumably\nto give the patient privacy.\nRuhn stood, feeling out of place in his head-to-toe black clothes in the\nmidst of the soft whites and creams of the clinic, and kept himself perfectly\nstill as the medwitch approached the counter.\nAt the crime scene last night, he\u2019d gone over to inquire as to whether\nshe\u2019d noted anything interesting about the corpse. He\u2019d been impressed\nenough by her clear-eyed intelligence that he\u2019d asked to stop by this\nmorning.\nThe medwitch smiled slightly as she reached the other side of the\ncounter, her dark eyes lighting with welcome.\nThen there was that. Her arresting face. Not the cultivated beauty of a\nmovie star or model\u2014no, this was beauty in its rawest form, from her large\nbrown eyes to her full mouth to her high cheekbones, all in near-perfect\nsymmetry. All radiating a cool serenity and awareness. He\u2019d been unable to\nstop looking at her, even with a splattered corpse behind them.\n\u201cGood morning, Prince.\u201d And there was that, too. Her fair, beautiful\nvoice. Fae were sensitive about sounds, thanks to their heightened hearing.\nThey could hear notes within notes, chords within chords. Ruhn had once\nnearly run from a date with a young nymph when her high-pitched giggling\nhad sounded more like a porpoise\u2019s squeal. And in bed \u2026 fuck, how many\npartners had he never called again not because the sex had been bad, but\nbecause the sounds they\u2019d made had been unbearable? Too many to count.\nRuhn offered the medwitch a smile. \u201cHi.\u201d He nodded toward the hall.\n\u201cI know you\u2019re busy, but I was hoping you could spare a few minutes to\nchat about this case I\u2019m working on.\u201d\nClad in loose navy pants and a white cotton shirt with quarter-length\nsleeves that brought out her glowing brown skin, the medwitch stood with\nan impressive level of stillness.\nThey were a strange, unique group, the witches. Though they looked\nlike humans, their considerable magic and long lives marked them as Vanir,\ntheir power mostly passed through the female line. All of them deemed\ncivitas. The power was inherited, from some ancient source that the witches\nclaimed was a three-faced goddess, but witches did pop up in non-magical\nfamilies every now and then. Their gifts were varied, from seers to warriors\nto potion-makers, but healers were the most visible in Crescent City. Their\nschooling was thorough and long enough that the young witch before him\nwas unusual. She had to be skilled to be already working in a clinic when\nshe couldn\u2019t have been a day over thirty.\n\u201cI have another patient coming soon,\u201d she said, glancing over his\nshoulder to the busy street beyond. \u201cBut I have lunch after that. Do you\nmind waiting half an hour?\u201d She gestured to the hall behind her, where\nsunlight leaked in through a glass door at its other end. \u201cWe have a\ncourtyard garden. The day is fine enough that you could wait out there.\u201d\nRuhn agreed, glancing to the nameplate on the counter. \u201cThank you,\nMiss Solomon.\u201d\nShe blinked, those thick, velvety lashes bobbing in surprise. \u201cOh\u2014I\nam not \u2026 This is my sister\u2019s clinic. She went on holiday, and asked me to\ncover for her while she\u2019s gone.\u201d She gestured again to the hallway, graceful\nas a queen.\nRuhn followed her down the hall, trying not to breathe in her\neucalyptus-and-lavender scent too deeply.\nDon\u2019t be a fucking creep.\nThe sunlight tangled in her thick night-dark hair as she reached the\ncourtyard door and shouldered it open, revealing a slate-covered patio\nsurrounded by terraced herb gardens. The day was indeed lovely, the river\nbreeze making the plants rustle and sway, spreading their soothing\nfragrances.\nShe pointed to a wrought-iron table and chairs set by a bed of mint.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be out shortly.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he said, and she didn\u2019t wait for him to take a seat before\ndisappearing inside.\nThe thirty minutes passed quickly, mostly thanks to a flurry of calls he\ngot from Dec and Flynn, along with a few of his Aux captains. By the time\nthe glass door opened again, he had just set down his phone, intending on\nenjoying a few minutes of sweet-smelling silence.\nHe shot to his feet at the sight of the heavy tray the witch bore, laden\nwith a steaming teapot, cups, and a plate of cheese, honey, and bread. \u201cI\nthought that if I\u2019m stopping for lunch, we might as well eat together,\u201d she\nsaid as Ruhn took the tray.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t need to bring me anything,\u201d he said, careful not to upset\nthe teapot as he set the tray on the table.\n\u201cIt was no trouble. I don\u2019t like to eat alone anyway.\u201d She took the seat\nacross from him, and began distributing the silverware.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s your accent from?\u201d She didn\u2019t speak with the fast-paced\ndiction of someone in this city, but rather like someone who selected each\nword carefully.\nShe spread some cheese onto a slice of bread. \u201cMy tutors were from an\nold part of Pelium\u2014by the Rhagan Sea. It rubbed off on me, I suppose.\u201d\nRuhn poured himself some of the tea, then filled her cup. \u201cAll of that\narea is old.\u201d\nHer brown eyes gleamed. \u201cIndeed.\u201d\nHe waited until she\u2019d taken a sip of tea before saying, \u201cI\u2019ve spoken\nabout this to a few other medwitches around town, but no one\u2019s been able to\ngive me an answer. I\u2019m fully aware that I might be grasping at straws here.\nBut before I say anything, I\u2019d like to ask for your \u2026 discretion.\u201d\nShe pulled a few grapes and dates onto her plate. \u201cYou may ask what\nyou wish. I will not speak a word of it.\u201d\nHe inhaled the scent of his tea\u2014peppermint and licorice and\nsomething else, a whisper of vanilla and something \u2026 woodsy. He leaned\nback in his chair. \u201cAll right. I know your time is limited, so I\u2019ll be direct:\ncan you think of any way a magical object that was broken might be\nrepaired when no one\u2014not witches, not the Fae, not the Asteri themselves\n\u2014has been able to fix it? A way it might be \u2026 healed?\u201d\nShe drizzled honey atop her cheese. \u201cWas the object made from magic,\nor was it an ordinary item that was imbued with power afterward?\u201d\n\u201cLegend says it was made with magic\u2014and could only be used with\nthe Starborn gifts.\u201d\n\u201cAh.\u201d Her clear eyes scanned him, noting his coloring. \u201cSo it is a Fae\nartifact.\u201d\n\u201cYes. From the First Wars.\u201d\n\u201cYou speak of Luna\u2019s Horn?\u201d None of the other witches had gotten to\nit so quickly.\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d he hedged, letting her see the truth in his eyes.\n\u201cMagic and the power of the seven holy stars could not repair it,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cAnd far wiser witches than I have looked at it and found it an\nimpossible task.\u201d\nDisappointment dropped in his stomach. \u201cI just figured that the\nmedwitches might have some idea how to heal it, considering your field of\nexpertise.\u201d\n\u201cI see why you might think that. This clinic is full of marvels that I did\nnot know existed\u2014that my tutors did not know existed. Lasers and cameras\nand machines that can peer inside your body in the same way my magic\ncan.\u201d Her eyes brightened with each word, and for the life of him, Ruhn\ncouldn\u2019t look away. \u201cAnd maybe \u2026\u201d She angled her head, staring into a\nswaying bed of lavender.\nRuhn kept his mouth shut, letting her think. His phone buzzed with an\nincoming message, and he quickly silenced it.\nThe witch went still. Her slender fingers contracted on the table. Just\none movement, one ripple of reaction, to suggest something had clicked in\nthat pretty head of hers. But she said nothing.\nWhen she met his stare again, her eyes were dark. Full of warning. \u201cIt\nis possible that with all the medical advancements today, someone might\nhave found a way to repair a broken object of power. To treat the artifact not\nas something inert, but as a living thing.\u201d\n\u201cSo, what\u2014they\u2019d use some sort of laser to repair it?\u201d\n\u201cA laser, a drug, a skin graft, a transplant \u2026 current research has\nopened many doors.\u201d\nShit. \u201cWould it ring any bells if I said the ancient Fae claimed the Horn\ncould only be repaired by light that was not light, magic that was not\nmagic? Does it sound like any modern tech?\u201d\n\u201cIn that, I will admit I am not as well-versed as my sisters. My\nknowledge of healing is rooted in our oldest ways.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he said, and rose from his chair. \u201cThanks for your\ntime.\u201d\nShe met his eyes with a surprising frankness. Utterly unafraid of or\nimpressed by him. \u201cI am certain you will do so already, but I\u2019d advise you\nto proceed with caution, Prince.\u201d\n\u201cI know. Thanks.\u201d He rubbed the back of his neck, bracing himself.\n\u201cDo you think your queen might have an answer?\u201d\nThe medwitch\u2019s head angled again, all that glorious hair spilling over\nher shoulder. \u201cMy \u2026 Oh.\u201d He could have sworn sorrow clouded her eyes.\n\u201cYou mean the new queen.\u201d\n\u201cHypaxia.\u201d Her name shimmered on his tongue. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about the\nloss of your old queen.\u201d\n\u201cSo am I,\u201d the witch said. For a moment, her shoulders seemed to\ncurve inward, her head bowing under a phantom weight. Hecuba had been\nbeloved by her people\u2014her loss would linger. The witch blew out a breath\nthrough her nose and straightened again, as if shaking off the mantle of\nsorrow. \u201cHypaxia has been in mourning for her mother. She will not receive\nvisitors until she makes her appearance at the Summit.\u201d She smiled slightly.\n\u201cPerhaps you can ask her yourself then.\u201d\nRuhn winced. On the one hand, at least he didn\u2019t have to go see the\nwoman his father wanted him to marry. \u201cUnfortunately, this case is pressing\nenough that it can\u2019t wait until the Summit.\u201d\n\u201cI will pray to Cthona that you find your answers elsewhere, then.\u201d\n\u201cHopefully she\u2019ll listen.\u201d He took a few steps toward the door.\n\u201cI hope to see you again, Prince,\u201d the medwitch said, returning to her\nlunch.\nThe words weren\u2019t a come-on, some not-so-subtle invitation. But even\nlater, as he sat in the Fae Archives researching medical breakthroughs, he\nstill pondered the tone and promise of her farewell.\nAnd realized he\u2019d never gotten her name."}, "40": {"Name": "PART III THE CANYON-Chapter 40", "Page Content": " 0 \nIt took Viktoria two days to find anything unusual on the city cameras and\nthe power grid. But when she did, she didn\u2019t call Hunt. No, she sent a\nmessenger.\n\u201cVik told me to get your ass to her office\u2014the one at the lab,\u201d Isaiah\nsaid by way of greeting as he landed on the roof of the gallery.\nLeaning against the doorway that led downstairs, Hunt sized up his\ncommander. Isaiah\u2019s usual glow had dimmed, and shadows lay beneath his\neyes. \u201cIt\u2019s that bad with Sandriel there?\u201d\nIsaiah folded in his wings. Tightly. \u201cMicah\u2019s keeping her in check, but\nI was up all night dealing with petrified people.\u201d\n\u201cSoldiers?\u201d\n\u201cSoldiers, staff, employees, nearby residents \u2026 She\u2019s rattled them.\u201d\nIsaiah shook his head. \u201cShe\u2019s keeping the timing of Pollux\u2019s arrival quiet,\ntoo, to put us all on edge. She knows what kind of fear he drags up.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe we\u2019ll get lucky and that piece of shit will stay in Pangera.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re never that lucky, are we?\u201d\n\u201cNo. We\u2019re not.\u201d Hunt let out a bitter laugh. \u201cThe Summit\u2019s still a\nmonth away.\u201d A month of enduring Sandriel\u2019s presence. \u201cI \u2026 If you need\nanything from me, let me know.\u201d\nIsaiah blinked, surveying Hunt from head to boot tip. It shouldn\u2019t have\nshamed him, that surprise on the commander\u2019s face at his offer. Isaiah\u2019s\ngaze shifted to the tiled roof beneath their matching boots, as if\ncontemplating what or who might be responsible for his turn toward the\naltruistic. But Isaiah just asked, \u201cDo you think Roga really turns her exes\nand enemies into animals?\u201d\nHaving observed the creatures in the small tanks throughout the\nlibrary, Hunt could only say, \u201cI hope not.\u201d Especially for the sake of the\nassistant who had been pretending she wasn\u2019t falling asleep at her desk\nwhen he\u2019d called to check in twenty minutes ago.\nSince Declan had dropped the bomb about Sabine, she\u2019d been broody.\nHunt had advised her to be cautious about going after the future Prime, and\nshe\u2019d seemed inclined to wait for Viktoria to find any hint of the demon\u2019s\npatterns\u2014any proof that Sabine was indeed using the power of the ley lines\nto summon it, since her own power levels weren\u2019t strong enough. Most\nshifters\u2019 powers weren\u2019t, though Danika had been an exception. Another\nreason for her mother\u2019s jealousy\u2014and motive.\nThey\u2019d heard nothing from Ruhn, only a message yesterday about\ndoing more research on the Horn. But if Vik had found something \u2026 Hunt\nasked, \u201cVik can\u2019t come here with the news?\u201d\n\u201cShe wanted to show you in person. And I doubt Jesiba will be pleased\nif Vik comes here.\u201d\n\u201cConsiderate of you.\u201d\nIsaiah shrugged. \u201cJesiba is assisting us\u2014we need her resources. It\u2019d be\nstupid to push her limits. I have no interest in seeing any of you turned into\npigs if we step on her toes too much.\u201d\nAnd there it was. The meaningful, too-long glance.\nHunt held up his hands with a grin. \u201cNo need to worry on my front.\u201d\n\u201cMicah will come down on you like a hammer if you jeopardize this.\u201d\n\u201cBryce already told Micah she wasn\u2019t interested.\u201d\n\u201cHe won\u2019t forget that anytime soon.\u201d Fuck, Hunt certainly knew that.\nThe kill Micah had ordered last week as punishment for Hunt and Bryce\nembarrassing him in the Comitium lobby \u2026 It had lingered. \u201cBut I don\u2019t\nmean that. I meant if we don\u2019t find out who\u2019s behind this, if it turns out\nyou\u2019re wrong about Sabine\u2014not only will your reduced sentence be off the\ntable, but Micah will find you responsible.\u201d\n\u201cOf course he will.\u201d Hunt\u2019s phone buzzed, and he pulled it from his\npocket.\nHe choked. Not just at the message from Bryce: The gallery roof isn\u2019t\na pigeon roost, you know, but what she\u2019d changed her contact name to,\npresumably when he\u2019d gone to the bathroom or showered or just left his\nphone on the coffee table: Bryce Rocks My Socks.\nAnd there, beneath the ridiculous name, she\u2019d added a photo to her\ncontact: the one she\u2019d snapped of herself in the phone store, grinning from\near to ear.\nHunt suppressed a growl of irritation and typed back, Shouldn\u2019t you be\nworking?\nBryce Rocks My Socks wrote back a second later, How can I work\nwhen you two are thumping around up there?\nHe wrote back, How\u2019d you get my password? She hadn\u2019t needed it to\nactivate the camera feature, but to have gotten into his contacts, she would\nhave needed the seven-digit combination.\nI paid attention. She added a second later, And might have observed\nyou typing it in a few times while you were watching some dumb sunball\ngame.\nHunt rolled his eyes and pocketed his phone without replying. Well, at\nleast she was coming out of that quiet cloud she\u2019d been in for days.\nHe found Isaiah watching him carefully. \u201cThere are worse fates than\ndeath, you know.\u201d\nHunt looked toward the Comitium, the female Archangel lurking in it.\n\u201cI know.\u201d\nBryce frowned out the gallery door. \u201cThe forecast didn\u2019t call for rain.\u201d She\nscowled at the sky. \u201cSomeone must be throwing a tantrum.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s illegal to interfere with the weather,\u201d Hunt recited from beside\nher, thumbing a message into his phone. He hadn\u2019t changed the new contact\nname she\u2019d given herself, Bryce had noticed. Or erased that absurd photo\nshe\u2019d added to her contact listing.\nShe silently mimicked his words, then said, \u201cI don\u2019t have an\numbrella.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a far flight to the lab.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019d be easier to call a car.\u201d\n\u201cAt this hour? In the rain?\u201d He sent off his message and pocketed his\nphone. \u201cIt\u2019ll take you an hour just to cross Central Avenue.\u201d\nThe rain swept through the city in sheets. \u201cI could get electrocuted up\nthere.\u201d\nHunt\u2019s eyes glittered as he offered her a hand. \u201cGood thing I can keep\nyou safe.\u201d\nWith all that lightning in his veins, she supposed it was true.\nBryce sighed and frowned at her dress, the black suede heels that\nwould surely be ruined. \u201cI\u2019m not in flying-appropriate attire\u2014\u201d\nThe word ended on a yelp as Hunt hauled her into the sky.\nShe clung to him, hissing like a cat. \u201cWe have to go back before\nclosing for Syrinx.\u201d\nHunt soared over the congested, rain-battered streets as Vanir and\nhumans ducked into doorways and under awnings to escape the weather.\nThe only ones on the streets were those with umbrellas or magical shields\nup. Bryce buried her face against his chest, as if it\u2019d shield her from the rain\n\u2014and the terrible drop. What it amounted to was a face full of his scent and\nthe warmth of his body against her cheek.\n\u201cSlow down,\u201d she ordered, fingers digging into his shoulders and neck.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be a baby,\u201d he crooned in her ear, the richness of his voice\nskittering over every bone of her body. \u201cLook around, Quinlan. Enjoy the\nview.\u201d He added, \u201cI like the city in the rain.\u201d\nWhen she kept her head ducked against his chest, he gave her a\nsqueeze. \u201cCome on,\u201d he teased over the honking horns and splash of tires\nthrough puddles. He added, voice nearly a purr, \u201cI\u2019ll buy you a milkshake if\nyou do.\u201d\nHer toes curled in her shoes at the low, coaxing voice.\n\u201cOnly for ice cream,\u201d she muttered, earning a chuckle from him, and\ncracked open an eye. She forced the other one open, too. Clutching his\nshoulders nearly hard enough to pierce through to his skin, working against\nevery instinct that screamed for her body to lock up, she squinted through\nthe water lashing her face at the passing city.\nIn the rain, the marble buildings gleamed like they were made from\nmoonstone, the gray cobblestone streets appeared polished a silvery blue\nsplashed with the gold of the firstlight lamps. To her right, the Gates in the\nOld Square, Moonwood, and FiRo rose through the sprawl, like the humped\nspine of some twining beast breaking the surface of a lake, their crystal\ngleaming like melting ice. From this high, the avenues that linked them all\n\u2014the ley lines beneath them\u2014shot like spears through the city.\nThe wind rattled the palms, tossing the fronds to and fro, their hissing\nalmost drowning out the cranky honking of drivers now in a traffic\nstandstill. The whole city, in fact, seemed to have stopped for a moment\u2014\nexcept for them, swiftly passing above it all.\n\u201cNot so bad, huh?\u201d\nShe pinched Athalar\u2019s neck, and his answering laugh brushed over her\near. She might have pressed her body a little harder against the solid wall of\nhis. He might have tightened his grip, too. Just a bit.\nIn silence, they watched the buildings shift from ancient stone and\nbrick to sleek metal and glass. The cars turned fancier, too\u2014worn taxis\nexchanged for black sedans with tinted windows, uniformed drivers idling\nin the front seats while they waited in lines outside the towering high-rises.\nFewer people occupied the much-cleaner streets\u2014certainly there was no\nmusic or restaurants overflowing with food and drink and laughter. This\nwas a sanitized, orderly pocket of the city, where the point was not to look\naround, but to look up. High in the rain-veiled gloom that wreathed the\nupper portions of the buildings, lights and shimmering whorls of color\nstained the mists. A splotch of red gleamed to her left, and she didn\u2019t need\nto look to know it came from Redner Industries\u2019 headquarters. She hadn\u2019t\nseen or heard from Reid in the two years since Danika\u2019s murder\u2014he\u2019d\nnever even sent his condolences afterward. Even though Danika herself had\nworked part-time at the company. Prick.\nHunt steered for a solid concrete building that Bryce had tried to block\nfrom her memory, landing smoothly on a second-story balcony. Hunt was\nopening the glass doors, flashing some sort of entry ID into a scanner, when\nhe said to her, \u201cViktoria\u2019s a wraith.\u201d\nShe almost said I know, but only nodded, following him inside. She\nand Hunt had barely spoken about that night. About what she remembered.\nThe air-conditioning was on full blast, and she instantly wrapped her\narms around herself, teeth chattering at the shock of going from the storm\ninto crisp cold.\n\u201cWalk fast\u201d was the only help Hunt offered, wiping the rain off his\nface.\nA cramped elevator ride and two hallways later, Bryce found herself\nshivering in the doorway of a spacious office overlooking a small park.\nWatching as Hunt and Viktoria clasped hands over the wraith\u2019s curved\nglass desk.\nHunt gestured to her, \u201cBryce Quinlan, this is Viktoria Vargos.\u201d\nViktoria, to her credit, pretended to be meeting her for the first time.\nSo much of that night was a blur. But Bryce remembered the sanitized\nroom. Remembered Viktoria playing that recording.\nAt least Bryce could now appreciate the beauty before her: the dark\nhair and pale skin and stunning green eyes were all Pangeran heritage,\nspeaking of vineyards and carved marble palaces. But the grace with which\nViktoria moved \u2026 Viktoria must have been old as Hel to have that sort of\nfluid beauty. To be able to steer her body so smoothly.\nA halo had been tattooed on her brow as well. Bryce hid her surprise\u2014\nher memory had failed to provide that detail. She knew the sprites had\nfought in the angels\u2019 rebellion, but hadn\u2019t realized any other non-malakim\nhad marched under Shahar\u2019s Daystar banner.\nWarmth glowed in Viktoria\u2019s eyes as she purred, \u201cPleasure.\u201d\nSomehow, Athalar only looked better soaked with rain, his shirt\nclinging to every hard, sculpted muscle. Bryce was all too aware, as she\nextended a hand, of how her hair now lay flat on her head thanks to the rain,\nof the makeup that had probably smeared down her face.\nViktoria took Bryce\u2019s hand, her grip firm but friendly, and smiled.\nWinked.\nHunt grumbled, \u201cShe does that flirty smile with everyone, so don\u2019t\nbother being flattered.\u201d\nBryce settled into one of the twin black leather seats on the other side\nof the desk, batting her eyelashes at Hunt. \u201cDoes she do it for you, too?\u201d\nViktoria barked a laugh, the sound rich and lovely. \u201cYou earned that\none, Athalar.\u201d\nHunt scowled, dropping into another chair\u2014one with the back cut low,\nBryce realized, to accommodate anyone with wings.\n\u201cIsaiah said you found something,\u201d Hunt said, crossing an ankle over a\nknee.\n\u201cYes, though not quite what you requested.\u201d Viktoria came around the\ndesk and handed a file to Bryce. Hunt leaned in to peer over her shoulder.\nHis wing brushed against the back of Bryce\u2019s head, but he didn\u2019t remove it.\nBryce squinted at the grainy photo, the sole clawed foot in the lower\nright corner. \u201cIs that\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSpotted in Moonwood just last night. I was tracking temperature\nfluctuations around the main avenues like you said, and noticed a dip\u2014just\nfor two seconds.\u201d\n\u201cA summoning,\u201d Hunt said.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Viktoria said. \u201cThe camera only got this tiny image of the foot\n\u2014it mostly stayed out of sight. But it was just off a main avenue, like you\nsuspected. We have a few more grainy captures from other locations last\nnight, but those show it even less\u2014a talon, rather than this entire foot.\u201d\nThe photo was blurry, but there it was\u2014those shredding claws she\u2019d\nnever forget.\nIt was an effort not to touch her leg. To remember the clear teeth that\nhad ripped into it.\nBoth of them looked to her. Waiting. Bryce managed to say, \u201cThat\u2019s a\nkristallos demon.\u201d\nHunt\u2019s wing spread a little farther around her, but he said nothing.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t find temperature fluctuations from the night of every\nmurder,\u201d Vik said, face turning grim. \u201cBut I did find one from when\nMaximus Tertian died. Ten minutes and two blocks away from him. No\nvideo footage, but it was the same seventy-seven-degree dip, made in the\nspan of two seconds.\u201d\n\u201cDid it attack anyone last night?\u201d Bryce\u2019s voice had turned a bit distant\n\u2014even to her ears.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Viktoria said. \u201cNot as far as we know.\u201d\nHunt kept studying the image. \u201cDid the kristallos go anywhere\nspecific?\u201d\nViktoria handed over another document. It was a map of Moonwood,\nfull of sprawling parks and riverfront walkways, palatial villas and\ncomplexes for Vanir and a few wealthy humans, peppered with the best\nschools and many of the fanciest restaurants in town. In its heart: the Den.\nAbout six red dots surrounded it. The creature had crawled around its\ntowering walls. Right in the heart of Sabine\u2019s territory.\n\u201cBurning Solas,\u201d Bryce breathed, a chill slithering along her spine.\n\u201cIt would have found a way inside the Den\u2019s walls if what it hunts was\nthere,\u201d Hunt mused quietly. \u201cMaybe it was just following an old scent.\u201d\nBryce traced a finger between the various dots. \u201cNo bigger pattern,\nthough?\u201d\n\u201cI ran it through the system and nothing came up beyond what you two\nfigured out about the proximity to the ley lines beneath those roads and the\ntemperature dips.\u201d Viktoria sighed. \u201cIt seems like it was looking for\nsomething. Or someone.\u201d\nBlood and bone and gore, sprayed and shredded and in chunks\u2014\nGlass ripping into her feet; fangs ripping into her skin\u2014\nA warm, strong hand gently gripped her thigh. Squeezed once.\nBut when Bryce looked over at Hunt, his attention was upon Viktoria\n\u2014even as his hand remained upon her bare leg, his wing still slightly\ncurved around her. \u201cHow\u2019d you lose track of it?\u201d\n\u201cIt was simply there one moment, and gone the next.\u201d\nHunt\u2019s thumb stroked her leg, just above her knee. An idle, reassuring\ntouch.\nOne that was far too distracting as Viktoria leaned forward to tap\nanother spot on the map, her green eyes lifting from it only to note Hunt\u2019s\nhand as well. Wariness flooded her stare, but she said, \u201cThis was its last\nknown location, at least as far as what our cameras could find.\u201d The Rose\nGate in FiRo. Nowhere near Sabine\u2019s territory. \u201cAs I said, one moment it\nwas there, then it was gone. I\u2019ve had two different units and one Auxiliary\npack hunting for it all day, but no luck.\u201d\nHunt\u2019s hand slid from her leg, leaving a cold spot in its wake. A glance\nat his face and she saw the cause: Viktoria now held his gaze, her own full\nof warning.\nBryce tapped her dusky nails on the chrome arm of the chair.\nWell, at least she knew what they were doing after dinner tonight."}, "41": {"Name": "PART III THE CANYON-Chapter 41", "Page Content": " 1 \nThe rain didn\u2019t halt.\nHunt couldn\u2019t decide if it was a blessing, since it kept the streets\nmostly empty of all save Vanir affiliated with water, or if it was shit-poor\nluck, since it certainly wiped away any chance of a scent from the demon\nprowling the streets.\n\u201cCome \u2026 on,\u201d Bryce grunted.\nLeaning against the wall beside the front door of the gallery, sunset\nmere minutes away, Hunt debated pulling out his phone to film the scene\nbefore him: Syrinx with his claws embedded in the carpet, yowling his head\noff, and Bryce trying to haul him by the back legs toward the door.\n\u201cIt\u2019s. Just. Water!\u201d she gritted out, tugging again.\n\u201cEeettzzz!\u201d Syrinx wailed back.\nBryce had declared that they were dropping off Syrinx at her\napartment before going out to FiRo to investigate.\nShe grunted again, legs straining as she heaved the chimera. \u201cWe. Are.\nGoing. Home!\u201d\nThe green carpet began to lift, nails popping free as Syrinx clung for\ndear life.\nCthona spare him. Snickering, Hunt did Jesiba Roga a favor before\nSyrinx started on the wood panels, and wrapped a cool breeze around the\nchimera. Brow scrunching with concentration, he hoisted Syrinx from the\ncarpet, floating him on a storm-wind straight to Hunt\u2019s open arms.\nSyrinx blinked at him, then bristled, his tiny white teeth bared.\nHunt said calmly, \u201cNone of that, beastie.\u201d\nSyrinx harrumphed, then went boneless.\nHunt found Bryce blinking, too. He threw her a grin. \u201cAny more\nscreeching from you?\u201d\nShe grumbled, her words muffled by the rain-blasted night. Syrinx\ntensed in Hunt\u2019s arms as they emerged into the wet evening, Bryce shutting\nand locking the door behind them. She limped slightly. As if her tug-of-war\nwith the chimera had strained her thigh again.\nHunt kept his mouth shut as he handed Syrinx over to her, the chimera\npractically clawing holes in Bryce\u2019s dress. He knew her leg bothered her.\nKnew he\u2019d been the cause, with his battlefield stapling. But if she was\ngoing to be stupid and not get it looked at, then fine. Fine.\nHe didn\u2019t say any of that as Bryce wrapped her arms around Syrinx,\nhair already plastered to her head, and stepped closer to him. Hunt was\nkeenly aware of every part of his body that met every part of hers as he\nscooped her into his arms, flapped his wings, and shot them into the\nstorming skies, Syrinx huffing and hissing.\nSyrinx forgave them both by the time they stood, dripping water, in the\nkitchen, and Bryce earned redemption points for the additional food she\ndumped into his bowl.\nAn outfit change for Bryce into athletic gear, and thirty minutes later,\nthey stood in front of the Rose Gate. Its roses, wisteria, and countless other\nflowers gleamed with rain in the firstlight from lampposts flanking the\ntraffic circle beyond it. A few cars wound past to disperse either into the\ncity streets or along Central Avenue, which crossed through the Gate and\nbecame the long, dark expanse of the Eastern Road.\nHunt and Bryce squinted through the rain to peer at the square, the\nGate, the traffic circle.\nNo hint of the demon that had been creeping through Vik\u2019s feeds.\nFrom the corner of his eye, he watched Bryce rub her upper thigh,\nreining in her wince. He ground his teeth, but bit back his reprimand.\nHe didn\u2019t feel like getting another lecture on domineering alphahole\nbehavior.\n\u201cRight,\u201d Bryce said, the ends of her ponytail curling in the damp.\n\u201cSince you\u2019re the sicko with dozens of crime scene photos on your phone,\nI\u2019ll let you do the investigating.\u201d\n\u201cFunny.\u201d Hunt pulled out his phone, snapped a photo of her standing\nin the rain and looking pissy, and then pulled up a photo he\u2019d taken of the\nprintouts Vik had made.\nBryce pressed closer to study the photo on his phone, the heat of her\nbody a beckoning song. He kept perfectly still, refusing to heed it, as she\nlifted her head. \u201cThat camera there,\u201d she said, pointing to one of the ten\nmounted on the Gate itself. \u201cThat\u2019s the one that got the little blur.\u201d\nHunt nodded, surveying the Rose Gate and its surroundings. No sign\nof Sabine. Not that he expected the future Prime to be standing out in the\nopen, summoning demons like some city-square charlatan. Especially not in\nsuch a public place, usually packed with tourists.\nIn the centuries since the Fae had decided to cover their Gate with\nflowers and climbing plants, the Rose Gate had become one of the biggest\ntourist draws, with thousands of people flocking there each day to give a\ndrop of power to make a wish on its dial pad, nearly hidden beneath ivy,\nand to snap photos of the stunning little creatures who now made their nests\nand homes within the tangle of green. But at this hour, in this weather, even\nthe Rose Gate was quiet. Dark.\nBryce rubbed her gods-damned thigh again. He swallowed down his\nannoyance and asked, \u201cYou think the demon headed out of the city?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m praying it didn\u2019t.\u201d The broad Eastern Road speared into dark,\nrolling hills and cypresses. A few golden firstlights gleamed among them,\nthe only indication of the farms and villas interspersed throughout the\nvineyards, grazing lands, and olive groves. All good places to hide.\nBryce kept close as they crossed the street, into the heart of the small\npark in the center of the traffic circle. She scanned the rain-slick trees\naround them. \u201cAnything?\u201d\nHunt began to shake his head, but paused. He saw something on the\nother side of the marble circle on which the Gate stood. He took out his\nphone, the screen light bouncing off the strong planes of his face. \u201cMaybe\nwe were wrong. About the ley lines.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\nHe showed her the map of the city he\u2019d pulled up, running a finger\nover Ward Avenue. Then Central. Main. \u201cThe kristallos appeared near all\nthese streets. We thought it was because they were close to the ley lines. But\nwe forgot what lies right beneath the streets, allowing the demon to appear\nand vanish without anyone noticing. The perfect place for Sabine to\nsummon something and order it to move around the city.\u201d He pointed to the\nother side of the Gate. To a sewer grate.\nBryce groaned. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding.\u201d\n\u201cGods, it reeks,\u201d Bryce hissed over the rushing water below, pressing her\nface into her elbow as she knelt beside Hunt and peered into the open sewer.\n\u201cWhat the fuck.\u201d\nSoaked from the rain and kneeling in Ogenas knew what on the\nsidewalk, Hunt hid his smile as the beam of his flashlight skimmed over the\nslick bricks of the tunnel below in a careful sweep, then over the cloudy,\ndark river, surging thanks to the waterfalls of rain that poured in through the\ngrates. \u201cIt\u2019s a sewer,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat did you expect?\u201d\nShe flipped him off. \u201cYou\u2019re the warrior-investigator-whatever. Can\u2019t\nyou go down there and find some clues?\u201d\n\u201cYou really think Sabine left an easy trail like that?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe there are claw marks or whatever.\u201d She surveyed the ancient\nstone. Hunt didn\u2019t know why she bothered. There were claw marks and\nscratches everywhere. Likely from whatever lowlifes had dwelled and\nhunted down here for centuries.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t some crime-scene investigative drama, Quinlan. It\u2019s not\nthat easy.\u201d\n\u201cNo one likes a condescending asshole, Athalar.\u201d\nHis mouth curved upward. Bryce studied the gloom below, mouth\ntightening as if she\u2019d will the kristallos or Sabine to appear. He\u2019d already\nsent a message to Isaiah and Vik to get extra cameras on the Gate and the\nsewer grate, along with any others in the vicinity. If one so much as shifted\nan inch, they\u2019d know. He didn\u2019t dare ask them to follow Sabine. Not yet.\n\u201cWe should go down there,\u201d Bryce declared. \u201cMaybe we can pick up\nher scent.\u201d\nHe said carefully, \u201cYou haven\u2019t made the Drop.\u201d\n\u201cSpare me the protective bullshit.\u201d\nDark Hel, this woman. \u201cI\u2019m not going down there unless we have a\nfuck-ton more weapons.\u201d He only had two guns and a knife. \u201cDemon aside,\nif Sabine\u2019s down there \u2026\u201d He might outrank Sabine in terms of power, but\nwith the witches\u2019 spells hobbling most of his might through the halo\u2019s ink,\nhe had his proverbial hands tied.\nSo it\u2019d come down to brute strength, and while he had the advantage\nthere, too, Sabine was lethal. Motivated. And mean as an adder.\nBryce scowled. \u201cI can handle myself.\u201d After the shooting range, he\ncertainly knew that.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about you, sweetheart. It\u2019s about me not wanting to wind up\ndead.\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t you use your lightning-thing to protect us?\u201d\nHe suppressed another smile at lightning-thing, but he said, \u201cThere\u2019s\nwater down there. Adding lightning to the mix doesn\u2019t seem wise.\u201d\nShe cut him a glare. Hunt gave one right back.\nHunt had the feeling he\u2019d passed some test when she smiled slightly.\nAvoiding that little smile, Hunt scanned the river of filth running\nbelow. \u201cAll sewers lead to the Istros. Maybe the Many Waters folk have\nseen something.\u201d\nBryce\u2019s brows rose. \u201cWhy would they?\u201d\n\u201cA river\u2019s a good place to dump a corpse.\u201d\n\u201cThe demon left remains, though. It\u2014or Sabine\u2014doesn\u2019t seem to be\ninterested in hiding them. Not if she wants to do this as part of some\nscheme to jeopardize Micah\u2019s image.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s only a theory right now,\u201d Hunt countered. \u201cI have a Many\nWaters contact who might have intel.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s head to the docks, then. We\u2019ll be less likely to be noticed at\nnight anyway.\u201d\n\u201cBut twice as likely to encounter a predator searching for a meal. We\u2019ll\nwait until daylight.\u201d The gods knew they\u2019d already risked enough in coming\ndown here. Hunt placed the metal lid back on the sewer with a thud. He got\none look at her annoyed, dirty face and chuckled. Before he could\nreconsider, he said, \u201cI have fun with you, Quinlan. Despite how terrible this\ncase is, despite all of it, I haven\u2019t had fun like this in a while.\u201d In ever.\nHe could have sworn she blushed. \u201cHang with me, Athalar,\u201d she said,\ntrying to wipe the grime off her legs and hands from kneeling at the grate\nentrance, \u201cand you might get rid of that stick up your ass after all.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t answer. There was just a click.\nShe whirled toward him to find his phone out. Snapping a photo of her.\nHunt\u2019s grin was a slash of white in the rainy gloom. \u201cI\u2019d rather have a\nstick up my ass than look like a drowned rat.\u201d\nBryce used the spigot on the roof to wash off her shoes, her hands. She had\nno desire to track the filth of the street into her house. She went so far as to\nmake Hunt take off his boots in the hallway, and didn\u2019t look to see if he was\nplanning on taking a shower before she ran for her own room and had the\nwater going in seconds.\nShe left her clothes in a pile in the corner, turned the heat as high as\nshe could tolerate, and began a process of scrubbing and foaming and\nscrubbing some more. Remembering how she\u2019d knelt on the filthy city\nstreet and breathed in a face full of sewer air, she scrubbed herself again.\nHunt knocked twenty minutes later. \u201cDon\u2019t forget to clean between\nyour toes.\u201d\nEven with the shut door, she covered herself. \u201cFuck off.\u201d\nHis chuckle rumbled to her over the sound of the water. He said, \u201cThe\nsoap in the guest room is out. Do you have another bar?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s some in the hall linen closet. Just take whatever.\u201d\nHe grunted his thanks, and was gone a heartbeat later. Bryce washed\nand lathered herself again. Gross. This city was so gross. The rain only\nmade it worse.\nThen Hunt knocked again. \u201cQuinlan.\u201d\nHis grave tone had her shutting off the water. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nShe whipped a towel around herself, sliding across the marble tiles as\nshe reached the door. Hunt was shirtless, leaning against the doorjamb to\nher bedroom. She might have ogled the muscles the guy was sporting if his\nface hadn\u2019t been serious as Hel. \u201cYou want to tell me something?\u201d\nShe gulped, scanning him from head to toe. \u201cAbout what?\u201d\n\u201cAbout what the fuck this is?\u201d He extended his hand. Opened up his\nbig fist.\nA purple glittery unicorn lay in it.\nShe snatched the toy from his hand. His dark eyes lit with amusement\nas Bryce demanded, \u201cWhy are you snooping through my things?\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you have a box of unicorns in your linen closet?\u201d\n\u201cThis one is a unicorn-pegasus.\u201d She stroked the lilac mane. \u201cJelly\nJubilee.\u201d\nHe just stared at her. Bryce shoved past him into the hall, where the\nlinen closet door was still ajar, her box of toys now on one of the lower\nshelves. Hunt followed a step behind. Still shirtless.\n\u201cThe soap is right there,\u201d she said, pointing to the stack directly at his\neye level. \u201cAnd yet you took down a box from the highest shelf?\u201d\nShe could have sworn color stained his cheeks. \u201cI saw purple glitter.\u201d\nShe blinked at him. \u201cYou thought it was a sex toy, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\nHe said nothing.\n\u201cYou think I keep my vibrator in my linen closet?\u201d\nHe crossed his arms. \u201cWhat I want to know is why you have a box of\nthese things.\u201d\n\u201cBecause I love them.\u201d She gently set Jelly Jubilee in the box, but\npulled out an orange-and-yellow toy. \u201cThis is my pegasus, Peaches and\nDreams.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re twenty-five years old.\u201d\n\u201cAnd? They\u2019re sparkly and squishy.\u201d She gave P&D a little squeeze,\nthen put her back in the box and pulled out the third one, a slender-legged\nunicorn with a mint-green coat and rose-colored mane. \u201cAnd this is\nPrincess Creampuff.\u201d She almost laughed at the juxtaposition as she held up\nthe sparkly toy in front of the Umbra Mortis.\n\u201cThat name doesn\u2019t even match her coloring. What\u2019s up with the food\nnames?\u201d\nShe ran a finger over the purple glitter sprayed across the doll\u2019s flank.\n\u201cIt\u2019s because they\u2019re so cute you could eat them. Which I did when I was\nsix.\u201d\nHis mouth twitched. \u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cHer name was Pineapple Shimmer and her legs were all squishy and\nglittery and I couldn\u2019t resist anymore and just \u2026 took a bite. Turns out the\ninside of them really is jelly. But not the edible kind. My mom had to call\npoison control.\u201d\nHe surveyed the box. \u201cAnd you still have these because \u2026?\u201d\n\u201cBecause they make me happy.\u201d At his still-bemused look she added,\n\u201cAll right. If you want to get deep about it, Athalar, playing with them was\nthe first time the other kids didn\u2019t treat me like a total freak. The Starlight\nFancy horses were the number one toy on every girl\u2019s Winter Solstice wish\nlist when I was five. And they were not all made equal. Poor Princess\nCreampuff here was common as a hoptoad. But Jelly Jubilee \u2026\u201d She\nsmiled at the purple unicorn-pegasus, the memory it summoned. \u201cMy mom\nleft Nidaros for the first time in years to buy her from one of the big towns\ntwo hours away. She was the ultimate Starlight Fancy conquest. Not just a\nunicorn, not just a pegasus\u2014but both. I flashed this baby at school and was\ninstantly accepted.\u201d\nHis eyes shone as she gently set the box on the high shelf. \u201cI\u2019ll never\nlaugh at them again.\u201d\n\u201cGood.\u201d She turned back to him, remembering that she still wore only\nher towel, and he was still shirtless. She grabbed a box of soap and shoved\nit toward him. \u201cHere. Next time you want to check out my vibrators, just\nask, Athalar.\u201d She inclined her head toward her bedroom door and winked.\n\u201cThey\u2019re in the left nightstand.\u201d\nAgain, his cheeks reddened. \u201cI wasn\u2019t\u2014you\u2019re a pain in the ass, you\nknow that?\u201d\nShe shut the linen closet door with her hip and sauntered back to her\nbedroom. \u201cI\u2019d rather be a pain in the ass,\u201d she said slyly over her bare\nshoulder, \u201cthan a snooping pervert.\u201d\nHis snarl followed her all the way back into the bathroom."}, "42": {"Name": "PART III THE CANYON-Chapter 42", "Page Content": " 2 \nIn the midmorning light, the Istros River gleamed a deep blue, its waters\nclear enough to see the detritus sprinkled among the pale rocks and waving\ngrasses. Centuries of Crescent City artifacts rusted away down there, picked\nover again and again by the various creatures who eked out a living by\nscavenging the crap hurled into the river.\nRumor had it that city officials had once tried to institute heavy fines\nfor anyone caught dumping things in the river, but the scavengers had\ncaught wind of it and put up such a fuss that the River Queen had no choice\nbut to shut the bill down when it was officially proposed.\nOverhead, angels, witches, and winged shifters soared by, keeping\nclear of the misty gloom of the Bone Quarter. Last night\u2019s rain had cleared\nto a pleasant spring day\u2014no hint of the flickering lights that often drifted\nbeneath the river\u2019s surface, visible only once night fell.\nBryce frowned down at a crustacean\u2014some type of mammoth blue\ncrab\u2014picking its way along the floor beside the quay\u2019s stone block, sorting\nthrough a pile of beer bottles. The remnants of last night\u2019s drunken revels.\n\u201cHave you ever been down to the mer-city?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Hunt rustled his wings, one brushing against her shoulder.\n\u201cHappy to stay above the surface.\u201d The river breeze drifted past, chill\ndespite the warm day. \u201cYou?\u201d\nShe rubbed her hands down her arms along the smooth leather of\nDanika\u2019s old jacket, trying to coax some warmth into them. \u201cNever got an\ninvite.\u201d\nMost never would. The river folk were notoriously secretive, their city\nbeneath the surface\u2014the Blue Court\u2014a place few who dwelled on land\nwould ever see. One glass sub went in and out per day, and those on it\ntraveled by invitation only. And even if they possessed the lung capacity or\nartificial means, no one was stupid enough to swim down. Not with what\nprowled these waters.\nAn auburn head of hair broke the surface a couple hundred yards out,\nand a partially scaled, muscled arm waved before vanishing, fingers tipped\nin sharp gray nails glinting in the sun.\nHunt glanced to Bryce. \u201cDo you know any mer?\u201d\nBryce lifted a corner of her mouth. \u201cOne lived down the hall my\nfreshman year at CCU. She partied harder than all of us combined.\u201d\nThe mer could shift into fully human bodies for short periods of time,\nbut if they went too long, the shift would be permanent, their scales drying\nup and flaking away into dust, their gills shrinking to nothing. The mer\ndown the hall had been granted an oversize tub in her dorm room so she\ndidn\u2019t need to interrupt her studies to return to the Istros once a day.\nBy the end of the first month of school, the mer had turned it into a\nparty suite. Parties that Bryce and Danika gleefully attended, Connor and\nThorne in tow. At the end of that year, their entire floor had been so\nwrecked that every one of them was slapped with a hefty fine for damages.\nBryce made sure she intercepted the letter before her parents got it out\nof the mailbox and quietly paid the fine with the marks she earned that\nsummer scooping ice cream at the town parlor.\nSabine had gotten the letter, paid the fine, and made Danika spend the\nwhole summer picking up trash in the Meadows.\nAct like trash, Sabine had told her daughter, and you can spend your\ndays with it.\nNaturally, the following fall, Bryce and Danika had dressed as trash\ncans for the Autumnal Equinox.\nThe water of the Istros was clear enough for Bryce and Hunt to see the\npowerful male body swim closer, the reddish-brown scales of his long tail\ncatching the light like burnished copper. Black stripes slashed through\nthem, the pattern continuing up his torso and along his arms. Like some sort\nof aquatic tiger. The bare skin of his upper arms and chest was heavily\ntanned, suggesting hours spent near the surface or basking on the rocks of\nsome hidden cove along the coast.\nThe male\u2019s head broke the water, and his taloned hands brushed back\nhis jaw-length auburn hair as he flashed Hunt a grin. \u201cLong time no see.\u201d\nHunt smiled at the mer male treading water. \u201cGlad you weren\u2019t too busy\nwith your fancy new title to say hello.\u201d\nThe mer waved a hand in dismissal, and Hunt beckoned Bryce\nforward. \u201cBryce, this is Tharion Ketos.\u201d She stepped closer to the concrete\nedge of the quay. \u201cAn old friend.\u201d\nTharion grinned at Hunt again. \u201cNot as old as you.\u201d\nBryce gave the male a half smile. \u201cNice to meet you.\u201d\nTharion\u2019s light brown eyes glittered. \u201cThe pleasure, Bryce, is all\nmine.\u201d\nGods spare him. Hunt cleared his throat. \u201cWe\u2019re here on official\nbusiness.\u201d\nTharion swam the remaining few feet to the quay\u2019s edge, knocking the\ncrustacean into the drifting blue with a careless brush of his tail. Planting\nhis talon-tipped hands on the concrete, he easily heaved his massive body\nfrom the water, the gills beneath his ears sealing in as he switched control of\nhis breathing to his nose and mouth. He patted the now-wet concrete next to\nhim and winked at Bryce. \u201cTake a seat, Legs, and tell me all about it.\u201d\nBryce huffed a laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re trouble.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s my middle name, actually.\u201d\nHunt rolled his eyes. But Bryce sat beside the male, apparently not\ncaring that the water would surely soak into the green dress she wore\nbeneath the leather jacket. She pulled off her beige heels and dipped her feet\nin the water, splashing softly. Normally, he\u2019d have dragged her away from\nthe river\u2019s edge, and told her she\u2019d be lucky to lose just the leg if she put a\nfoot in the water. But with Tharion beside them, none of the river\u2019s\ndenizens would dare approach.\nTharion asked Bryce, \u201cAre you in the 33rd or the Auxiliary?\u201d\n\u201cNeither. I\u2019m working with Hunt as a consultant on a case.\u201d\nTharion hummed. \u201cWhat does your boyfriend think of you working\nwith the famed Umbra Mortis?\u201d\nHunt sat down on the male\u2019s other side. \u201cReal subtle, Tharion.\u201d\nYet Bryce\u2019s mouth bloomed into a full smile.\nIt was a near-twin to the one she\u2019d given him this morning, when he\u2019d\npopped his head into her room to see if she was ready to leave. Of course,\nhis eyes had gone directly to the left nightstand. And then that smile had\nturned feral, like she knew exactly what he was wondering about.\nHe certainly had not been looking for any of her sex toys when he\u2019d\nopened up the linen closet last night. But he\u2019d spied a flash of purple\nsparkles, and\u2014fine, maybe the thought had crossed his mind\u2014he\u2019d just\npulled down the box before he could really think.\nAnd now that he knew where they were, he couldn\u2019t help but look at\nthat nightstand and imagine her there, in that bed. Leaning against the\npillows and\u2014\nIt might have made sleeping a shade uncomfortable last night.\nTharion leaned back on his hands, displaying his muscled abdomen as\nhe asked innocently, \u201cWhat did I say?\u201d\nBryce laughed, making no attempt to hide her blatant ogling of the\nmer\u2019s cut body. \u201cI don\u2019t have a boyfriend. You want the job?\u201d\nTharion smirked. \u201cYou like to swim?\u201d\nAnd that was about as much as Hunt could take with only one cup of\ncoffee in his system. \u201cI know you\u2019re busy, Tharion,\u201d he said through his\nteeth with just enough edge that the mer peeled his attention away from\nBryce, \u201cso we\u2019ll keep this quick.\u201d\n\u201cOh, take your time,\u201d Tharion said, eyes dancing with pure male\nchallenge. \u201cThe River Queen gave me the morning off, so I\u2019m all yours.\u201d\n\u201cYou work for the River Queen?\u201d Bryce asked.\n\u201cI\u2019m a lowly peon in her court, but yes.\u201d\nHunt leaned forward to catch Bryce\u2019s stare. \u201cTharion\u2019s just been\npromoted to her Captain of Intelligence. Don\u2019t let the charm and irreverence\nfool you.\u201d\n\u201cCharm and irreverence happen to be my two favorite traits,\u201d Bryce\nsaid with a wink for Tharion this time.\nThe mer\u2019s smile deepened. \u201cCareful, Bryce. I might decide I like you\nand bring you Beneath.\u201d\nHunt gave Tharion a warning look. Some of the darker mer had done\njust that, long ago. Carried human brides down to their undersea courts and\nkept them there, trapped within the massive air bubbles that contained parts\nof their palaces and cities, unable to reach the surface.\nBryce waved off the awful history. \u201cWe have a few questions for you,\nif that\u2019s all right.\u201d\nTharion gestured lazily with a claw-tipped, webbed hand. The\nmarkings on the mer were varied and vibrant: different coloring, stripes or\nspecks or solids, their tails long-finned or short or wispy. Their magic\nmostly involved the element in which they lived, though some could\nsummon tempests. The River Queen, part mer, part river-spirit, could\nsummon far worse, they said. Possibly wash away all of Lunathion, if\nprovoked.\nShe was a daughter of Ogenas, according to legend, born from the\nmighty river-that-encircles-the-world, and sister to the Ocean Queen, the\nreclusive ruler of the five great seas of Midgard. There was a fifty-fifty\nchance the goddess thing was true of the River Queen, Hunt supposed. But\nregardless, the residents of this city did their best not to piss her off. Even\nMicah maintained a healthy, respectful relationship with her.\nHunt asked, \u201cYou see anything unusual lately?\u201d\nTharion\u2019s tail idly stirred the sparkling water. \u201cWhat kind of case is\nthis? Murder?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Hunt said. Bryce\u2019s face tightened.\nTharion\u2019s claws clicked on the concrete. \u201cSerial killer?\u201d\n\u201cJust answer the question, asshole.\u201d\nTharion peered at Bryce. \u201cIf he talks to you like that, I hope you kick\nhim in the balls.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019d enjoy it,\u201d Hunt muttered.\n\u201cHunt has learned his lesson about pissing me off,\u201d Bryce said sweetly.\nTharion\u2019s smile was sly. \u201cThat is a story I\u2019d like to hear.\u201d\n\u201cOf course you would,\u201d Hunt grumbled.\n\u201cDoes this have to do with the Viper Queen pulling in her people the\nother week?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Hunt said carefully.\nTharion\u2019s eyes darkened, a reminder that the male could be lethal\nwhen the mood struck him, and that there was a good reason the creatures\nof the river didn\u2019t fuck with the mer. \u201cSome bad shit\u2019s going down, isn\u2019t it.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to stop it,\u201d Hunt said.\nThe mer nodded gravely. \u201cLet me ask around.\u201d\n\u201cCovertly, Tharion. The less people who know something\u2019s happening\nthe better.\u201d\nTharion slipped back into the water, again disturbing the poor crab\nwho\u2019d clawed his way back to the quay. The mer\u2019s powerful tail thrashed,\nkeeping him effortlessly in place as he surveyed Hunt and Bryce. \u201cDo I tell\nmy queen to pull in our people, too?\u201d\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t fit the pattern so far,\u201d Hunt said, \u201cbut it wouldn\u2019t hurt to give\na warning.\u201d\n\u201cWhat should I be warning her about?\u201d\n\u201cAn old-school demon called the kristallos,\u201d Bryce said softly. \u201cA\nmonster straight from the Pit, bred by the Star-Eater himself.\u201d\nFor a moment, Tharion said nothing, his tan face going pale. Then,\n\u201cFuck.\u201d He ran a hand through his wet hair. \u201cI\u2019ll ask around,\u201d he promised\nagain. Far down the river, motion drew Hunt\u2019s eye. A black boat drifted\ntoward the mist of the Bone Quarter.\nOn the Black Dock, jutting from the city\u2019s bright shoreline like a dark\nsword, a group of mourners huddled beneath the inky arches, praying for\nthe boat to safely bear the veiled pine coffin across the water.\nAround the wooden vessel, broad, scaled backs broke the river\u2019s\nsurface, writhing and circling. Waiting for final judgment\u2014and lunch.\nTharion followed his line of sight. \u201cFive marks says it tips.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s disgusting,\u201d Bryce hissed.\nTharion swished his tail, playfully splashing Bryce\u2019s legs with water.\n\u201cI won\u2019t bet on your Sailing, Legs. I promise.\u201d He flicked some water\ntoward Hunt. \u201cAnd we already know your boat is going to tip right the fuck\nover before it\u2019s even left the shore.\u201d\n\u201cFunny.\u201d\nBehind them, an otter in a reflective yellow vest loped past, a sealed\nwax message tube held in its fanged mouth. It barely glanced their way\nbefore leaping into the river and vanishing. Bryce bit her lip, a high-pitched\nsqueal cracking from her.\nThe fearless, fuzzy messengers were hard to resist, even for Hunt.\nWhile true animals and not shifters, they possessed an uncanny level of\nintelligence, thanks to the old magic in their veins. They\u2019d found their place\nin the city by relaying tech-free communication between those who lived in\nthe three realms that made up Crescent City: the mer in the river, the\nReapers in the Bone Quarter, and the residents of Lunathion proper.\nTharion laughed at the naked delight on Bryce\u2019s face. \u201cDo you think\nthe Reapers fall to pieces over them, too?\u201d\n\u201cI bet even the Under-King himself squeals when he sees them,\u201d Bryce\nsaid. \u201cThey were part of why I wanted to move here in the first place.\u201d\nHunt lifted a brow. \u201cReally?\u201d\n\u201cI saw them when I was a kid and thought they were the most magical\nthing I\u2019d ever seen.\u201d She beamed. \u201cI still do.\u201d\n\u201cConsidering your line of work, that\u2019s saying something.\u201d\nTharion angled his head at them. \u201cWhat manner of work is that?\u201d\n\u201cAntiquities,\u201d Bryce said. \u201cIf you ever find anything interesting in the\ndepths, let me know.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll send an otter right to you.\u201d\nHunt got to his feet, offering a hand to help Bryce rise. \u201cKeep us\nposted.\u201d\nTharion gave him an irreverent salute. \u201cI\u2019ll see you when I see you,\u201d\nhe said, gills flaring, and dove beneath the surface. They watched him swim\nout toward the deep heart of the river, following the same path as the otter,\nthen plunge down, down\u2014to those distant, twinkling lights.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a charmer,\u201d Bryce murmured as Hunt hauled her to her feet, his\nother hand coming to her elbow.\nHunt\u2019s hand lingered, the heat of it searing her even through the leather\nof the jacket. \u201cJust wait until you see him in his human form. He causes\nriots.\u201d\nShe laughed. \u201cHow\u2019d you even meet him?\u201d\n\u201cWe had a string of mer murders last year.\u201d Her eyes darkened in\nrecognition. It\u2019d been all over the news. \u201cTharion\u2019s little sister was one of\nthe victims. It was high-profile enough that Micah assigned me to help out.\nTharion and I worked on the case together for the few weeks it lasted.\u201d\nMicah had traded him three whole debts for it.\nShe winced. \u201cIt was you two who caught the killer? They never said on\nthe news\u2014just that he\u2019d been apprehended. Nothing more\u2014not even who it\nwas.\u201d\nHunt let go of her elbow. \u201cWe did. A rogue panther shifter. I handed\nhim over to Tharion.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m assuming the panther didn\u2019t make it down to the Blue Court.\u201d\nHunt surveyed the shimmering expanse of water. \u201cNo, he didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cIs Bryce being nice to you, Athie?\u201d\nSeated at the front desk of the gallery showroom, Bryce muttered, \u201cOh\nplease,\u201d and kept clicking through the paperwork Jesiba had sent over.\nHunt, sprawled in the chair across the desk from her, the portrait of\nangelic arrogance, merely asked the fire sprite lurking in the open iron door,\n\u201cWhat would you do if I said she wasn\u2019t, Lehabah?\u201d\nLehabah floated in the archway, not daring to come into the\nshowroom. Not when Jesiba would likely see. \u201cI\u2019d burn all her lunches for a\nmonth.\u201d\nHunt chuckled, the sound sliding along her bones. Bryce, despite\nherself, smiled.\nSomething heavy thumped, audible even a level above the library, and\nLehabah zoomed down the stairs, hissing, \u201cBad!\u201d\nBryce looked at Hunt as he sifted through the photos of the demon\nfrom a few nights ago. His hair hung over his brow, the sable strands\ngleaming like black silk. Her fingers curled on the keyboard.\nHunt lifted his head. \u201cWe need more intel on Sabine. The fact that she\nswapped the footage of the Horn\u2019s theft from the temple is suspicious, and\nwhat she said in the observation room that night is pretty suspicious, too,\nbut they don\u2019t necessarily mean she\u2019s a murderer. I can\u2019t approach Micah\nwithout concrete proof.\u201d\nShe rubbed the back of her neck. \u201cRuhn hasn\u2019t gotten any leads on\nfinding the Horn, either, so that we can lure the kristallos.\u201d\nSilence fell. Hunt crossed an ankle over a knee, then stretched out a\nhand to where she\u2019d discarded Danika\u2019s jacket on the chair beside him, too\nlazy to bother hanging it. \u201cI saw Danika wearing this in the photo in your\nguest room. Why\u2019d you keep it?\u201d\nBryce let out a long breath, thankful for his shift in subject. \u201cDanika\nused to store her stuff in the supply closet here, rather than bothering to go\nback to the apartment or over to the Den. She\u2019d stashed the jacket here the\nday \u2026\u201d She blew out a breath and glanced toward the bathroom in the back\nof the space, where Danika had changed only hours before her death. \u201cI\ndidn\u2019t want Sabine to have it. She would have read the back of it and\nthrown it in the trash.\u201d\nHunt picked up the jacket and read, \u201cThrough love, all is possible.\u201d\nBryce nodded. \u201cThe tattoo on my back says the same thing. Well, in\nsome fancy alphabet that she dug up online, but \u2026 Danika had a thing\nabout that phrase. It was all the Oracle told her, apparently. Which makes no\nsense, because Danika was one of the least lovey-dovey people I\u2019ve ever\nmet, but \u2026\u201d Bryce toyed with the amulet around her neck, zipping it along\nthe chain. \u201cSomething about it resonated with her. So after she died, I kept\nthe jacket. And started wearing it.\u201d\nHunt carefully set the jacket back on the chair. \u201cI get it\u2014about the\npersonal effects.\u201d He seemed like he wasn\u2019t going to say more, but then he\ncontinued, \u201cThat sunball hat you made fun of?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t make fun of it. You just don\u2019t seem like the kind of male who\nwears such a thing.\u201d\nHe chuckled again\u2014in that same way that slid over her skin. \u201cThat hat\nwas the first thing I bought when I came here. With the first paycheck I ever\nreceived from Micah.\u201d The corner of his mouth turned upward. \u201cI saw it in\nan athletic shop, and it just seemed so ordinary. You have no idea how\ndifferent Lunathion is from the Eternal City. From anything in Pangera. And\nthat hat just \u2026\u201d\n\u201cRepresented that?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. It seemed like a new beginning. A step toward a more normal\nexistence. Well, as normal an existence as someone like me can have.\u201d\nShe made an effort not to look at his wrist. \u201cSo you have your hat\u2014\nand I have Jelly Jubilee.\u201d\nHis smile lit up the dimness of the gallery. \u201cI\u2019m surprised you don\u2019t\nhave a tattoo of Jelly Jubilee somewhere.\u201d His eyes skimmed over her,\nlingering on the short, tight green dress.\nHer toes curled. \u201cWho says I don\u2019t have a tattoo of her somewhere you\ncan\u2019t see, Athalar?\u201d\nShe watched him sort through everything he had already seen. Since\nhe\u2019d moved in, she\u2019d stopped parading about the apartment in her\nunderwear while getting dressed, but she knew he\u2019d spotted her through the\nwindow in the days before. Knew he realized there was a limited, very\nintimate, number of places where another tattoo might be hidden.\nShe could have sworn his voice dropped an octave or two as he asked,\n\u201cDo you?\u201d\nWith any other male, she would have said, Why don\u2019t you come find\nout?\nWith any other male, she would have already been on the other side of\nthe desk. Crawling into his lap. Unbuckling his belt. And then sinking down\nonto his cock, riding him until they were both moaning and breathless and\n\u2014\nShe made herself go back to her paperwork. \u201cThere are a few males\nwho can answer that question, if you\u2019re so curious.\u201d How her voice was so\nsteady, she had no idea.\nHunt\u2019s silence was palpable. She didn\u2019t dare look over her computer\nscreen.\nBut his eyes remained focused on her, burning her like a brand.\nHer heart thundered throughout her body. Dangerous, stupid, reckless\n\u2014\nHunt let out a long, tight breath. The chair he sat in groaned as he\nshifted in it, his wings rustling. She still didn\u2019t dare look. She honestly\ndidn\u2019t know what she\u2019d do if she looked.\nBut then Hunt said, his voice gravelly, \u201cWe need to focus on Sabine.\u201d\nHearing her name was like being doused with ice water.\nRight. Yes. Of course. Because hooking up with the Umbra Mortis\nwasn\u2019t a possibility. The reasons for that started with him pining for a lost\nlove and ended with the fact that he was owned by the gods-damned\nGovernor. With a million other obstacles in between.\nShe still couldn\u2019t look at him as Hunt asked, \u201cAny thoughts on how we\ncan get more intel on her? Even just a glimpse into her current state of\nmind?\u201d\nNeeding something to do with her hands, her too-warm body, Bryce\nprinted out, then signed and dated, the paperwork Jesiba had sent. \u201cWe can\u2019t\nbring in Sabine for formal questioning without making her aware that we\u2019re\nonto her,\u201d Bryce said, at last looking at Hunt.\nHis face was flushed, and his eyes \u2026 Fucking Solas, his black eyes\nglittered, wholly fixed on her face. Like he was thinking of touching her.\nTasting her.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he said roughly, running a hand through his hair. His eyes\nsettled, the dark fire in them banking. Thank the gods.\nAn idea dawned upon her, and Bryce said in a strangled voice, her\nstomach twisting with dread, \u201cSo I think we have to bring the questions to\nSabine.\u201d"}, "43": {"Name": "PART III THE CANYON-Chapter 43", "Page Content": " 3 \nThe wolves\u2019 Den in Moonwood occupied ten entire city blocks, a sprawling\nvilla built around a wild tangle of forest and grass that legend claimed had\ngrown there since before anyone had touched these lands. Through the iron\ngates built into the towering limestone arches, Bryce could see through to\nthe private park, where morning sunlight coaxed drowsy flowers into\nopening up for the day. Wolf pups bounded, pouncing on each other,\nchasing their tails, watched over by gray-muzzled elders whose brutal days\nin the Aux were long behind them.\nHer gut twisted, enough to make her grateful she\u2019d forgone breakfast.\nShe\u2019d barely slept last night, as she considered and reconsidered this plan.\nHunt had offered to do it himself, but she\u2019d refused. She had to come here\n\u2014had to step up. For Danika.\nIn his usual battle-suit, Hunt stood a step away, silent as he\u2019d been on\nthe walk over here. As if he knew she could barely keep her legs from\nshaking. She wished she\u2019d worn sneakers. The steep angle of her heels had\nirritated the wound in her thigh. Bryce clenched her jaw against the pain as\nthey stood before the Den.\nHunt kept his dark eyes fixed upon the four sentries stationed at the\ngates.\nThree females, one male. All in humanoid form, all in black, all armed\nwith guns and sheathed swords down their backs. A tattoo of an onyx rose\nwith three claw marks slashed through its petals adorned the sides of their\nnecks, marking them as members of the Black Rose Wolf Pack.\nHer stomach roiled at the hilts peeking over their armored shoulders.\nBut she pushed away the memory of a braid of silvery-blond hair streaked\nwith purple and pink, constantly snagging in the hilt of an ancient, priceless\nblade.\nThough young, the Pack of Devils had been revered, the most talented\nwolves in generations. Led by the most powerful Alpha to grace Midgard\u2019s\nsoil.\nThe Black Rose Pack was a far cry from that. A far fucking cry.\nTheir eyes lit with predatory delight as they spotted Bryce.\nHer mouth went dry. And turned positively arid as a fifth wolf\nappeared from the glass security vestibule to the left of the gate.\nThe Alpha\u2019s dark hair had been pulled into a tight braid, accentuating\nthe sharp angles of her face as she sneered toward Bryce and Hunt.\nAthalar\u2019s hand casually drifted to the knife at his thigh.\nBryce said as casually as she could, \u201cHi, Amelie.\u201d\nAmelie Ravenscroft bared her teeth. \u201cWhat the fuck do you want?\u201d\nHunt bared his teeth right back. \u201cWe\u2019re here to see the Prime.\u201d He\nflashed his legion badge, the gold twinkling in the sun. \u201cOn behalf of the\nGovernor.\u201d\nAmelie flicked her gold eyes to Hunt, over his tattooed halo. Over his\nhand on the knife and the SPQM she surely knew was tattooed on the other\nside of his wrist. Her lip curled. \u201cWell, at least you picked interesting\ncompany, Quinlan. Danika would have approved. Hel, you might have even\ndone him together.\u201d Amelie leaned a shoulder against the vestibule\u2019s side.\n\u201cYou used to do that, right? I heard about you guys and those two\ndaemonaki. Classic.\u201d\nBryce smiled blandly. \u201cIt was three daemonaki, actually.\u201d\n\u201cStupid slut,\u201d Amelie snarled.\n\u201cWatch it,\u201d Hunt growled back.\nAmelie\u2019s pack members lingered behind her, eyeing Hunt and keeping\nback. The benefit of hanging with the Umbra Mortis, apparently.\nAmelie laughed, a sound filled with loathing. Not merely hatred for\nher, Bryce realized. But for the angels. The Houses of Earth and Blood and\nSky and Breath were rivals on a good day, enemies on a bad one. \u201cOr what?\nYou\u2019ll use your lightning on me?\u201d she said to Hunt. \u201cIf you do, you\u2019ll be in\nsuch deep shit that your master will bury you alive in it.\u201d A little smile at\nthe tattoo across his brow.\nHunt went still. And as interesting as it would have been to finally see\nhow Hunt Athalar killed, they had a reason for being here. So Bryce said to\nthe pack leader, \u201cYou\u2019re a delight, Amelie Ravenscroft. Radio your boss\nthat we\u2019re here to see the Prime.\u201d She flicked her brows in emphasis of the\ndismissal she knew would make the Alpha see red.\n\u201cShut that mouth of yours,\u201d Amelie said, \u201cbefore I rip out your\ntongue.\u201d\nA brown-haired male wolf standing behind Amelie taunted, \u201cWhy\ndon\u2019t you go fuck someone in a bathroom again, Quinlan?\u201d\nShe blocked out every word. But Hunt huffed a laugh that promised\nbroken bones. \u201cI told you to watch it.\u201d\n\u201cGo ahead, angel,\u201d Amelie sneered. \u201cLet\u2019s see what you can do.\u201d\nBryce could barely move around the panic and dread pushing in, could\nbarely breathe, but Hunt said quietly, \u201cThere are six pups playing in sight of\nthis gate. You really want to expose them to the kind of fight we\u2019d have,\nAmelie?\u201d\nBryce blinked. Hunt didn\u2019t so much as glance her way as he continued\naddressing a seething Amelie. \u201cI\u2019m not going to beat the shit out of you in\nfront of children. So either you let us in, or we\u2019ll come back with a\nwarrant.\u201d His gaze didn\u2019t falter. \u201cI don\u2019t think Sabine Fendyr would be\nparticularly happy with Option B.\u201d\nAmelie held his stare, even as the others tensed. That haughty\narrogance had made Sabine tap her as Alpha of the Black Rose Pack, even\nover Ithan Holstrom, now Amelie\u2019s Second. But Sabine had wanted\nsomeone just like herself, regardless of Ithan\u2019s higher power ranking. And\nperhaps someone a little less Alpha, too\u2014so she\u2019d have them firmly under\nher claws.\nBryce waited for Amelie to call Hunt\u2019s bluff about the warrant. Waited\nfor a snide remark or the appearance of fangs.\nYet Amelie plucked the radio from her belt and said into it, \u201cGuests are\nhere for the Prime. Come get them.\u201d\nShe had once breezed through the doors beyond Amelie\u2019s dark head,\nhad spent hours playing with the pups in the grass and trees beyond it\nwhenever Danika had been given babysitting duty.\nShe shut out the memory of what it had been like\u2014to watch Danika\nplaying with the fuzzy pups or shrieking children, who had all worshipped\nthe ground she walked upon. Their future leader, their protector, who would\ntake the wolves to new heights.\nBryce\u2019s chest constricted to the point of pain. Hunt glanced her way\nthen, his brows rising.\nShe couldn\u2019t do this. Be here. Enter this place.\nAmelie smiled, as if realizing that. Scenting her dread and pain.\nAnd the sight of the fucking bitch standing there, where Danika had\nonce been \u2026 Red washed over Bryce\u2019s vision as she drawled, \u201cIt\u2019s good to\nsee that crime has gone down so much, if all you have to do with your day,\nAmelie, is play guard at the front door.\u201d\nAmelie smiled slowly. Footsteps sounded on the other side of the gate,\njust before they swung open, but Bryce didn\u2019t dare look. Not as Amelie\nsaid, \u201cYou know, sometimes I think I should thank you\u2014they say if Danika\nhadn\u2019t been so distracted by messaging you about your drunk bullshit, she\nmight have anticipated the attack. And then I wouldn\u2019t be where I am,\nwould I.\u201d\nBryce\u2019s nails cut into her palms. But her voice, thank the gods, was\nsteady as she said, \u201cDanika was a thousand times the wolf you are. No\nmatter where you are, you\u2019ll never be where she was.\u201d\nAmelie went white with rage, her nose crinkling, lips pulling back to\nexpose her now-lengthening teeth\u2014\n\u201cAmelie,\u201d a male voice growled from the shadows of the gate\narchway.\nOh gods. Bryce curled her fingers into fists to keep from shaking as\nshe looked toward the young male wolf.\nBut Ithan Holstrom\u2019s eyes darted between her and Amelie as he\napproached his Alpha. \u201cIt\u2019s not worth it.\u201d The unspoken words simmered in\nhis eyes. Bryce isn\u2019t worth it.\nAmelie snorted, turning back to the vestibule, a shorter, brown-haired\nfemale following her. The pack\u2019s Omega, if memory served. Amelie\nsneered over a shoulder to Bryce, \u201cGo back to the dumpster you crawled\nout of.\u201d\nThen she shut the door. Leaving Bryce standing before Connor\u2019s\nyounger brother.\nThere was nothing kind on Ithan\u2019s tan face. His golden-brown hair was\nlonger than the last time she\u2019d seen him, but he\u2019d been a sophomore playing\nsunball for CCU then.\nThis towering, muscled male before them had made the Drop. Had\nstepped into his brother\u2019s shoes and joined the pack that had replaced\nConnor\u2019s.\nA brush of Hunt\u2019s velvet-soft wings against her arm had her walking.\nEvery step toward the wolf ratcheted up her heartbeat.\n\u201cIthan,\u201d Bryce managed to say.\nConnor\u2019s younger brother said nothing as he turned toward the pillars\nflanking the walkway.\nShe was going to puke. All over everything: the limestone tiles, the\npale pillars, the glass doors that opened into the park in the center of the\nvilla.\nShe shouldn\u2019t have let Athalar come. Should have made him stay on\nthe roof somewhere so he couldn\u2019t witness the spectacular meltdown that\nshe was three seconds away from having.\nIthan Holstrom\u2019s steps were unhurried, his gray T-shirt pulling across\nthe considerable expanse of his muscled back. He\u2019d been a cocky twenty-\nyear-old when Connor died, a history major like Danika and the star of\nCCU\u2019s sunball team, rumored to be going pro as soon as his brother gave\nthe nod. He could have gone pro right after high school, but Connor, who\nhad raised Ithan since their parents had died five years earlier, had insisted\nthat a degree came first, sports second. Ithan, who had idolized Connor, had\nalways folded on it, despite Bronson\u2019s pleas with Connor to let the kid go\npro.\nConnor\u2019s Shadow, they\u2019d teased Ithan.\nHe\u2019d filled out since then. At last started truly resembling his older\nbrother\u2014even the shade of his golden-brown hair was like a spike through\nher chest.\nI\u2019m crazy about you. I don\u2019t want anyone else. I haven\u2019t for a long\nwhile.\nShe couldn\u2019t breathe. Couldn\u2019t stop seeing, hearing those words,\nfeeling the giant fucking rip in the space-time continuum where Connor\nshould have been, in a world where nothing bad could ever, ever happen\u2014\nIthan stopped before another set of glass doors. He opened one, the\nmuscles in his long arm rippling as he held it for them.\nHunt went first, no doubt scanning the space in the span of a blink.\nBryce managed to look up at Ithan as she passed.\nHis white teeth shone as he bared them at her.\nGone was the cocky boy she\u2019d teased; gone was the boy who\u2019d tried\nout flirting on her so he could use the techniques on Nathalie, who had\nlaughed when Ithan asked her out but told him to wait a few more years;\ngone was the boy who had relentlessly questioned Bryce about when she\u2019d\nfinally start dating his brother and wouldn\u2019t take never for an answer.\nA honed predator now stood in his place. Who had surely not forgotten\nthe leaked messages she\u2019d sent and received that horrible night. That she\u2019d\nbeen fucking some random in the club bathroom while Connor\u2014Connor,\nwho had just spilled his heart to her\u2014was slaughtered.\nBryce lowered her eyes, hating it, hating every second of this fucked-\nup visit.\nIthan smiled, as if savoring her shame.\nHe\u2019d dropped out of CCU after Connor had died. Quit playing sunball.\nShe only knew because she\u2019d caught a game on TV one night two months\nlater and the commentators had still been discussing it. No one, not his\ncoaches, not his friends, not his packmates, could convince him to return.\nHe\u2019d walked away from the sport and never looked back, apparently.\nShe hadn\u2019t seen him since the days right before the murders. Her last\nphoto of him was the one Danika had taken at his game, playing in the\nbackground. The one she\u2019d tortured herself with last night for hours while\nbracing herself for what the dawn would bring.\nBefore that, though, there had been hundreds of photos of the two of\nthem together. They still sat on her phone like a basket full of snakes,\nwaiting to bite if she so much as opened the lid.\nIthan\u2019s cruel smile didn\u2019t waver as he shut the door behind them. \u201cThe\nPrime\u2019s taking a nap. Sabine will meet with you.\u201d\nBryce glanced at Hunt, who gave her a shallow nod. Precisely as\nthey\u2019d planned.\nBryce was aware of Ithan\u2019s every breath at her back as they aimed for\nthe stairs that Bryce knew would take them up a level to Sabine\u2019s office.\nHunt seemed aware of Ithan, too, and let enough lightning wreathe his\nhands, his wrists, that the young wolf took a step away.\nAt least alphaholes were good for something.\nIthan didn\u2019t leave. No, it seemed he was to be their guard and silent\ntormentor for the duration of this miserable trip.\nBryce knew every step toward Sabine\u2019s office on the second level, but\nIthan led the way: up the sprawling limestone stairs marred with so many\nscratches and gouges no one bothered to fix them anymore; down the high-\nceilinged, bright hall whose windows overlooked the busy street outside;\nand finally to the worn wood door. Danika had grown up here\u2014and moved\nout as soon as she\u2019d gone to CCU. After graduation, she\u2019d stayed only\nduring formal wolf events and holidays.\nIthan\u2019s pace was leisurely. As if he could scent Bryce\u2019s misery, and\nwanted to make her endure it for every possible second.\nShe supposed she deserved it. Knew she deserved it.\nShe tried to block out the memory that flashed.\nThe twenty-one ignored calls from Ithan, all in the first few days\nfollowing the murder. The half-dozen audiomails. The first had been\nsobbing, panicked, left in the hours afterward. Is it true, Bryce? Are they\ndead?\nAnd then the messages had shifted to worry. Where are you? Are you\nokay? I called the major hospitals and you\u2019re not listed, but no one is\ntalking. Please call me.\nAnd then, by the end, that last audiomail from Ithan, nothing but razor-\nsharp coldness. The Legion inspectors showed me all the messages. Connor\npractically told you that he loved you, and you finally agreed to go out with\nhim, and then you fucked some stranger in the Raven bathroom? While he\nwas dying? Are you kidding me with this shit? Don\u2019t come to the Sailing\ntomorrow. You\u2019re not welcome there.\nShe\u2019d never written back, never sought him out. Hadn\u2019t been able to\nendure the thought of facing him. Seeing the grief and pain in his face.\nLoyalty was the most prized of all wolf traits. In their eyes, she and Connor\nhad been inevitable. Nearly mated. Just a question of time. Her hookups\nbefore that hadn\u2019t mattered, and neither had his, because nothing had been\ndeclared yet.\nUntil he\u2019d asked her out at last. And she had said yes. Had started\ndown that road.\nTo the wolves, she was Connor\u2019s, and he was hers.\nMessage me when you\u2019re home safe.\nHer chest tightened and tightened, the walls pushing in, squeezing\u2014\nShe forced herself to take a long breath. To inhale to the point where\nher ribs strained from holding it in. Then to exhale, pushing-pushing-\npushing, until she was heaving out the pure gut-shredding panic that burned\nthrough her whole body like acid.\nBryce wasn\u2019t a wolf. She didn\u2019t play by their rules of courtship. And\nshe\u2019d been stupid and scared of what agreeing to that date had meant, and\nDanika certainly didn\u2019t care one way or another if Bryce had some\nmeaningless hookup, but\u2014Bryce hadn\u2019t ever worked up the nerve to\nexplain to Ithan after she\u2019d seen and heard his messages.\nShe\u2019d kept them all. Listening to them was a solid central arc of her\nemotional death-spiral routine. The culmination of it, of course, being\nDanika\u2019s last, foolishly happy messages.\nIthan knocked on Sabine\u2019s door, letting it swing wide to reveal a sunny\nwhite office whose windows looked into the verdant greenery of the Den\u2019s\npark. Sabine sat at her desk, her corn-silk hair near-glowing in the light.\n\u201cYou have some nerve coming here.\u201d\nWords dried up in Bryce\u2019s throat as she took in the pale face, the\nslender hands interlaced on the oak desk, the narrow shoulders that belied\nher tremendous strength. Danika had been pure wildfire; her mother was\nsolid ice. And if Sabine had killed her, if Sabine had done this \u2026\nRoaring began in Bryce\u2019s head.\nHunt must have sensed it, scented it, because he stepped up to Bryce\u2019s\nside, Ithan lingering in the hall, and said, \u201cWe wanted to meet with the\nPrime.\u201d\nIrritation flickered in Sabine\u2019s eyes. \u201cAbout?\u201d\n\u201cAbout your daughter\u2019s murder.\u201d\n\u201cStay the fuck out of our business,\u201d Sabine barked, setting the glass on\nher table rattling. Bile burned Bryce\u2019s throat, and she focused on not\nscreaming or launching herself at the woman.\nHunt\u2019s wing brushed Bryce\u2019s back, a casual gesture to anyone\nwatching, but that warmth and softness steadied her. Danika. For Danika,\nshe\u2019d do this.\nSabine\u2019s eyes blazed. \u201cWhere the Hel is my sword?\u201d\nBryce refused to answer, to even snap that the sword was and would\nalways be Danika\u2019s, and said, \u201cWe have intel that suggests Danika was\nstationed at Luna\u2019s Temple the night the Horn was stolen. We need the\nPrime to confirm.\u201d Bryce kept her eyes on the carpet, the portrait of\nterrified, shameful submission, and let Sabine dig her own grave.\nSabine demanded, \u201cWhat the fuck does this have to do with her\ndeath?\u201d\nHunt said calmly, \u201cWe\u2019re putting together a picture of Danika\u2019s\nmovements before the kristallos demon killed her. Who she might have met,\nwhat she might have seen or done.\u201d\nAnother bit of bait: to see her reaction to the demon\u2019s breed, when it\nhadn\u2019t yet been made public. Sabine didn\u2019t so much as blink. Like she was\nalready familiar with it\u2014perhaps because she\u2019d been summoning it all\nalong. Though she might just not have cared, Bryce supposed. Sabine\nhissed, \u201cDanika wasn\u2019t at the temple that night. She had nothing to do with\nthe Horn being stolen.\u201d\nBryce avoided the urge to close her eyes at the lie that confirmed\neverything.\nClaws slid from Sabine\u2019s knuckles, embedding in her desk. \u201cWho told\nyou Danika was at the temple?\u201d\n\u201cNo one,\u201d Bryce lied. \u201cI thought I might have remembered her\nmentioning\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou thought?\u201d Sabine sneered, voice rising to imitate Bryce\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s\nhard to remember, isn\u2019t it, when you were high, drunk, and fucking\nstrangers.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Bryce breathed, even as Hunt growled. \u201cThis was a\nmistake.\u201d She didn\u2019t give Hunt time to object before she turned on a heel\nand left, gasping for breath.\nHow she kept her back straight, her stomach inside her body, she had\nno idea.\nShe barely heard Hunt as he fell into step behind her. Couldn\u2019t stand to\nlook at Ithan as she entered the hallway and found him waiting against the\nfar wall.\nBack down the stairs. She didn\u2019t dare look at the wolves she passed.\nShe knew Ithan trailed, but she didn\u2019t care, didn\u2019t care\u2014\n\u201cQuinlan.\u201d Hunt\u2019s voice cut through the marble stairwell. She made it\ndown another flight when he said again, \u201cQuinlan.\u201d\nIt was sharp enough that she paused. Looked up over a shoulder.\nHunt\u2019s eyes scanned her face\u2014worry, not triumph at Sabine\u2019s blatant lie,\nshining there.\nBut Ithan stood between them on the steps, eyes hard as stones. \u201cTell\nme what this is about.\u201d\nHunt drawled, \u201cIt\u2019s classified, asshole.\u201d\nIthan\u2019s snarl rumbled through the stairwell.\n\u201cIt\u2019s starting again,\u201d Bryce said quietly, aware of all the cameras, of\nMicah\u2019s order to keep this quiet. Her voice was rasping. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to\nfigure out why and who\u2019s behind it. Three murders so far. The same way.\nBe careful\u2014warn your pack to be careful.\u201d\nIthan\u2019s face remained unreadable. That had been one of his assets as a\nsunball player\u2014his ability to keep from broadcasting moves to his\nopponents. He\u2019d been brilliant, and cocky as fuck, yes, but that arrogance\nhad been well earned through hours of practice and brutal discipline.\nIthan\u2019s face remained cold. \u201cI\u2019ll let you know if I hear anything.\u201d\n\u201cDo you need our numbers?\u201d Hunt asked coolly.\nIthan\u2019s lip curled. \u201cI have hers.\u201d She struggled to meet his stare,\nespecially as he asked, \u201cAre you going to bother to reply this time?\u201d\nShe turned on her heel and rushed down the stairs into the reception\nhall.\nThe Prime of the wolves stood in it now. Talking to the receptionist,\nhunched over his redwood cane, Danika\u2019s grandfather lifted his withered\nface as she came to an abrupt halt in front of him.\nHis warm brown eyes\u2014those were Danika\u2019s eyes, staring out at her.\nThe ancient male offered her a sad, kind smile. It was worse than any\nof the sneers or snarls.\nBryce managed to bow her head before she bolted through the glass\ndoors.\nShe made it to the gates without running into anyone else. Had almost\nmade it onto the street when Ithan caught up to her, Hunt a step behind.\nIthan said, \u201cYou never deserved him.\u201d\nHe might as well have drawn the knife she knew was hidden in his\nboot and plunged it into her chest. \u201cI know,\u201d she rasped.\nThe pups were still playing, bounding through the high grasses. He\nnodded to the second level, to where Sabine\u2019s office overlooked the\ngreenery. \u201cYou made some dumb fucking choices, Bryce, but I never\npegged you for stupid. She wants you dead.\u201d Another confirmation,\nperhaps.\nThe words snapped something in her. \u201cLikewise.\u201d She pointed to the\ngates, unable to stop the rage boiling in her as she realized that all signs\npointed toward Sabine. \u201cConnor would be ashamed of you for letting\nAmelie run rampant. For letting a piece of shit like that be your Alpha.\u201d\nClaws glinted at Ithan\u2019s knuckles. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever say his name\nagain.\u201d\n\u201cWalk away,\u201d Hunt said softly to him. Lightning licked along his\nwings.\nIthan looked inclined to rip out his throat, but Hunt was already at\nBryce\u2019s side, following her onto the sun-drenched street. She didn\u2019t dare\nlook at Amelie or her pack at the gates, sneering and snickering at them.\n\u201cYou\u2019re trash, Quinlan!\u201d Amelie shouted as they passed by, and her\nfriends roared with laughter.\nBryce couldn\u2019t bear to see if Ithan laughed with them."}, "44": {"Name": "PART III THE CANYON-Chapter 44", "Page Content": " 4 \n\u201cSabine lied about Danika not being at the temple. But we need a solid plan\nfor catching her if she\u2019s summoning this demon,\u201d Hunt said to Bryce twenty\nminutes later over lunch. The angel devoured no less than three bowls of\ncereal, one after another. She hadn\u2019t spoken on the way back to the\napartment. Had needed the entire walk here to reel herself back together.\nBryce pushed at the puffed rice floating around in her own bowl. She\nhad zero interest in eating. \u201cI\u2019m sick of waiting. Just arrest her.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s the unofficial Head of Moonwood and basically the Prime of\nthe wolves,\u201d Hunt cautioned. \u201cIf not in title, then in every other way. We\nhave to be careful how we approach this. The fallout could be catastrophic.\u201d\n\u201cSure.\u201d Bryce poked at her cereal again. She knew she should be\nscreaming, knew she should be marching back to the Den to kill that\nfucking bitch. Bryce ground her teeth. They\u2019d had no word from Tharion or\nRuhn, either.\nHunt tapped a finger on the glass table, weighing her expression. Then\nhe mercifully switched subjects. \u201cI get Ithan\u2019s history, but what\u2019s Amelie\u2019s\nproblem with you?\u201d\nMaybe Bryce was just tired, but she wound up saying, \u201cDid you ever\nsee them\u2014the messages from that night? Every newspaper had them on the\nfront page after they leaked.\u201d\nHunt stilled. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said gently. \u201cI did.\u201d\nShe shrugged, swirling the cereal in her bowl. Around and around.\n\u201cAmelie had \u2026 a thing. For Connor. Since they were kids. I think she\nstill does.\u201d\n\u201cAh.\u201d\n\u201cAnd\u2014you know about me and Connor.\u201d\n\u201cYeah. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nShe hated those two words. Had heard them so many times she just\nfucking hated them. She said, \u201cWhen she saw the messages from that night,\nI think Amelie finally realized why he had never returned her feelings.\u201d\nHe frowned. \u201cIt\u2019s been two years.\u201d\n\u201cSo?\u201d It sure as shit hadn\u2019t done anything to help her feel better about\nit.\nHunt shook his head. \u201cPeople still bring them up? Those messages?\u201d\n\u201cOf course.\u201d She snorted, shaking her head. \u201cJust look me up online,\nAthalar. I had to shut down every account I had.\u201d The thought made her\nstomach churn, nauseating panic tightening every muscle and vein in her\nbody. She\u2019d gotten better about managing it\u2014that feeling\u2014but not by\nmuch. \u201cPeople hate me. Literally hate me. Some of the wolf packs even\nwrote a song and put it online\u2014they called it \u2018I Just Hooked Up with\nSomeone in the Bathroom, Don\u2019t Tell Connor.\u2019 They sing it whenever they\nsee me.\u201d\nHis face had gone cold as ice. \u201cWhich packs?\u201d\nShe shook her head. She certainly wouldn\u2019t name them, not with that\nmurderous expression on his face. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. People are assholes.\u201d\nIt was as simple as that, she\u2019d learned. Most people were assholes, and\nthis city was rife with them.\nShe sometimes wondered what they\u2019d say if they knew about that time\ntwo winters ago when someone had sent a thousand printed-out lyric sheets\nof the song to her new apartment, along with mock album artwork taken\nfrom the photos she\u2019d snapped that night. If they knew she had gone up to\nthe roof to burn them all\u2014but instead wound up staring over the ledge. She\nwondered what would have happened if Juniper, on a whim, hadn\u2019t called\njust to check in that night. Right as Bryce had braced her hands on the rail.\nOnly that friendly voice on the other end of the line kept Bryce from\nwalking right off the roof.\nJuniper had kept Bryce on the phone\u2014babbling about nothing. Right\nuntil her cab had pulled up in front of the apartment. Juniper refused to\nhang up until she was on the roof with Bryce, laughing it off. She\u2019d only\nknown where to find her because Bryce had mumbled something about\nsitting there. And perhaps she\u2019d rushed over because of how hollow Bryce\u2019s\nvoice had been when she\u2019d said it.\nJuniper had stayed to burn the copies of the song, then gone downstairs\nto the apartment, where they\u2019d watched TV in bed until they fell asleep.\nBryce had risen at one point to turn off the TV and use the bathroom; when\nshe\u2019d come back, Juniper had been awake, waiting.\nHer friend didn\u2019t leave her side for three days.\nThey\u2019d never spoken of it. But Bryce wondered if Juniper had later\ntold Fury how close it had been, how hard she\u2019d worked to keep that phone\ncall going while she raced over without alerting Bryce, sensing that\nsomething was wrong-wrong-wrong.\nBryce didn\u2019t like to think about that winter. That night. But she would\nnever stop being grateful for Juniper for that sense\u2014that love that had kept\nher from making such a terrible, stupid mistake.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Hunt said, \u201cpeople are assholes.\u201d\nShe supposed he\u2019d had it worse than her. A lot worse.\nTwo centuries of slavery that was barely disguised as some sort of\ntwisted path to redemption. Micah\u2019s bargain with him, reduced or no, was a\ndisgrace.\nShe made herself take a bite of her now-soggy cereal. Made herself ask\nsomething, anything, to clear her head a bit. \u201cDid you make up your\nnickname? The Shadow of Death?\u201d\nHunt set down his spoon. \u201cDo I look like the sort of person who needs\nto make up nicknames for myself?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Bryce admitted.\n\u201cThey only call me that because I\u2019m ordered to do that sort of shit.\nAnd I do it well.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cThey\u2019d be better off calling me Slave of\nDeath.\u201d\nShe bit her lip and took another bite of cereal.\nHunt cleared his throat. \u201cI know that visit today was hard. And I know\nI didn\u2019t act like it at first, Quinlan, but I\u2019m glad you got put on this case.\nYou\u2019ve been \u2026 really great.\u201d\nShe tucked away what his praise did to her heart, how it lifted the fog\nthat had settled on her. \u201cMy dad was a Dracon captain in the 25th Legion.\nThey stationed him at the front for the entire three years of his military\nservice. He taught me a few things.\u201d\n\u201cI know. Not about you being taught, I mean. But about your dad.\nRandall Silago, right? He\u2019s the one who taught you to shoot.\u201d\nShe nodded, an odd sort of pride wending its way through her.\nHunt said, \u201cI never fought beside him, but I heard of him the last time I\nwas sent to the front\u2014around twenty-six years ago. Heard about his\nsharpshooting, I mean. What does he think about \u2026\u201d A wave of his hand to\nher, the city around them.\n\u201cHe wants me to move back home. I had to go to the mat with him\u2014\nliterally\u2014to win the fight about going to CCU.\u201d\n\u201cYou physically fought him?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. He said if I could pin him, then I knew enough about defense to\nhold my own in the city. Turns out, I\u2019d been paying more attention than I\u2019d\nlet him believe.\u201d\nHunt\u2019s low laugh skittered over her skin. \u201cAnd he taught you how to\nshoot a sniper rifle?\u201d\n\u201cRifles, handguns, knives, swords.\u201d But guns were Randall\u2019s specialty.\nHe\u2019d taught her ruthlessly, over and over and over again.\n\u201cYou ever use any outside of practice?\u201d\nI love you, Bryce.\nClose your eyes, Danika.\n\u201cWhen I had to,\u201d she rasped. Not that it had made a difference when it\nmattered.\nHer phone buzzed. She glanced at the message from Jesiba and\ngroaned.\nA client is coming in thirty minutes. Be there or you\u2019ve got a one-way\nticket to life as a vole.\nBryce set down her spoon, aware of Hunt watching her, and began to\ntype. I\u2019ll be at\u2014\nJesiba added another message before Bryce could reply. And where is\nthat paperwork from yesterday?\nBryce deleted what she\u2019d written, and began writing, I\u2019ll get it\u2014\nAnother message from Jesiba: I want it done by noon.\n\u201cSomeone\u2019s pissed off,\u201d Hunt observed, and Bryce grimaced, grabbing\nup her bowl and hurrying to the sink.\nThe messages kept coming in on the walk over, along with half a\ndozen threats to turn her into various pathetic creatures, suggesting\nsomeone had indeed royally pissed off Jesiba. When they reached the\ngallery door, Bryce unlocked the physical and magical locks and sighed.\n\u201cMaybe you should stay on the roof this afternoon. She\u2019s probably going to\nbe monitoring me on the cameras. I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s seen you inside\nbefore, but \u2026\u201d\nHe clapped a hand on her shoulder. \u201cGot it, Quinlan.\u201d His black jacket\nbuzzed, and he pulled out his phone. \u201cIt\u2019s Isaiah,\u201d he murmured, and\nnodded to the now-open door of the gallery, through which they could see\nSyrinx scratching at the library door, yowling his greeting to Lehabah. \u201cI\u2019ll\ncheck in later,\u201d he said.\nHe waited to fly to the roof, she knew, until she\u2019d locked the gallery\ndoor behind herself. A message from him appeared fifteen minutes later.\nIsaiah needs me for an opinion on a different case. Heading over now.\nJustinian\u2019s watching you. I\u2019ll be back in a few hours.\nShe wrote back, Is Justinian hot?\nHe answered, Who\u2019s the pervert now?\nA smile pulled at her mouth.\nHer thumbs were hovering over the keyboard to reply when her phone\nrang. Sighing, she raised it to her ear to answer.\n\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you ready for the client?\u201d Jesiba demanded.\nThis morning had been a wreck. Standing guard on the roof of the gallery\nhours later, Hunt couldn\u2019t stop thinking it. Yes, they\u2019d caught Sabine in her\nlie, and all signs pointed toward her as the murderer, but \u2026 Fuck. He hadn\u2019t\nrealized how rough it\u2019d be on Quinlan, even knowing Sabine hated her.\nHadn\u2019t realized the other wolves had it out for Bryce, too. He should never\nhave brought her. Should have gone himself.\nThe hours ticked by, one by one, as he mulled it all over.\nHunt made sure no one was flying over the roof before he pulled up\nthe video footage, accessed from the 33rd\u2019s archives. Someone had\ncompiled the short reel, no doubt an attempt to get a better image of the\ndemon than a toe or a claw.\nThe kristallos was a gray blur as it exploded from the front door of the\napartment building. They hadn\u2019t been able to get footage of it actually\nentering the building, which suggested it had either been summoned on-site\nor had snuck through the roof, and no nearby cameras had picked it up,\neither. But here it was, shattering the front door, so fast it was just gray\nsmoke.\nAnd then\u2014there she was. Bryce. Hurtling through the door, barefoot\nand running on shards of glass, table leg in her hand, pure rage twisting her\nface.\nHe\u2019d seen the footage two years ago, but it made slightly more sense\nnow, knowing that Randall Silago had trained her. Watching her leap over\ncars, careening down streets, as fast as a Fae male. Her face was smeared\nwith blood, her lips curled in a snarl he couldn\u2019t hear.\nBut even in the grainy video footage, her eyes were hazy. Still fighting\nthose drugs.\nShe definitely didn\u2019t remember that he\u2019d been in that interrogation\nroom with her, if she\u2019d asked about the messages during lunch. And, fuck\u2014\nhe\u2019d known everything from her phone had leaked, but he\u2019d never thought\nabout what it must have been like.\nShe was right: people were assholes.\nBryce cleared Main Street, sliding over the hood of a car, and then the\nfootage ended.\nHunt blew out a breath. If it really was Sabine behind this \u2026 Micah\nhad given him permission to take out the culprit. But Bryce might very well\ndo it herself.\nHunt frowned toward the wall of fog just visible across the river, the\nmists impenetrable even in the afternoon sunlight. The Bone Quarter.\nNo one knew what went on in the Sleeping City. If the dead roamed\nthrough the mausoleums, if the Reapers patrolled and ruled like kings, if it\nwas merely mist and carved stone and silence. No one flew over it\u2014no one\ndared.\nBut Hunt sometimes felt like the Bone Quarter watched them, and\nsome people claimed that their beloved dead could communicate through\nthe Oracle or cheap market psychics.\nTwo years ago, Bryce hadn\u2019t been at Danika\u2019s Sailing. He\u2019d looked.\nThe most important people in Crescent City had gone, but she hadn\u2019t been\nthere. Either to avoid Sabine killing her on sight, or for reasons of her own.\nAfter what he\u2019d seen today, his money was on the former.\nSo she hadn\u2019t witnessed Sabine pushing the ancient black boat into the\nIstros, the gray silk-shrouded box\u2014all that remained of Danika\u2019s body\u2014in\nits center. Hadn\u2019t counted the seconds as it drifted into the muddy waters,\nholding her breath with all those on shore to see if the boat would be picked\nup by that swift current that would bring it to the shores of the Bone\nQuarter, or if it would overturn, Danika\u2019s unworthy remains given to the\nriver and the beasts who swam within it.\nBut Danika\u2019s boat headed straight for the mist-shrouded island across\nthe river, the Under-King deeming her worthy, and more than one person\nhad heaved a sigh. The audio from the apartment building\u2019s shitty hall\ncamera of Danika begging for mercy had leaked a day before.\nHunt had suspected that half the people who\u2019d come to her Sailing\nhoped Danika\u2019s begging meant she\u2019d be given to the river, that they could\ndeem the haughty and wild former Alpha a coward.\nSabine, clearly aware of those anticipating such an outcome, had only\nwaited until the river gates opened to reveal the swirling mists of the Bone\nQuarter, the boat tugged inside by invisible hands, and then left. She didn\u2019t\nwait to see the Sailings for the rest of the Pack of Devils.\nBut Hunt and everyone else had. It had been the last time he\u2019d seen\nIthan Holstrom. Weeping as he pushed his brother\u2019s remains into the blue\nwaters, so distraught his sunball teammates had been forced to hold him up.\nThe cold-eyed male who\u2019d served as escort today was a wholly different\nperson from that boy.\nTalented, Hunt had heard Naomi say of Ithan in her endless running\ncommentary about the Aux packs and how they stacked up to the 33rd.\nBeyond his skill on the sunball field, Ithan Holstrom was a gifted warrior,\nwho had made the Drop and come within spitting distance of Connor\u2019s\npower. Naomi always said that despite being cocky, Ithan was a solid male:\nfair-minded, smart, and loyal.\nAnd a fucking prick, it seemed.\nHunt shook his head, again staring toward the Bone Quarter.\nDid Danika Fendyr roam that misty island? Or part of her, at least? Did\nshe remember the friend who, even so long after her death, took no shit\nfrom anyone who insulted her memory? Did she know that Bryce would do\nanything, possibly descend to the level of rage forever preserved in the\nvideo, to destroy her killer? Even if that killer was Danika\u2019s own mother?\nLoyal unto death and beyond.\nHunt\u2019s phone rang, Isaiah\u2019s name popping up again, but Hunt didn\u2019t\nimmediately answer. Not as he glanced at the gallery roof beneath his boots\nand wondered what it was like\u2014to have a friend like that."}, "45": {"Name": "PART III THE CANYON-Chapter 45", "Page Content": " 5 \n\u201cSo do you think you\u2019ll get promoted to principal after the season?\u201d Her\nshoulder wedging her phone against her ear, Bryce toed off her shoes at her\napartment door and strode for the wall of windows. Syrinx, freed of his\nleash, ran for his food bowl to await his dinner.\n\u201cDoubtful,\u201d Juniper said, her voice soft and quiet. \u201cEugenie is really\nkilling it this year. I think she\u2019ll be tapped for principal next. I\u2019ve been a\nlittle off in some of my solos, I can feel it.\u201d\nBryce peered out the window, spotted Hunt precisely where he said\nhe\u2019d wait until she signaled that she was safe and sound in her apartment,\nand waved. \u201cYou know you\u2019ve been awesome. Don\u2019t pretend that you\u2019re\nnot killing it, too.\u201d\nHunt lifted a hand and launched skyward, winking at her as he flew\npast the window, then headed to the Munin and Hugin.\nHe hadn\u2019t been able to convince her to join his triarii companions at\nthe bar, and had made her swear on all five gods that she wouldn\u2019t leave her\napartment or open the door for anyone while he was gone.\nWell, for almost anyone.\nFrom their brief conversation, she\u2019d gleaned that Hunt was invited\noften to the bar, but had never gone. Why he was going tonight for the first\ntime \u2026 Maybe she was driving him nuts. She hadn\u2019t sensed that, but maybe\nhe just needed a night off.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing all right, I guess,\u201d Juniper admitted.\nBryce clicked her tongue. \u201cYou\u2019re so full of shit with that \u2018all right\u2019\ncrap.\u201d\n\u201cI was thinking, B,\u201d Juniper said carefully. \u201cMy instructor mentioned\nthat she\u2019s starting a dance class that\u2019s open to the general public. You could\ngo.\u201d\n\u201cYour instructor is the most in-demand teacher in this city. No way I\u2019d\nget in,\u201d Bryce deflected, watching the cars and pedestrians stream past\nbelow her window.\n\u201cI know,\u201d Juniper said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I asked her to save you a spot.\u201d\nBryce stilled. \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot going on right now.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a two-hour class, twice a week. After work hours.\u201d\n\u201cThanks, but I\u2019m good.\u201d\n\u201cYou were, Bryce. You were good.\u201d\nBryce clenched her teeth. \u201cNot fucking good enough.\u201d\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t matter to you before Danika died. Just go to the class. It\u2019s not\nan audition\u2014it\u2019s literally just a class for people who love to dance. Which\nyou do.\u201d\n\u201cWhich I did.\u201d\nJuniper\u2019s breath rattled the phone. \u201cDanika would be heartbroken to\nhear you don\u2019t dance anymore. Even for fun.\u201d\nBryce made a show of humming with consideration. \u201cI\u2019ll think about\nit.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d Juniper said. \u201cI\u2019m sending you the details.\u201d\nBryce changed the subject. \u201cYou wanna come over and watch some\ntrashy TV? Beach House Hookup is on tonight at nine.\u201d\nJuniper asked slyly, \u201cIs the angel there?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s out for beers with his little cabal of killers.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re called the triarii, Bryce.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, just ask them.\u201d Bryce turned from the window and aimed for\nthe kitchen. Syrinx still waited at his food bowl, lion\u2019s tail waggling.\n\u201cWould it make a difference if Hunt was here?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d be over a Hel of a lot faster.\u201d\nBryce laughed. \u201cShameless.\u201d She scooped Syrinx\u2019s food into his bowl.\nHis claws clicked as he pranced in place, counting each kibble piece.\n\u201cUnfortunately for you, I think he\u2019s hung up on someone.\u201d\n\u201cUnfortunately for you.\u201d\n\u201cPlease.\u201d She opened the fridge and pulled out an assortment of food.\nA grazer\u2019s dinner it was. \u201cI met a mer the other day who was so hot you\ncould have fried an egg on his ten billion abs.\u201d\n\u201cNone of what you said makes any sort of sense, but I think I get the\npoint.\u201d\nBryce laughed again. \u201cShould I get a veggie burger warmed up for\nyou, or what?\u201d\n\u201cI wish I could, but\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBut you have to practice.\u201d\nJuniper sighed. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be made principal by lounging on a\ncouch all night.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll get injured if you push yourself too hard. You\u2019re already doing\neight shows a week.\u201d\nThe soft voice sharpened. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Maybe Sunday, okay?\u201d The only\nday the dance company didn\u2019t perform.\n\u201cSure,\u201d Bryce said. Her chest tightened, enough that she said, \u201cCall me\nwhen you\u2019re free.\u201d\n\u201cWill do.\u201d\nTheir goodbyes were quick, and Bryce had barely hung up when she\ndialed another number.\nFury\u2019s phone went right to audiomail. Not bothering to leave a\nmessage, Bryce set down her phone and pried open the container of\nhummus, then leftover noodles, then some possibly rotten pork stew. Magic\nkept most of the food in her fridge fresh, but there were rational limits.\nGrunting, she dumped the stew into the trash. Syrinx frowned up at\nher.\n\u201cEven you wouldn\u2019t eat that, my friend,\u201d she said.\nSyrinx waggled his tail again and bounded for the couch.\nThe silence of her apartment grew heavy.\nOne friend\u2014that was what her social circle had become. Fury had\nmade it clear she had no interest in bothering with her anymore.\nSo now, with her solitary friend too busy with her career to hang out\non a reliable schedule, especially in the upcoming summer months when the\ncompany performed throughout the week \u2026 Bryce supposed she was down\nto zero.\nBryce half-heartedly ate the hummus, dipping slightly slimy carrots\ninto the spread. The crunch of them filled the silence of the apartment.\nThat too-familiar surge of self-pity came creeping in, and Bryce\nchucked the carrots and hummus in the garbage before padding for the\ncouch.\nShe flipped through the channels until she found the local news.\nSyrinx peered up at her expectantly. \u201cJust you and me tonight, bud,\u201d she\nsaid, plopping down next to him.\nOn the news, Rigelus, Bright Hand of the Asteri, appeared, giving\nsome speech on new trade laws at a gilded podium. Behind him, the five\nother Asteri sat enthroned in their crystal chamber, cold-faced and radiating\nwealth and power. As always, the seventh throne sat empty in honor of their\nlong-dead sister. Bryce changed the channel again, this time to another\nnews station, blasting footage of lines of human-built mech-suits going toe-\nto-toe with elite Imperial Legions on a muddy battlefield. Another channel\nshowed starving humans lined up for bread in the Eternal City, their\nchildren wailing with hunger.\nBryce switched to a show about buying vacation houses unseen and\nwatched without really processing it.\nWhen was the last time she\u2019d read a book? Not for work or research,\nbut for pleasure? She\u2019d read loads before everything with Danika, but that\npart of her brain had just turned off afterward.\nShe\u2019d wanted to drown out any sort of calm and quiet. The blaring\ntelevision had become her companion to drive the silence away. The\ndumber the show, the better.\nShe nestled into the cushions, Syrinx curling up tightly against her leg\nas she scratched at his velvet-soft ears. He wriggled in a request for more.\nThe silence pushed in, tighter and thicker. Her mouth dried out, her\nlimbs going light and hollow. The events at the Den threatened to begin\nlooping, Ithan\u2019s cold face at the forefront.\nShe peered at the clock. Barely five thirty.\nBryce blew out a long breath. Lehabah was wrong\u2014this wasn\u2019t like\nthat winter. Nothing could ever be as bad as that first winter without\nDanika. She wouldn\u2019t let it.\nShe stood, Syrinx huffing with annoyance at being disturbed.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be back soon,\u201d she promised, pointing toward the hall and his\ncrate.\nThrowing her a baleful look, the chimera saw himself into his cage,\nyanking the metal door shut with a hooked claw.\nBryce locked it, reassuring him again that she wouldn\u2019t be out for long,\nand slipped back into her heels. She\u2019d promised Hunt she would stay put\u2014\nhad sworn it on the gods.\nToo bad the angel didn\u2019t know that she no longer prayed to any of\nthem.\nHunt had drunk all of half a beer when his phone rang.\nHe knew exactly what had happened before he picked up. \u201cShe left,\ndidn\u2019t she?\u201d\nNaomi let out a quiet laugh. \u201cYeah. All glammed up, too.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s how she usually is,\u201d he grumbled, rubbing his temple.\nDown the carved oak bar, Vik arched a graceful eyebrow, her halo\nshifting with the movement. Hunt shook his head and reached for his\nwallet. He shouldn\u2019t have come out tonight. The offer had been thrown to\nhim so many times these past four years, and he\u2019d never gone, not when it\nhad felt so much like being in the 18th again. But this time, when Isaiah had\ncalled with his standard caveat (I know you\u2019ll say no, but \u2026) he\u2019d said yes.\nHe didn\u2019t know why, but he\u2019d gone.\nHunt asked, \u201cWhere\u2019d she head?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m tracking her now,\u201d Naomi said, the wind rustling on her end of\nthe line. She hadn\u2019t asked questions when Hunt had called her an hour ago\nto ask that she guard Bryce\u2014and give up her spot in tonight\u2019s hangout.\n\u201cLooks like she\u2019s headed toward FiRo.\u201d\nMaybe she was seeking out her cousin for an update. \u201cStay close, and\nkeep your guard up,\u201d he said. He knew he didn\u2019t need to say it. Naomi was\none of the most talented warriors he\u2019d ever encountered, and took no shit\nfrom anyone. One look at her tightly braided black hair, the colorful tattoo\nthat covered her hands, and the array of weapons on her muscled body and\nmost people didn\u2019t dare to tangle with her. Maybe even Bryce would have\nobeyed an order to stay put, if Naomi had been the one to give it. \u201cSend me\nyour coordinates.\u201d\n\u201cWill do.\u201d The line went dead.\nHunt sighed. Viktoria said, \u201cYou should have known better, friend.\u201d\nHunt ran his hands through his hair. \u201cYeah.\u201d\nBeside him, Isaiah swigged from his beer. \u201cYou could let Naomi\nhandle her.\u201d\n\u201cI have a feeling that would result in them unleashing Hel together,\nand I\u2019d still need to go end their fun.\u201d\nVik and Isaiah chuckled, and Hunt dropped a silver mark on the bar.\nViktoria held up a hand in protest, but Hunt ignored it. They might all be\nslaves, but he could pay for his own damn drink. \u201cI\u2019ll see you two later.\u201d\nIsaiah raised his beer in salute, and Viktoria gave him a knowing smile\nbefore Hunt elbowed his way through the packed bar. Justinian, playing\npool in the back, lifted a hand in farewell. Hunt had never asked why all of\nthem preferred the tight quarters of the street-level bar to one of the rooftop\nlounges most angels frequented. He supposed he wouldn\u2019t get the chance to\nlearn why tonight.\nHunt wasn\u2019t surprised that Bryce had bailed. Frankly, the only thing\nthat surprised him was that she\u2019d waited this long.\nHe shouldered through the leaded glass door and out onto the muggy\nstreet beyond. Patrons drank at reclaimed oak barrels, and a raucous group\nof some sort of shifter pack\u2014perhaps wolves or one of the big cats\u2014puffed\naway on cigarettes.\nHunt scowled at the reek that chased him into the sky, then frowned\nagain at the clouds rolling in from the west, the heavy scent of rain already\non the wind. Fantastic.\nNaomi sent over her coordinates in Five Roses, and a five-minute\nflight had Hunt arriving at one of the night gardens, just beginning to\nawaken with the fading light. Naomi\u2019s black wings were a stain against the\ncreeping darkness as she hovered in place above a fountain filled with\nmoon lilies, the bioluminescent flowers already open and glowing pale\nblue.\n\u201cThat way,\u201d Naomi said, the harsh planes of her face gilded by the soft\nlight from the plants.\nHunt nodded to the angel. \u201cThanks.\u201d\n\u201cGood luck.\u201d The words were enough to set him on edge, and Hunt\ndidn\u2019t bother saying goodbye before soaring down the path. Star oaks lined\nit, their leaves glittering in a living canopy overhead. The gentle\nillumination danced on Bryce\u2019s hair as she ambled down the stone path,\nnight-blooming flowers opening around her. Jasmine lay heavy in the\ntwilight air, sweet and beckoning.\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t give me an hour of peace?\u201d\nBryce didn\u2019t flinch as he dropped into step beside her. \u201cI wanted some\nfresh air.\u201d She admired an unfurling fern, its fronds lit from within to\nilluminate every vein.\n\u201cWere you going somewhere in particular?\u201d\n\u201cJust\u2014out.\u201d\n\u201cAh.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m waiting for you to start yelling.\u201d She continued past beds of night\ncrocuses, their purple petals shimmering amid the vibrant moss. The garden\nseemed to awaken for her, welcome her.\n\u201cI\u2019ll yell when I find out what was so important that you broke your\npromise.\u201d\n\u201cNothing.\u201d\n\u201cNothing?\u201d\n\u201cNothing is important.\u201d\nShe said the words with enough quiet that he watched her carefully.\n\u201cYou all right?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Definitely no, then.\nShe admitted, \u201cThe quiet bothers me sometimes.\u201d\n\u201cI invited you to the bar.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to go to a bar with a bunch of triarii.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\nShe cut him a sidelong glance. \u201cI\u2019m a civilian. They wouldn\u2019t be able\nto relax.\u201d\nHunt opened his mouth to deny it, but she gave him a look. \u201cFine,\u201d he\nadmitted. \u201cMaybe.\u201d\nThey walked in silence for a few steps. \u201cYou could go back to your\ndrinking, you know. That ominous-looking angel you sent to babysit me can\nhandle it.\u201d\n\u201cNaomi left.\u201d\n\u201cShe looks intense.\u201d\n\u201cShe is.\u201d\nBryce threw him a hint of a smile. \u201cYou two \u2026?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Though Naomi had hinted about it on occasion. \u201cIt\u2019d complicate\nthings.\u201d\n\u201cMmm.\u201d\n\u201cWere you on your way to meet your friends?\u201d\nShe shook her head. \u201cJust the one friend these days, Athalar. And she\u2019s\ntoo busy.\u201d\n\u201cSo you were going out alone. To do what?\u201d\n\u201cWalk through this garden.\u201d\n\u201cAlone.\u201d\n\u201cI knew you\u2019d send a babysitter.\u201d\nHunt moved before he could think, gripping her elbow.\nShe peered up into his face. \u201cIs this the part where you start yelling?\u201d\nLightning cracked through the sky, and echoed in his veins as he\nleaned closer and purred, \u201cWould you like me to yell, Bryce Quinlan?\u201d\nHer throat bobbed, her eyes glowing with golden fire. \u201cMaybe?\u201d\nHunt let out a low laugh. Didn\u2019t try to stop the heat that flooded him.\n\u201cThat can be arranged.\u201d\nAll of his focus narrowed on the dip of her eyes to his mouth. The\nblush that bloomed over her freckled cheeks, inviting him to taste every\nrosy inch.\nNo one and nothing existed but this\u2014but her.\nHe never heard the night-dark bushes behind him rustling. Never heard\nthe branches cracking.\nNot until the kristallos crashed into him and sank its teeth into his\nshoulder."}, "46": {"Name": "PART III THE CANYON-Chapter 46", "Page Content": " 6 \nThe kristallos slammed into Hunt with the force of an SUV.\nBryce knew he only had enough time to either draw a weapon or shove\nher out of the way. Hunt chose her.\nShe hit the asphalt several feet from him, bones barking, and froze.\nAngel and demon went down, the kristallos pinning Hunt with a roar that\nsent the night garden shuddering.\nIt was worse. So much worse than that night.\nBlood sprayed, and a knife glinted as Hunt pulled it from its sheath\nand plunged it into the grayish, near-translucent hide.\nVeins of lightning wreathed Hunt\u2019s hands\u2014and faded into blackness.\nPeople screamed and bolted down the path, cries to run! ringing\nthrough the glowing flora. Bryce barely heard them as she climbed to her\nknees.\nHunt rolled, flipping the creature off him and onto the pathway,\nwrenching his knife free in the process. Clear blood dripped down the blade\nas Hunt angled it in front of himself, his shredded arm outflung to protect\nBryce. Lightning flared and sputtered at his fingertips.\n\u201cCall for backup,\u201d he panted without taking his focus off the demon,\nwho paced a step, a clawed hand\u2014crystalline talons glinting\u2014going to the\nwound in its side.\nShe\u2019d never seen anything like it. Anything so unearthly, so primal and\nraging. Her memory of that night was fogged with rage and grief and drugs,\nso this, the real, undiluted thing\u2014\nBryce reached for her phone, but the creature lunged for Hunt.\nThe angel\u2019s blade drove home. It made no difference.\nThey again toppled to the path, and Hunt bellowed as the demon\u2019s\njaws wrapped around his forearm and crunched.\nHis lightning died out entirely.\nMove. Move, she had to move\u2014\nHunt\u2019s free fist slammed into the creature\u2019s face hard enough to crack\nbone, but the crystal teeth remained clamped.\nThis thing pinned him down so easily. Had it done just this to Danika?\nShredding and shredding?\nHunt grunted, brow bunched in pain and concentration. His lightning\nhad vanished. Not one flicker of it rose again.\nEvery part of her shook.\nHunt punched the demon\u2019s face again, \u201cBryce\u2014\u201d\nShe scrambled into movement. Not for her phone, but for the gun\nholstered at Hunt\u2019s hip.\nThe blind demon sensed her, its nostrils flaring as her fingers wrapped\naround the handgun. She freed the safety, hauling it up as she uncoiled to\nher feet.\nThe creature released Hunt\u2019s arm and leapt for her. Bryce fired, but too\nslow. The demon lunged to the side, dodging her bullet. Bryce fell back as it\nroared and leapt for her again\u2014\nIts head snapped to the side, clear blood spraying like rain as a knife\nembedded itself to the hilt just above its mouth.\nHunt was upon it again, drawing another long knife from a hidden\npanel down the back of his battle-suit and plunging the blade right into the\nskull and toward the spine.\nThe creature struggled, snapping for Bryce, its clear teeth stained red\nwith Hunt\u2019s blood. She\u2019d wound up on the pavement somehow, and crawled\nbackward as it tried to lunge for her. Failed to, as Hunt wrapped his hands\naround the blade and twisted.\nThe crack of its severing neck was muffled by the moss-shrouded\ntrees.\nBryce still aimed the handgun. \u201cGet out of the way.\u201d\nHunt released his grip, letting the creature slump to the mossy path. Its\nblack tongue lolled from its clear-fanged mouth.\n\u201cJust in case,\u201d Bryce said, and fired. She didn\u2019t miss this time.\nSirens wailed, and wings filled the air. Ringing droned in her head.\nHunt withdrew his blade from the creature\u2019s skull and brought it down\nwith a mighty, one-armed sweep. The severed head tumbled away. Hunt\nmoved again, and the head split in half. Then quarters.\nAnother plunge and the hateful heart was skewered, too. Clear blood\nleaked everywhere, like a spilled vial of serum.\nBryce stared and stared at its ruined head, the horrible, monstrous\nbody.\nPowerful forms landed among them, that black-winged malakh\ninstantly at Hunt\u2019s side. \u201cHoly shit, Hunt, what\u2014\u201d\nBryce barely heard the words. Someone helped her to her feet. Blue\nlight flared, and a magi-screen encompassed the site, blocking it from the\nview of any who hadn\u2019t yet fled. She should have been screaming, should\nhave been leaping for the demon, ripping apart its corpse with her bare\nhands. But only a thrumming silence filled her head.\nShe looked around the park, stupidly and slowly, as if she might see\nSabine there.\nHunt groaned, and she whirled as he tumbled face-first to the ground.\nThe dark-winged angel caught him, her powerful body easily bearing his\nweight. \u201cGet a medwitch here now!\u201d\nHis shoulder was gushing blood. So was his forearm. Blood, and some\nsort of silvery slime.\nShe knew the burn of that slime, like living fire.\nA head of sleek black curls streamed past, and Bryce blinked as a\ncurvy young woman in a medwitch\u2019s blue jumpsuit unhooked the bag\nacross her chest and slid to her knees beside Hunt.\nHe was bent over, a hand at his forearm, panting heavily. His gray\nwings sagged, splattered with both clear and red blood.\nThe medwitch asked him something, the broom-and-bell insignia on\nher right arm catching the blue light of the screens. Her brown hands didn\u2019t\nfalter as she used a pair of tweezers to extract what looked to be a small\nworm from a glass jar full of damp moss and set it on Hunt\u2019s forearm.\nHe winced, teeth flashing.\n\u201cSucking out the venom,\u201d a female voice explained beside Bryce. The\ndark-winged angel. Naomi. She pointed a tattooed finger toward Hunt.\n\u201cThey\u2019re mithridate leeches.\u201d\nThe leech\u2019s black body swiftly swelled. The witch set another on\nHunt\u2019s shoulder wound. Then another on his forearm.\nBryce said nothing.\nHunt\u2019s face was pale, his eyes shut as he seemed to focus on his\nbreathing. \u201cI think the venom nullified my power. As soon as it bit me \u2026\u201d\nHe hissed at whatever agony worked through his body. \u201cI couldn\u2019t summon\nmy lightning.\u201d\nRecognition jolted through her. It explained so much. Why the\nkristallos had been able to pin Micah, for one thing. If it had ambushed the\nArchangel and gotten a good bite, he would have been left with only\nphysical strength. Micah had probably never even realized what happened.\nHad likely written it off as shock or the swiftness of the attack. Perhaps the\nbite had nullified the preternatural strength of Danika and the Pack of\nDevils, too.\n\u201cHey.\u201d Naomi put a hand on Bryce\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou hurt?\u201d\nThe medwitch peeled a poison-eating leech from Hunt\u2019s shoulder,\nthrew it back in the glass jar, then replaced it with another. Pale light\nwreathed her hands as she assessed Hunt\u2019s other injuries, then began the\nprocess of healing them. She didn\u2019t bother with the vials of firstlight\nglowing in her bag\u2014a cure-all for many medics. As if she preferred using\nthe magic in her own veins.\n\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\nHunt\u2019s body might have been able to heal itself, but it would have\ntaken longer. With the venom in those wounds, Bryce knew too well that it\nmight not really heal at all.\nNaomi ran a hand over her inky hair. \u201cYou should let that medwitch\nexamine you.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nHer onyx eyes sharpened. \u201cIf Hunt can let the medwitch work on him,\nthen you\u2014\u201d\nVast, cold power erupted through the site, the garden, the whole\nquarter of the city. Naomi whirled as Micah landed. Silence fell, Vanir of all\ntypes backing away as the Archangel prowled toward the fallen demon and\nHunt.\nNaomi was the only one with enough balls to approach him. \u201cI was on\nwatch right before Hunt arrived and there was no sign\u2014\u201d\nMicah stalked past her, his eyes pinned on the demon. The medwitch,\nto her credit, didn\u2019t halt her ministrations, but Hunt managed to lift his head\nto meet Micah\u2019s interrogation.\n\u201cWhat happened.\u201d\n\u201cAmbush,\u201d Hunt said, his voice gravelly.\nMicah\u2019s white wings seemed to glow with power. And for all the\nringing silence in Bryce\u2019s head, all the distance she now felt between her\nbody and what remained of her soul, she stepped up. Like Hel would this\njeopardize Micah\u2019s bargain with Hunt. Bryce said, \u201cIt came out of the\nshadows.\u201d\nThe Archangel raked his eyes over her. \u201cWhich one of you did it\nattack?\u201d\nBryce pointed to Hunt. \u201cHim.\u201d\n\u201cAnd which one of you killed it?\u201d\nBryce began to repeat \u201cHim,\u201d but Hunt cut in, \u201cIt was a joint effort.\u201d\nBryce shot him a look to keep quiet, but Micah had already pivoted to the\ndemon\u2019s corpse. He toed it with his boot, frowning.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t let the press get wind of this,\u201d Micah ordered. \u201cOr the others\ncoming in for the Summit.\u201d The unspoken part of that statement lingered.\nSandriel doesn\u2019t hear a word.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll keep it out of the papers,\u201d Naomi promised.\nBut Micah shook his head, and extended a hand.\nBefore Bryce could so much as blink, white flame erupted around the\ndemon and its head. Within a second, it was nothing more than ash.\nHunt started. \u201cWe needed to examine it for evidence\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo press,\u201d Micah said, then turned toward a cluster of angel\ncommanders.\nThe medwitch began removing her leeches and bandaging Hunt. Each\nof the silk strips was imbued with her power, willing the skin and muscle to\nknit back together and staving off infection. They\u2019d dissolve once the\nwounds had healed, as if they\u2019d never existed.\nThe pile of ashes still lay there, mockingly soft considering the true\nterror the kristallos had wrought. Had this demon been the one to kill\nDanika, or merely one of thousands waiting on the other side of the\nNorthern Rift?\nWas the Horn here, in this park? Had she somehow, unwittingly, come\nnear it? Or maybe whoever was looking for it\u2014Sabine?\u2014simply sent the\nkristallos as another message. They were nowhere near Moonwood, but\nSabine\u2019s patrols took her all over the city.\nThe sting of the gun still bit into Bryce\u2019s palms, its kickback zinging\nalong her bones.\nThe medwitch removed her bloody gloves. A crackle of lightning at\nHunt\u2019s knuckles showed his returning power. \u201cThanks,\u201d he said to the\nwitch, who waved him off. Within a few seconds, she\u2019d packed the poison-\nswollen leeches in their jars and swept behind the magi-screens.\nHunt\u2019s stare met Bryce\u2019s. The ashes and busy officials and warriors\naround them faded away into white noise.\nNaomi approached, braid swaying behind her. \u201cWhy\u2019d it target you?\u201d\n\u201cEveryone wants to take a bite out of me,\u201d Hunt deflected.\nNaomi gave them both a look that told Bryce she didn\u2019t buy it for one\nsecond, but moved off to talk to a Fae female in the Aux.\nHunt tried to ease to his feet, and Bryce stepped in to offer a hand up.\nHe shook his head, grimacing as he braced a hand on his knee and rose. \u201cI\nguess we hit a nerve with Sabine,\u201d he said. \u201cShe must have figured out\nwe\u2019re onto her. This was either a warning like the club bombing or a failed\nattempt to take care of a problem like she did with the acolyte and guard.\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t answer. A wind drifted by, stirring the ashes.\n\u201cBryce.\u201d Hunt stepped closer, his dark eyes clear despite his injury.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d she whispered at last. \u201cYou\u2014we killed it\nso quickly.\u201d\nHunt didn\u2019t reply, giving her the space to think through it, to say it.\nShe said, \u201cDanika was strong. Connor was strong. Either one of them\ncould have taken on that demon and walked away. But the entire Pack of\nDevils was there that night. Even if its venom nullified some of their\npowers, the entire pack could have \u2026\u201d Her throat tightened.\n\u201cEven Mic\u2014\u201d Hunt caught himself, glancing toward the Archangel\nstill talking to commanders off to the side. \u201cHe didn\u2019t walk away from it.\u201d\n\u201cBut I did. Twice now.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s got some Fae weakness.\u201d\nShe shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. It just \u2026 it\u2019s not adding up.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll lay it all out tomorrow.\u201d Hunt nodded toward Micah. \u201cI think\ntonight just proved it\u2019s time to tell him our suspicions about Sabine.\u201d\nShe was going to be sick. But she nodded back.\nThey waited until most of Micah\u2019s commanders had peeled off on their\nvarious assignments before approaching, Hunt wincing with each step.\nHunt grunted, \u201cWe need to talk to you.\u201d\nMicah only crossed his arms. And then Hunt, briskly and efficiently,\ntold him. About the Horn, about Sabine, about their suspicions. About the\nHorn possibly being repaired\u2014though they still didn\u2019t know why she\u2019d\nwant or need to open a portal to another world.\nMicah\u2019s eyes went from annoyed to enraged to outright glacial.\nWhen Hunt was done, the Governor looked between them. \u201cYou need\nmore evidence.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get it,\u201d Hunt promised.\nMicah surveyed them, his face dark as the Pit. \u201cCome to me when you\nhave concrete proof. Or if you find that Horn. If someone\u2019s gone to so much\ntrouble over it, there\u2019s a damn good chance they\u2019ve found a way to repair it.\nI won\u2019t have this city endangered by a power-hungry bitch.\u201d Bryce could\nhave sworn the thorns tattooed across Hunt\u2019s brow darkened as his eyes met\nthe Archangel\u2019s. \u201cDon\u2019t fuck this up for me, Athalar.\u201d Without a further\nword, he flapped his wings and shot into the night sky.\nHunt blew out a breath, staring at the pile of ashes. \u201cPrick.\u201d\nBryce rubbed her hands over her arms. Hunt\u2019s eyes darted toward her,\nnoting the movement. The cold creeping over her that had nothing to do\nwith the spring night. Or the storm that was moments from unleashing\nitself.\n\u201cCome on,\u201d he said gently, rotating his injured arm to test its strength.\n\u201cI think I can manage flying us back to your place.\u201d\nShe surveyed the busy crew, the tracker shifters already moving off\ninto the trees to hunt for prints before the rain wiped them away. \u201cDon\u2019t we\nneed to answer questions?\u201d\nHe extended a hand. \u201cThey know where to find us.\u201d\nRuhn got to the night garden moments after his sister and Athalar left,\naccording to Naomi Boreas, captain of the 33rd\u2019s infantry. The take-no-shit\nangel had merely said both of them were fine, and pivoted to receive an\nupdate from a unit captain under her command.\nAll that was left of the kristallos was a burnt stain and a few sprayed\ndrops of clear blood, like beaded rainwater on the stones and moss.\nRuhn approached a carved boulder just off the path. Squatting, he\nfreed the knife in his boot and angled the blade toward a splash of the\nunusual blood clinging to some ancient moss.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d\nHe knew that fair voice\u2014its steady, calm cadence. He peered over his\nshoulder to find the medwitch from the clinic standing behind him, her\ncurly dark hair loose around her striking face. But her eyes were upon the\nblood. \u201cIts venom lies in its saliva,\u201d she said, \u201cbut we don\u2019t know what\nother horrors might be in the blood itself.\u201d\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t affected the moss,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYes, but this was a demon bred for specific purposes. Its blood might\nbe harmless to non-sentient life, but be dangerous to everything else.\u201d\nRuhn started. \u201cYou recognized the demon?\u201d\nThe witch blinked, as if she\u2019d been caught. \u201cI had very old tutors, as I\ntold you. They required me to study ancient texts.\u201d\nRuhn rose to his feet. \u201cWe could have used you years ago.\u201d\n\u201cI had not completed my training then.\u201d A nonanswer. Ruhn\u2019s brow\nfurrowed. The witch took a step back. \u201cI was thinking, Prince,\u201d she said,\ncontinuing her retreat. \u201cAbout what you asked me. I looked into it, and\nthere is some potential \u2026 research. I have to leave the city for a few days to\nattend to a personal matter, but when I return and fully review it, I will send\nit to you.\u201d\n\u201cRuhn!\u201d Flynn\u2019s shout cut through the chaos of the investigatory team\naround them.\nRuhn glanced over a shoulder to tell his friend to wait for two gods-\ndamned seconds, but motion from the witch caught his eye.\nHe hadn\u2019t seen the broom she\u2019d stashed beside the tree, but he\ncertainly saw it now as she shot into the night sky, her hair a dark curtain\nbehind her.\n\u201cWho was that?\u201d Flynn asked, nodding toward the vanishing witch.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Ruhn said quietly, staring after her into the night."}, "47": {"Name": "PART III THE CANYON-Chapter 47", "Page Content": " 7 \nThe storm hit when they were two blocks from Bryce\u2019s building, soaking\nthem within seconds.

Didn\u2019t care as he grazed his nose against the rain-slick column of her\nneck. Fuck, she smelled good.\nHe did it again, unable to help himself or get enough of that scent. She\ntipped her chin up slightly. Just enough to expose more of her neck to him.\nHel, yes. Hunt almost groaned the words as he let himself nuzzle into\nthat soft, delicious neck, as greedy as a fucking vampyr to be there, smell\nher, taste her.\nIt overrode every instinct, every pained memory, every vow he\u2019d\nsworn.\nBryce\u2019s fingers tightened on his back\u2014then began stroking.

Rain dripped off the narrow\nangles of her face as she seethed, \u201cYou think I killed my own daughter?\u201d\nBryce was shaking so hard that Hunt had to tighten his grip, and she\nsnapped, \u201cYou killed her because she was going to take your place as future\nPrime, you stole the Horn to undermine her, and you\u2019ve been using that\ndemon to kill anyone who might have seen you and to humiliate Micah\nbefore the Summit\u2014\u201d\nSabine laughed, low and hollow. \u201cWhat utter bullshit.\u201d\nHunt growled, \u201cYou wiped the footage of the Horn\u2019s theft from the\ntemple.

Ruhn\u2019s face appeared on the\ncamera feed, and Bryce let out a long, long sigh before silently buzzing him\nin.\nHunt rotated his stiff shoulder. His arm still throbbed a bit, an echo of\nthe lethal venom that had ripped his magic right from his body.\nThe prince\u2019s black boots appeared on the green carpeted steps seconds\nlater, apparently taking a hint about their location thanks to the open library\ndoor. Lehabah was instantly zooming across the space, sparks in her wake,\nas she beamed and said, \u201cYour Highness!\u201d\nRuhn offered her a half smile, his eyes going right to Quinlan. They\nmissed none of the quiet, brooding exhaustion. Or the tone in Bryce\u2019s voice\nas she said, \u201cTo what do we owe this pleasure?\u201d\nRuhn slid into a seat across from them at the book-strewn table. The\nStarsword sheathed down his back didn\u2019t reflect the lights in the library. \u201cI\nwanted to check in. Anything new?\u201d\nNeither of them had told him about Sabine. And apparently Declan\nhadn\u2019t, either.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Bryce said. \u201cAnything about the Horn?\u201d\nRuhn ignored her question. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201cNothing.\u201d Her spine stiffened.\nRuhn looked ready to get into it with his cousin, so Hunt did both of\nthem\u2014and himself, if he was being honest\u2014a favor and said, \u201cWe\u2019ve been\nwaiting on a Many Waters contact to get back to us about a possible pattern\nwith the demon attacks. Have you come across any information about the\nkristallos negating magic?\u201d Days later, he couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it\u2014\nhow it\u2019d felt for his power to just sputter and die in his veins.\n\u201cNo. I still haven\u2019t found anything about the creation of the kristallos\nexcept that it was made from the blood of the first Starborn Prince and the\nessence of the Star-Eater himself. Nothing about it negating magic.\u201d Ruhn\nnodded at him. \u201cYou\u2019ve never come across a demon that can do that?\u201d\n\u201cNot one. Witch spells and gorsian stones negate magic, but this was\ndifferent.\u201d He\u2019d dealt with both. Before they\u2019d bound him using the witch-\nink on his brow, they\u2019d shackled him with manacles hewn from the gorsian\nstones of the Dolos Mountains, a rare metal whose properties numbed one\u2019s\naccess to magic. They were used on high-profile enemies of the empire\u2014\nthe Hind herself was particularly fond of using them as she and her\ninterrogators broke the Vanir among the rebel spies and leaders. But for\nyears now, rumors had swirled in the 33rd\u2019s barracks that rebels were\nexperimenting with ways to render the metal into a spray that could be\nunleashed upon Vanir warriors on the battlefields.\nRuhn motioned to the ancient book he\u2019d left on the table days ago, still\nopen to a passage about the Starborn Fae. \u201cIf the Star-Eater himself put his\nessence in the kristallos, that\u2019s probably what gave the demon the ability to\neat magic. Just as Prince Pelias\u2019s blood gave it the ability to look for the\nHorn.\u201d\nBryce frowned. \u201cSo that Chosen One sense of yours hasn\u2019t detected a\ntrace of the Horn?\u201d\nRuhn tugged at the silver ring through his bottom lip. \u201cNo. But I got a\nmessage this morning from a medwitch I met the other day\u2014the one who\nstitched up Hunt in the night garden. It\u2019s a shot in the dark, but she\nmentioned that there\u2019s a relatively new drug on the market that\u2019s just\nstarting to come into use. It\u2019s a synthetic healing magic.\u201d Hunt and Bryce\nstraightened. \u201cIt can have some wicked side effects if not carefully\ncontrolled. She didn\u2019t have access to its exact formula or the trials, but she\nsaid research showed it capable of healing at rates nearly double that of\nfirstlight.\u201d\nBryce said, \u201cYou think something like that could repair the Horn?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a possibility. It\u2019d fit with that stupid riddle about light that\u2019s not\nlight, magic that\u2019s not magic repairing the Horn. That\u2019s kind of what a\nsynthetic compound like that is.\u201d\nHer eyes flickered. \u201cAnd it\u2019s \u2026 readily available?\u201d\n\u201cIt entered the market at some point in the past few years, apparently.\nNo one has tested it on inanimate objects, but who knows? If real magic\ncouldn\u2019t heal it, maybe a synthetic compound could.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of synthetic magic,\u201d Hunt said.\n\u201cNeither have I,\u201d Ruhn admitted.\n\u201cSo we have a potential way to repair the Horn,\u201d Bryce mused, \u201cbut\nnot the Horn itself.\u201d She sighed. \u201cAnd we still don\u2019t know if Danika stole\nthe Horn on a lark or for some actual purpose.\u201d\nRuhn started. \u201cDanika did what?\u201d\nBryce winced, then filled the prince in on all they\u2019d learned. When she\nfinished, Ruhn leaned back in his chair, shock written on every line of his\nface.\nHunt said into the silence, \u201cRegardless of whether Danika stole the\nHorn for fun or to do something with it, the fact remains that she stole it.\u201d\nRuhn asked carefully, \u201cDo you think she wanted it for herself? To\nrepair it and use it?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Bryce said quietly. \u201cNo, Danika might have kept things from\nme, but I knew her heart. She never would have sought a weapon as\ndangerous as the Horn\u2014something that could jeopardize the world like\nthat.\u201d She ran her hands over her face. \u201cHer killer is still out there. Danika\nmust have taken the Horn to keep them from getting it. They killed her for\nit, but they must not have found it, if they\u2019re still using the kristallos to\nsearch for it.\u201d She waved a hand at Ruhn\u2019s sword. \u201cThat thing can\u2019t help\nyou find it? I still think luring the killer with the Horn is probably the most\nsurefire way to find them.\u201d\nRuhn shook his head. \u201cThe sword doesn\u2019t work like that. Aside from\nbeing picky about who draws it, the sword has no power without the knife.\u201d\n\u201cThe knife?\u201d Hunt asked.\nRuhn drew the sword, the metal whining, and laid it on the table\nbetween them. Bryce leaned back, away from it, as a bead of starlight sang\ndown the fuller and sparkled at the tip.\n\u201cFancy,\u201d Hunt said, earning a glare from Ruhn, who had raised a brow\nat Bryce, no doubt expecting some kind of reverence from her at a sword\nthat was older than this city, older than the Vanir\u2019s first step in Midgard.\n\u201cThe sword was part of a pair,\u201d Ruhn said to him. \u201cA long-bladed\nknife was forged from the iridium mined from the same meteorite, which\nfell on our old world.\u201d The world the Fae had left to travel through the\nNorthern Rift and into Midgard. \u201cBut we lost the knife eons ago. Even the\nFae Archives have no record of how it might have been lost, but it seems to\nhave been sometime during the First Wars.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s another of the Fae\u2019s countless inane prophecies,\u201d Bryce muttered.\n\u201cWhen knife and sword are reunited, so shall our people be.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s literally carved above the Fae Archives entrance\u2014whatever the\nfuck it means,\u201d Ruhn said. Bryce gave a small smile at that.\nHunt grinned. Her little smile was like seeing the sun after days of\nrain.\nBryce pretended not to notice his grin, but Ruhn gave him a sharp\nlook.\nLike he knew every filthy thing Hunt had thought about Bryce,\neverything he\u2019d done to pleasure himself while imagining it was her mouth\naround him, her hands, her soft body.\nShit\u2014he was in such deep, unrelenting shit.\nRuhn only snorted, as if he knew that, too, and sheathed the sword\nagain.\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see the Fae Archives,\u201d Lehabah sighed. \u201cThink of all that\nancient history, all those glorious objects.\u201d\n\u201cKept locked away, only for their pure-blooded heirs to see,\u201d Bryce\nfinished with a pointed glance at Ruhn.\nRuhn held up his hands. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to get them to change the rules,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cNo luck.\u201d\n\u201cThey let in visitors on the major holidays,\u201d Lehabah said.\n\u201cOnly from an approved list,\u201d Bryce said. \u201cAnd fire sprites are not on\nit.\u201d\nLehabah rolled over onto her side, propping her head up with a fiery\nhand. \u201cThey would let me in. I am a descendent of Queen Ranthia Drahl.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, and I\u2019m the seventh Asteri,\u201d Bryce said dryly.\nHunt was careful not to react at the tone. The first bit of spark he\u2019d\nseen in days.\n\u201cI am,\u201d Lehabah insisted, turning to Ruhn. \u201cShe was my six-times-\ngreat-grandmother, dethroned in the Elemental Wars. Our family was cast\nfrom favor\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThe story changes every time,\u201d Bryce told Hunt, whose lips twitched.\n\u201cIt does not,\u201d Lehabah whined. Ruhn was smiling now, too. \u201cWe stood\na chance at earning back our title, but my great-great-grandmother was\nbooted from the Eternal City for\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBooted.\u201d\n\u201cYes, booted. For a completely false accusation of trying to steal the\nroyal consort from the impostor queen. She\u2019d be thrashing in her ashes if\nshe knew what had become of her last scion. Little more than a bird in a\ncage.\u201d\nBryce sipped from her water. \u201cThis is the point, boys, where she\nsolicits you for cash to purchase her freedom.\u201d\nLehabah turned crimson. \u201cThat is not true.\u201d She pointed her finger at\nBryce. \u201cMy great-grandmother fought with Hunt against the angels\u2014and\nthat was the end of my entire people\u2019s freedom.\u201d\nThe words cracked through Hunt. All of them looked at him now. \u201cI\u2019m\nsorry.\u201d He had no other words in his head.\n\u201cOh, Athie,\u201d Lehabah said, zooming over to him and turning rose pink.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to \u2026\u201d She cupped her cheeks in her hands. \u201cI do not blame\nyou.\u201d\n\u201cI led everyone into battle. I don\u2019t see how there\u2019s anyone else to\nblame for what happened to your people because of it.\u201d His words sounded\nas hollow as they felt.\n\u201cBut Shahar led you,\u201d Danaan said, his blue eyes missing nothing.\nHunt bristled at the sound of her name on the prince\u2019s lips. But he\nfound himself looking to Quinlan, to torture himself with the damning\nagreement he\u2019d find on her face.\nOnly sorrow lay there. And something like understanding. Like she\nsaw him, as he\u2019d seen her in that shooting gallery, marked every broken\nshard and didn\u2019t mind the jagged bits. Under the table, the toe of her high\nheel brushed against his boot. A little confirmation that yes\u2014she saw his\nguilt, the pain, and she wouldn\u2019t shy from it. His chest tightened.\nLehabah cleared her throat and asked Ruhn, \u201cHave you ever visited the\nFae Archives on Avallen? I heard they\u2019re grander than what was brought\nover here.\u201d She twirled her curl of flame around a finger.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Ruhn said. \u201cBut the Fae on that misty island are even less\nwelcoming than the ones here.\u201d\n\u201cThey do like to hoard all their wealth, don\u2019t they,\u201d Lehabah said,\neyeing Bryce. \u201cJust like you, BB. Only spending on yourself, and never\nanything nice for me.\u201d\nBryce removed her foot. \u201cDo I not buy you strawberry shisha every\nother week?\u201d\nLehabah crossed her arms. \u201cThat\u2019s barely a gift.\u201d\n\u201cSays the sprite who hotboxes herself in that little glass dome and\nburns it all night and tells me not to bother her until she\u2019s done.\u201d She leaned\nback in her chair, smug as a cat, and Hunt nearly grinned again at the spark\nin her eyes.\nBryce grabbed his phone from the table and snapped a photo of him\nbefore he could object. Then one of Lehabah. And another of Syrinx.\nIf Ruhn noticed she didn\u2019t bother with a photo of him, he said nothing.\nThough Hunt could have sworn the shadows in the room deepened.\n\u201cAll I want, BB,\u201d Lehabah said, \u201cis a little appreciation.\u201d\n\u201cGods spare me,\u201d Bryce muttered. Even Ruhn smiled at that.\nThe prince\u2019s phone rang, and he picked up before Hunt could see who\nit was. \u201cFlynn.\u201d\nHunt heard Flynn\u2019s voice faintly. \u201cYou\u2019re needed at the barracks.\nSome bullshit fight broke out about somebody\u2019s girlfriend sleeping with\nsomeone else and I honestly don\u2019t give two fucks about it, but they bloodied\neach other up pretty damn good.\u201d\nRuhn sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll be there in fifteen,\u201d he said, and hung up.\nHunt asked, \u201cYou really have to moderate petty fights like that?\u201d\nRuhn ran a hand down the hilt of the Starsword. \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a prince.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why you make that sound like an insult,\u201d Ruhn\ngrowled.\nHunt said, \u201cWhy not do \u2026 bigger shit?\u201d\nBryce answered for him. \u201cBecause his daddy is scared of him.\u201d\nRuhn shot her a warning look. \u201cHe outranks me power-wise and title-\nwise.\u201d\n\u201cAnd yet he made sure to get you under his thumb as early as possible\n\u2014as if you were some sort of animal to be tamed.\u201d She said the words\nmildly, but Ruhn tensed.\n\u201cIt was going well,\u201d Ruhn said tightly, \u201cuntil you came along.\u201d\nHunt braced himself for the brewing storm.\nBryce said, \u201cHe was alive the last time a Starborn Prince appeared,\nyou know. You ever ask what happened to him? Why he died before he\nmade the Drop?\u201d\nRuhn paled. \u201cDon\u2019t be stupid. That was an accident during his\nOrdeal.\u201d\nHunt kept his face neutral, but Bryce just leaned back in her chair. \u201cIf\nyou say so.\u201d\n\u201cYou still believe this shit you tried to sell me as a kid?\u201d\nShe crossed her arms. \u201cI wanted your eyes open to what he really is\nbefore it was too late for you, too.\u201d\nRuhn blinked, but straightened, shaking his head as he rose from the\ntable. \u201cTrust me, Bryce, I\u2019ve known for a while what he is. I had to fucking\nlive with him.\u201d Ruhn nodded toward the messy table. \u201cIf I hear anything\nnew about the Horn or this synthetic healing magic, I\u2019ll let you know.\u201d He\nmet Hunt\u2019s stare and added, \u201cBe careful.\u201d\nHunt gave him a half smile that told the prince he knew exactly what\nthat be careful was about. And didn\u2019t give a shit.\nTwo minutes after Ruhn left, the front door buzzed again.\n\u201cWhat does he fucking want now?\u201d Bryce muttered, grabbing the\ntablet Lehabah had been using to watch her trash TV and pulling up the\nvideo feed for the front cameras.\nA squeal escaped her. An otter in a reflective yellow vest stood on its\nhind legs, a little paw on the lower buzzer she\u2019d had Jesiba install for\nshorter patrons. Out of the hope that one day, somehow, she\u2019d find a fuzzy,\nwhiskery messenger standing on the doorstep.\nBryce bolted from her chair a second later, her heels eating up the\ncarpet as she ran upstairs.\nThe message the otter bore from Tharion was short and sweet.\nI think you\u2019ll find this of interest. Kisses, Tharion\n\u201cKisses?\u201d Hunt asked.\n\u201cThey\u2019re for you, obviously,\u201d Bryce said, still smiling about the otter.\nShe\u2019d handed him a silver mark, for which she\u2019d earned a twitch of the\nwhiskers and a little fanged grin.\nEasily the highlight of her day. Week. Year.\nHonestly, her entire life.\nAt the desk in the showroom, Bryce removed Tharion\u2019s letter from the\ntop of the pile, while Hunt began to leaf through some of the pages beneath.\nThe blood rushed from her face at a photograph in Hunt\u2019s hand. \u201cIs\nthat a body?\u201d\nHunt grunted. \u201cIt\u2019s what\u2019s left of one after Tharion pried it from a\nsobek\u2019s lair.\u201d\nBryce couldn\u2019t stop the shudder down her spine. Clocking in at more\nthan twenty-five feet and nearly three thousand pounds of scale-covered\nmuscle, sobeks were among the worst of the apex predators who prowled\nthe river. Mean, strong, and with teeth that could snap you in two, a full-\ngrown male sobek could make most Vanir back away. \u201cHe\u2019s insane.\u201d\nHunt chuckled. \u201cOh, he most certainly is.\u201d\nBryce frowned at the gruesome photo, then read through Tharion\u2019s\nnotes. \u201cHe says the bite marks on the torso aren\u2019t consistent with sobek\nteeth. This person was already dead when they were dumped into the Istros.\nThe sobek must have seen an easy meal and hauled it down to its lair to eat\nlater.\u201d She swallowed the dryness in her mouth and again looked at the\nbody. A dryad female. Her chest cavity had been ripped open, heart and\ninternal organs removed, and bite marks peppered\u2014\n\u201cThese wounds look like the ones you got from the kristallos. And the\nmer\u2019s lab figured this body was probably five days old, judging by the level\nof decay.\u201d\n\u201cThe night we were attacked.\u201d\nBryce studied the analysis. \u201cThere was clear venom in the wounds.\nTharion says he could feel it inside the corpse even before the mer did tests\non it.\u201d Most of those in the House of Many Waters could sense what flowed\nin someone\u2019s body\u2014illnesses and weaknesses and, apparently, venom. \u201cBut\nwhen they tested it \u2026\u201d She blew out a breath. \u201cIt negated magic.\u201d It had to\nbe the kristallos. Bryce cringed, reading on, \u201cHe looked into records of all\nunidentified bodies the mer found in the past couple years. They found two\nwith identical wounds and this clear venom right around the time of \u2026\u201d\nShe swallowed. \u201cAround when Danika and the pack died. A dryad and a fox\nshifter male. Both reported missing. This month, they\u2019ve found five with\nthese marks and the venom. All reported missing, but a few weeks after the\nfact.\u201d\n\u201cSo they\u2019re people who might not have had many close friends or\nfamily,\u201d Hunt said.\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d Bryce again studied the photograph. Made herself look at\nthe wounds. Silence fell, interrupted only by the distant sounds of\nLehabah\u2019s show downstairs.\nShe said quietly, \u201cThat\u2019s not the creature that killed Danika.\u201d\nHunt ran a hand through his hair. \u201cThere might have been multiple\nkristallos\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d she insisted, setting down the papers. \u201cThe kristallos isn\u2019t what\nkilled Danika.\u201d\nHunt\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cYou were on the scene, though. You saw it.\u201d\n\u201cI saw it in the hall, not in the apartment. Danika, the pack, and the\nother three recent victims were in piles.\u201d She could barely stand to say it, to\nthink about it again.\nThese past five days had been \u2026 not easy. Putting one foot in front of\nthe other had been the only thing to get her through it after the disaster with\nSabine. After the bomb she\u2019d dropped about Danika. And if they\u2019d been\nlooking for the wrong fucking thing all this time \u2026\nBryce held up the photo. \u201cThese wounds aren\u2019t the same. The\nkristallos wanted to get at your heart, your organs. Not turn you into a\u2014a\nheap. Danika, the Pack of Devils, Tertian, the acolyte and temple guard\u2014\nnone of them had wounds like this. And none had this venom in their\nsystem.\u201d Hunt just blinked at her. Bryce\u2019s voice cracked. \u201cWhat if\nsomething else came through? What if the kristallos was summoned to look\nfor the Horn, but something worse was also there that night? If you had the\npower to summon the kristallos, why not summon multiple types of\ndemons?\u201d\nHunt considered. \u201cI can\u2019t think of a demon that demolishes its victims\nlike that, though. Unless it\u2019s another ancient horror straight from the Pit.\u201d\nHe rubbed his neck. \u201cIf the kristallos killed this dryad\u2014killed these people\nwhose bodies washed into the river through the sewers\u2014then why summon\ntwo kinds of demons? The kristallos is already lethal as Hel.\u201d Literally.\nBryce threw up her hands. \u201cI have no idea. But if everything we know\nabout Danika\u2019s death is wrong, then we need to figure out how she died. We\nneed someone who can weigh in.\u201d\nHe rubbed his jaw. \u201cAny ideas?\u201d\nShe nodded slowly, dread curling in her gut. \u201cPromise me you won\u2019t\ngo ballistic.\u201d"}, "51": {"Name": "PART III THE CANYON-Chapter 51", "Page Content": " 1 \n\u201cSummoning a demon is a bad fucking idea,\u201d Hunt breathed as night fell\nbeyond the apartment\u2019s shut curtains. \u201cEspecially considering that\u2019s what\nstarted this mess in the first place.\u201d\nThey stood in her great room, lights dimmed and candles flickering\naround them, Syrinx bundled in blankets and locked in his crate in Bryce\u2019s\nbedroom, surrounded by a protective circle of white salt.\nWhat lay around and before them on the pale floors, reeking of mold\nand rotten earth, was the opposite of that.\nBryce had ground the block of obsidian salt down at some point\u2014\npresumably using her fucking food processor. For something she\u2019d dropped\nten grand on, Bryce didn\u2019t treat it with any particular reverence. She\u2019d\nchucked it into a kitchen cabinet as if it were a bag of chips.\nHe hadn\u2019t realized she\u2019d only been biding her time until she needed it.\nNow, she\u2019d crafted two circles with the obsidian salt. The one near the\nwindows was perhaps five feet in diameter. The other was big enough to\nhold herself and Hunt.\nBryce said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to waste my time snooping around town for\nanswers about what kind of demon killed Danika. Going right to the source\nwill save me a headache.\u201d\n\u201cGoing right to the source will get you splattered on a wall. And if not,\narrested for summoning a demon into a residential zone.\u201d Shit. He should\narrest her, shouldn\u2019t he?\n\u201cNo one likes a narc, Athalar.\u201d\n\u201cI am a narc.\u201d\nA dark red eyebrow arched. \u201cCould\u2019ve fooled me, Shadow of Death.\u201d\nShe joined him in the salt circle. Her long ponytail pooled in the collar of\nher leather jacket, the candlelight gilding the red strands.\nHis fingers twitched, as if they\u2019d reach for that silken length of hair.\nRun it between them. Wrap it around his fist and draw her head back,\nexposing that neck of hers again to his mouth. His tongue. Teeth.\nHunt growled, \u201cYou do know that it is my job to stop these demons\nfrom entering this world.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re not setting the demon loose,\u201d she hissed back. \u201cThis is as safe\nas a phone call.\u201d\n\u201cAre you going to summon it with its unholy number, then?\u201d Many\ndemons had numbers associated with them, like some sort of ancient email\naddress.\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t need it. I know how to find this demon.\u201d He started to\nanswer, but she cut him off. \u201cThe obsidian salt will hold it.\u201d\nHunt eyed the circles she\u2019d made, then sighed. Fine. Even though\narguing with her was nearly as enticing as foreplay, he didn\u2019t feel like\nwasting time, either.\nBut then the temperature in the room began to drop. Rapidly.\nAnd as Hunt\u2019s breath began to cloud the air, as a humanoid male\nappeared, thrumming with dark power that made his stomach roil \u2026\nBryce grinned up at Hunt as his heart stopped dead. \u201cSurprise.\u201d\nShe\u2019d lost her fucking mind. He would kill her for this\u2014if they weren\u2019t\nboth killed in the next few seconds.\n\u201cWho is that?\u201d Ice formed in the room. No clothing could protect\nagainst the cold this demon brought with him. It pierced through every\nlayer, snatching the breath from Hunt\u2019s chest with clawed fingers. A\nshuddering inhale was the only sign of Bryce\u2019s discomfort as she remained\nfacing the circle on the other side of the room. The male now contained\ninside its dark border.\n\u201cAidas,\u201d she said softly.\nHunt had always imagined the Prince of the Chasm as similar to the\nlower-level demons he\u2019d hunted over the centuries: scales or fangs or claws,\nbrute muscle and snarling with blind animal rage.\nNot this slender, pale-skinned \u2026 pretty boy.\nAidas\u2019s blond hair fell to his shoulders in soft waves, loose, yet well\ncut around his fine-boned face. Undoubtedly to show off the eyes like blue\nopals, framed by thick, golden lashes. Those lashes bobbed once in a\ncursory blink. Then his full, sensuous mouth parted in a smile to reveal a\nrow of too-white teeth. \u201cBryce Quinlan.\u201d\nHunt\u2019s hand drifted to his gun. The Prince of the Chasm knew her\nname\u2014her face. And the way he\u2019d spoken her name was as much greeting\nas it was question, his voice velvet-soft.\nAidas occupied the fifth level of Hel\u2014the Chasm. He yielded only to\ntwo others: the Prince of the Abyss, and the Prince of the Pit, the seventh\nand mightiest of the demon princes. The Star-Eater himself, whose name\nwas never uttered on this side of the Northern Rift.\nNo one would dare say his name, not after the Prince of the Pit became\nthe first and only being to ever kill an Asteri. His butchering of the seventh\nholy star\u2014Sirius, the Wolf Star\u2014during the First Wars remained a favorite\nballad around war-camp fires. And what he\u2019d done to Sirius after slaying\nher had earned him that awful title: Star-Eater.\n\u201cYou appeared as a cat the last time\u201d was all Bryce said.\nAll. She. Said.\nHunt dared take his eyes off the Prince of the Chasm to find Bryce\nbowing her head.\nAidas slid his slender hands into the pockets of his closely tailored\njacket and pants\u2014the material blacker than the Chasm in which he resided.\n\u201cYou were very young then.\u201d\nHunt had to plant his feet to keep from swaying. She\u2019d met the prince\nbefore\u2014how?\nHis shock must have been written on his face because she shot him a\nlook that he could only interpret as Calm the fuck down, but said, \u201cI was\nthirteen\u2014not that young.\u201d\nHunt reined in his grunt that would have suggested otherwise.\nAidas tilted his head to one side. \u201cYou were very sad then as well.\u201d\nIt took Hunt a moment to process it\u2014the words. The bit of history, and\nthe bit of now.\nBryce rubbed her hands together. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about you, Your\nHighness.\u201d\n\u201cI am always happy to do so.\u201d\nThe cold burned Hunt\u2019s lungs. They could last only minutes at this\ntemperature before their healing abilities started churning. And despite\nBryce\u2019s Fae blood, there was a good chance that she might not recover at\nall. Without having made the Drop, the frostbite would be permanent for\nBryce. As would any digits or limbs lost.\nShe said to the demon prince, \u201cYou and your colleagues seem to be\ngetting restless in the dark.\u201d\n\u201cIs that so?\u201d Aidas frowned at his polished leather shoes as if he could\nsee all the way down to the Pit. \u201cPerhaps you summoned the wrong prince,\nfor this is the first I\u2019ve heard of it.\u201d\n\u201cWho is summoning the kristallos demon to hunt through this city?\u201d\nFlat, cutting words. \u201cAnd what killed Danika Fendyr?\u201d\n\u201cAh yes, we heard of that\u2014how Danika screamed as she was shredded\napart.\u201d\nBryce\u2019s beat of silence told Hunt enough about the internal wound that\nAidas had pressed. From the smile gracing Aidas\u2019s face, the Prince of the\nChasm knew it as well.\nShe went on, \u201cDo you know what demon did it?\u201d\n\u201cDespite what your mythologies claim, I am not privy to the\nmovements of every being in Hel.\u201d\nShe said tightly, \u201cDo you know, though? Or know who summoned it?\u201d\nHis golden lashes shimmered as he blinked. \u201cYou believe I dispatched\nit?\u201d\n\u201cYou would not be standing there if I did.\u201d\nAidas laughed softly. \u201cNo tears from you this time.\u201d\nBryce smiled slightly. \u201cYou told me not to let them see me cry. I took\nthe advice to heart.\u201d\nWhat the Hel had gone on during that meeting twelve years ago?\n\u201cInformation is not free.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is your price?\u201d A bluish tint crept over her lips. They\u2019d have to\ncut the connection soon.\nHunt kept perfectly still as Aidas studied her. Then his eyes registered\nHunt.\nHe blinked\u2014once. As if he had not really marked his presence until\nthis moment. As if he hadn\u2019t cared to notice, with Bryce before him. Hunt\ntucked away that fact, just as Aidas murmured, \u201cWho are you.\u201d\nA command.\n\u201cHe\u2019s eye candy,\u201d Bryce said, looping her arm through Hunt\u2019s and\npressing close. For warmth or steadiness, he didn\u2019t know. She was shaking.\n\u201cAnd he is not for sale.\u201d She pointed to the halo across Hunt\u2019s brow.\n\u201cMy pets like to rip out feathers\u2014it would be a good trade.\u201d\nHunt leveled a stare at the prince. Bryce threw Hunt a sidelong glare,\nthe effect of which was negated by her chattering teeth.\nAidas smiled, looking him over again. \u201cA Fallen warrior with the\npower of \u2026\u201d Aidas\u2019s groomed brows lifted in surprise. His blue opal eyes\nnarrowed to slits\u2014then simmered like the hottest flame. \u201cWhat are you\ndoing with a black crown around your brow?\u201d\nHunt didn\u2019t dare let his surprise at the question show. He\u2019d never heard\nit called that before\u2014a black crown. Halo, witch-ink, mark-of-shame, but\nnever that.\nAidas looked between them now. Carefully. He didn\u2019t bother to let\nHunt answer his question before that awful smile returned. \u201cThe seven\nprinces dwell in darkness and do not stir. We have no interest in your\nrealm.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d believe it if you and your brethren hadn\u2019t been rattling the\nNorthern Rift for the past two decades,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cAnd if I hadn\u2019t been\ncleaning up after it.\u201d\nAidas sucked in a breath, as if tasting the air on which Hunt\u2019s words\nhad been delivered to him. \u201cYou do realize that it might not be my people?\nThe Northern Rift opens to other places\u2014other realms, yes, but other\nplanets as well. What is Hel but a distant planet bound to yours by a ripple\nin space and time?\u201d\n\u201cHel is a planet?\u201d Hunt\u2019s brows lowered. Most of the demons he\u2019d\nkilled and dealt with hadn\u2019t been able to or inclined to speak.\nAidas shrugged with one shoulder. \u201cIt is as real a place as Midgard,\nthough most of us would have you believe it wasn\u2019t.\u201d The prince pointed to\nhim. \u201cYour kind, Fallen, were made in Midgard by the Asteri. But the Fae,\nthe shifters, and many others came from their own worlds. The universe is\nmassive. Some believe it has no end. Or that our universe might be one in a\nmultitude, as bountiful as the stars in the sky or the sand on a beach.\u201d\nBryce threw Hunt a look that told him she, too, was wondering what\nthe Hel the demon prince was smoking in the Chasm. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to\ndistract us,\u201d Bryce said, arms crossing. Hoarfrost crept across the floors.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not rattling the Northern Rift?\u201d\n\u201cThe lesser princes do that\u2014levels one through four,\u201d Aidas said, head\nangling again. \u201cThose of us in the true dark have no need or interest in\nsunshine. But even they did not send the kristallos. Our plans do not involve\nsuch things.\u201d\nHunt growled, \u201cYour kind wanted to live here, once upon a time. Why\nwould that change?\u201d\nAidas chuckled. \u201cIt is dreadfully amusing to hear the stories the Asteri\nhave spun for you.\u201d He smiled at Bryce. \u201cWhat blinds an Oracle?\u201d\nAll color leached from Bryce\u2019s face at the mention of her visit to the\nOracle. How Aidas knew about it, Hunt could only guess, but she\ncountered, \u201cWhat sort of cat visits an Oracle?\u201d\n\u201cWinning first words.\u201d Aidas slid his hands into his pockets again. \u201cI\ndid not know what you might prefer now that you are grown.\u201d A smirk at\nHunt. \u201cBut I may appear more like that, if it pleases you, Bryce Quinlan.\u201d\n\u201cBetter yet: don\u2019t appear again at all,\u201d Hunt said to the demon prince.\nBryce squeezed his arm. He stepped on her foot hard enough to get her\nto cut it out.\nBut Aidas chuckled. \u201cYour temperature drops. I shall depart.\u201d\n\u201cPlease,\u201d Bryce said. \u201cJust tell me if you know what killed Danika.\nPlease.\u201d\nA soft laugh. \u201cRun the tests again. Find what is in-between.\u201d\nHe began to fade, as if a phone call were indeed breaking up.\n\u201cAidas,\u201d she blurted, stepping right to the edge of their circle. Hunt\nfought the urge to tuck her to his side. Especially as darkness frayed the\nedges of Aidas\u2019s body. \u201cThank you. For that day.\u201d\nThe Prince of the Chasm paused, as if clinging to this world. \u201cMake\nthe Drop, Bryce Quinlan.\u201d He flickered. \u201cAnd find me when you are done.\u201d\nAidas had nearly vanished into nothing when he added, the words a\nghost slithering through the room, \u201cThe Oracle did not see. But I did.\u201d\nSilence pulsed in his wake as the room thawed, frost vanishing.\nHunt whirled on Bryce. \u201cFirst of all,\u201d he seethed, \u201cfuck you for that\nsurprise.\u201d\nShe rubbed her hands together, working warmth back into them. \u201cYou\nnever would have let me summon Aidas if I\u2019d told you first.\u201d\n\u201cBecause we should be fucking dead right now!\u201d He gaped at her.\n\u201cAre you insane?\u201d\n\u201cI knew he wouldn\u2019t hurt me. Or anyone with me.\u201d\n\u201cYou want to tell me how you met Aidas when you were thirteen?\u201d\n\u201cI \u2026 I told you how badly things ended between me and my biological\nfather after my Oracle visit.\u201d His anger banked at the lingering pain in her\nface. \u201cSo afterward, when I was crying my little heart out on one of the park\nbenches outside the temple, this white cat appeared next to me. It had the\nmost unnatural blue eyes. I knew, even before it spoke, that it wasn\u2019t a cat\n\u2014and wasn\u2019t a shifter.\u201d\n\u201cWho summoned him that time?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Jesiba told me that the princes can sneak through cracks\nin either Rift, taking the form of common animals. But then they\u2019re\nconfined to those forms\u2014with none of their own power, save the ability to\nspeak. And they can only stay for a few hours at a time.\u201d\nA shudder worked its way down his gray wings. \u201cWhat did Aidas\nsay?\u201d\n\u201cHe asked me: What blinds an Oracle? And I replied: What sort of cat\nvisits an Oracle? He\u2019d heard the screaming on his way in. I suppose it\nintrigued him. He told me to stop crying. Said it would only satisfy those\nwho had wronged me. That I shouldn\u2019t give them the gift of my sorrow.\u201d\n\u201cWhy was the Prince of the Chasm at the Oracle?\u201d\n\u201cHe never told me. But he sat with me until I worked up the nerve to\nwalk back to my father\u2019s house. By the time I remembered to thank him, he\nwas gone.\u201d\n\u201cStrange.\u201d And\u2014fine, he could understand why she hadn\u2019t balked\nfrom summoning him, if he\u2019d been kind to her in the past.\n\u201cPerhaps some of the feline body wore off on him and he was merely\ncurious about me.\u201d\n\u201cApparently, he\u2019s missed you.\u201d A leading question.\n\u201cApparently,\u201d she hedged. \u201cThough he barely gave us anything to go\non.\u201d\nHer gaze turned distant as she looked at the empty circle before them,\nthen took her phone out of her pocket. Hunt caught a glimpse of who she\ndialed\u2014Declan Emmet.\n\u201cHi, B.\u201d In the background, music thumped and male laughter roared.\nBryce didn\u2019t bother with niceties. \u201cWe\u2019ve been tipped off that we\nshould run various tests again\u2014I\u2019m assuming that means the ones on the\nvictims and crime scenes a few years ago. Can you think of anything that\nshould be reexamined?\u201d\nIn the background, Ruhn asked, Is that Bryce? But Declan said, \u201cI\u2019d\ndefinitely run a scent diagnostic. You\u2019ll need clothes.\u201d\nBryce said, \u201cThey must have done a scent diagnostic two years ago.\u201d\nDeclan said, \u201cWas it the common one, or the Mimir?\u201d\nHunt\u2019s stomach tightened. Especially as Bryce said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the\ndifference?\u201d\n\u201cThe Mimir is better. It\u2019s relatively new.\u201d\nBryce looked at Hunt, and he shook his head slowly. She said quietly\ninto the phone, \u201cNo one did a Mimir test.\u201d\nDeclan hesitated. \u201cWell \u2026 it\u2019s Fae tech mostly. We loan it out to the\nlegion for their major cases.\u201d A pause. \u201cSomeone should have said\nsomething.\u201d\nHunt braced himself. Bryce asked, \u201cYou had access to this sort of thing\ntwo years ago?\u201d\nDeclan paused again. \u201cAh\u2014shit.\u201d Then Ruhn came on the line.\n\u201cBryce, a direct order was given not to pursue it through those channels. It\nwas deemed a matter that the Fae should stay out of.\u201d\nDevastation, rage, grief\u2014all exploded across her face. Her fingers\ncurled at her sides.\nHunt said, knowing Ruhn could hear it, \u201cThe Autumn King is a real\nprick, you know that?\u201d\nBryce snarled, \u201cI\u2019m going to tell him just that.\u201d She hung up.\nHunt demanded, \u201cWhat?\u201d But she was already running out of the\napartment."}, "52": {"Name": "PART III THE CANYON-Chapter 52", "Page Content": " 2 \nBryce\u2019s blood roared as she sprinted through the Old Square, down rain-\nsoaked streets, all the way to Five Roses. The villas glowed in the rain,\npalatial homes with immaculate lawns and gardens, all fenced with wrought\niron. Stone-faced Fae or shifter sentries from the Auxiliary were posted at\nevery corner.\nAs if the residents here lived in abject terror that the peregrini and few\nslaves of Crescent City were poised to loot at any moment.\nShe hurtled past the marble behemoth that was the Fae Archives, the\nbuilding covered in drooping veils of flowers that ran down its many\ncolumns. Roses, jasmine, wisteria\u2014all in perpetual bloom, no matter the\nseason.\nShe sprinted all the way to the sprawling white villa covered in pink\nroses, and to the wrought-iron gate around it guarded by four Fae warriors.\nThey stepped into her path as she skidded to a halt, the flagstone street\nslick with rain.\n\u201cLet me in,\u201d she said through her teeth, panting.\nThey didn\u2019t so much as blink. \u201cDo you have an appointment with His\nMajesty?\u201d one asked.\n\u201cLet me in,\u201d she said again.\nHe\u2019d known. Her father had known there were tests to assess what had\nkilled Danika and had done nothing. Had deliberately stayed out of it.\nShe had to see him. Had to hear it from him. She didn\u2019t care what time\nit was.\nThe polished black door was shut, but the lights were on. He was\nhome. He had to be.\n\u201cNot without an appointment,\u201d said the same guard.\nBryce took a step toward them and rebounded\u2014hard. A wall of heat\nsurrounded the compound, no doubt generated by the Fae males before her.\nOne of the guards snickered. Her face grew hot, her eyes stinging.\n\u201cGo tell your king that Bryce Quinlan needs a word. Now.\u201d\n\u201cCome back when you have an appointment, half-breed,\u201d one of the\nsentries said.\nBryce smacked her hand against their shield. It didn\u2019t so much as\nripple. \u201cTell him\u2014\u201d\nThe guards stiffened as power, dark and mighty, pulsed from behind\nher. Lightning skittered over the cobblestones. The guards\u2019 hands drifted to\ntheir swords.\nHunt said, voice like thunder, \u201cThe lady wants an audience with His\nMajesty.\u201d\n\u201cHis Majesty is unavailable.\u201d The guard who spoke had clearly noted\nthe halo at Hunt\u2019s brow. The sneer that spread across his face was one of the\nmost hideous things Bryce had ever seen. \u201cEspecially for Fallen scum and\nhalf-human skanks.\u201d\nHunt took a step toward them. \u201cSay that again.\u201d\nThe guard\u2019s sneer remained. \u201cOnce wasn\u2019t enough?\u201d\nHunt\u2019s hand fisted at his side. He\u2019d do it, she realized. He\u2019d pummel\nthese assholes into dust for her, fight his way inside the gates so she could\nhave a chat with the king.\nDown the block, Ruhn appeared, wreathed in shadow, his black hair\nplastered to his head. Flynn and Declan followed close behind him. \u201cStand\ndown,\u201d Ruhn ordered the guards. \u201cStand the fuck down.\u201d\nThey did no such thing. \u201cEven you, Prince, are not authorized to order\nthat.\u201d\nRuhn\u2019s shadows swirled at his shoulders like a phantom pair of wings,\nbut he said to Bryce, \u201cThere are other battles worth fighting with him. This\nisn\u2019t one of them.\u201d\nBryce stalked a few feet from the gate, even though the guards could\nlikely hear every word. \u201cHe deliberately chose not to help with what\nhappened to Danika.\u201d\nHunt said, \u201cSome might consider that to be interference with an\nimperial investigation.\u201d\n\u201cFuck off, Athalar,\u201d Ruhn growled. He reached for Bryce\u2019s arm, but\nshe stepped back. He clenched his jaw. \u201cYou are considered a member of\nthis court, you know. You were involved in a colossal mess. He decided the\nbest thing for your safety was to let the case drop, not dig further.\u201d\n\u201cAs if he\u2019s ever given two shits about my safety.\u201d\n\u201cHe gave enough of a shit about you to want me to be your live-in\nguard. But you wanted Athalar to play sexy roomie.\u201d\n\u201cHe wants to find the Horn for himself,\u201d she snapped. \u201cIt has nothing\nto do with me.\u201d She pointed to the house beyond the iron fence. \u201cYou go in\nthere and tell that piece of shit that I won\u2019t forget this. Ever. I doubt he\u2019ll\ncare, but you tell him.\u201d\nRuhn\u2019s shadows stilled, draping from his shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Bryce.\nAbout Danika\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDo not,\u201d she seethed, \u201cever say her name to me. Never say her name\nto me again.\u201d\nShe could have sworn hurt that even his shadows couldn\u2019t hide flashed\nacross her brother\u2019s face, but she turned, finding Hunt watching with\ncrossed arms. \u201cI\u2019ll see you at the apartment,\u201d she said to him, and didn\u2019t\nbother to say more before launching back into a run.\nIt had been fucked up to not warn Hunt whom she was summoning. She\u2019d\nadmit it.\nBut not as fucked up as the Fae tests her father had declined to provide\naccess to.\nBryce didn\u2019t go home. Halfway there, she decided she\u2019d head\nsomewhere else. The White Raven was shut down, but her old favorite\nwhiskey bar would do just fine.\nLethe was open and serving. Which was good, because her leg\nthrobbed mercilessly and her feet were blistered from running in her stupid\nflats. She took them off the moment she hopped onto the leather stool at the\nbar, and sighed as her bare feet touched the cool brass footrest running the\nlength of the dark wood counter.\nLethe hadn\u2019t changed in the two years since she\u2019d last set foot on the\nfloor that lent itself to an optical illusion, painted with black, gray, and\nwhite cubes. The cherrywood pillars still rose like trees to form the carved,\narched ceiling high above, looming over a bar made from fogged glass and\nblack metal, all clean lines and square edges.\nShe\u2019d messaged Juniper five minutes ago, inviting her for a drink. She\nstill hadn\u2019t heard back. So she\u2019d watched the news on the screen above the\nbar, flashing to the muddy battlefields in Pangera, the husks of mech-suits\nlittering them like broken toys, bodies both human and Vanir sprawled for\nmiles, the crows already feasting.\nEven the human busboy had stopped to look, his face tight as he\nbeheld the carnage. A barked order from the bartender had kept him\nmoving, but Bryce had seen the gleam in the young man\u2019s brown eyes. The\nfury and determination.\n\u201cWhat the Hel,\u201d she muttered, and knocked back a mouthful of the\nwhiskey in front of her.\nIt tasted as acrid and vile as she remembered\u2014burned all the way\ndown. Precisely what she wanted. Bryce took another swig.\nA bottle of some sort of purple tonic plunked onto the counter beside\nher tumbler. \u201cFor your leg,\u201d Hunt said, sliding onto the stool beside hers.\n\u201cDrink up.\u201d\nShe eyed the glass vial. \u201cYou went to a medwitch?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s a clinic around the corner. I figured you weren\u2019t leaving here\nanytime soon.\u201d\nBryce sipped her whiskey. \u201cYou guessed right.\u201d\nHe nudged the tonic closer. \u201cHave it before you finish the rest.\u201d\n\u201cNo comment about breaking my No Drinking rule?\u201d\nHe leaned on the bar, tucking in his wings. \u201cIt\u2019s your rule\u2014you can\nend it whenever you like.\u201d\nWhatever. She reached for the tonic, uncorking and knocking it back.\nShe grimaced. \u201cTastes like grape soda.\u201d\n\u201cI told her to make it sweet.\u201d\nShe batted her eyelashes. \u201cBecause I\u2019m so sweet, Athalar?\u201d\n\u201cBecause I knew you wouldn\u2019t drink it if it tasted like rubbing\nalcohol.\u201d\nShe lifted her whiskey. \u201cI beg to differ.\u201d\nHunt signaled the bartender, ordered a water, and said to Bryce, \u201cSo,\ntonight went well.\u201d\nShe chuckled, sipping the whiskey again. Gods, it tasted awful. Why\nhad she ever guzzled this stuff down? \u201cSuperb.\u201d\nHunt drank from his water. Watched her for a long moment before he\nsaid, \u201cLook, I\u2019ll sit here while you get stupid drunk if that\u2019s what you want,\nbut I\u2019ll just say this first: there are better ways to deal with everything.\u201d\n\u201cThanks, Mom.\u201d\n\u201cI mean it.\u201d\nThe bartender set another whiskey before her, but Bryce didn\u2019t drink.\nHunt said carefully, \u201cYou\u2019re not the only person to have lost someone\nyou love.\u201d\nShe propped her head on a hand. \u201cTell me all about her, Hunt. Let\u2019s\nhear the full, unabridged sob story at last.\u201d\nHe held her gaze. \u201cDon\u2019t be an asshole. I\u2019m trying to talk to you.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m trying to drink,\u201d she said, lifting her glass to do so.\nHer phone buzzed, and both of them glanced at it. Juniper had finally\nwritten back.\nCan\u2019t, sorry. Practice. Then another buzz from Juniper. Wait\u2014why are\nyou drinking at Lethe? Are you drinking again? What happened?\nHunt said quietly, \u201cMaybe your friend is trying to tell you something,\ntoo.\u201d\nBryce\u2019s fingers curled into fists, but she set her phone facedown on the\nglowing, fogged glass. \u201cWeren\u2019t you going to tell me your heartbreaking\nstory about your amazing girlfriend? What would she think about the way\nyou manhandled me and practically devoured my neck the other night?\u201d\nShe regretted the words the moment they were out. For so many\nreasons, she regretted them, the least of which being that she hadn\u2019t been\nable to stop thinking about that moment of insanity on the roof, when his\nmouth had been on her neck and she\u2019d started to completely unravel.\nHow good it had felt\u2014he had felt.\nHunt stared her down for a long moment. Heat rose to her face.\nBut all he said was \u201cI\u2019ll see you at home.\u201d The word echoed between\nthem as he set another purple tonic on the counter. \u201cDrink that one in thirty\nminutes.\u201d\nThen he was gone, prowling through the empty bar and onto the street\nbeyond.\nHunt had just settled onto the couch to watch the sunball game when Bryce\nwalked into the apartment, two bags of groceries in her hands. About\nfucking time.\nSyrinx flung himself off the couch and bounded to her, rising onto his\nback legs to demand kisses. She obliged him, ruffling his golden fur before\nlooking up at where Hunt sat on the couch. He just sipped from his beer and\ngave her a terse nod.\nShe nodded back, not quite meeting his eyes, and strode for the\nkitchen. The limp was better, but not wholly gone.\nHe\u2019d sent Naomi to monitor the street outside that fancy whiskey bar\nwhile he hit the gym to work off his temper.\nManhandled. The word had lingered. Along with the truth: he hadn\u2019t\nthought about Shahar for a second while they\u2019d been on the roof. Or in the\ndays following. And when he\u2019d had his hand wrapped around his cock in\nthe shower that night, and every night since, it hadn\u2019t been the Archangel\nhe\u2019d thought of. Not even close.\nQuinlan had to know that. She had to know what wound she\u2019d hit.\nSo the options had been to yell at her, or to exercise. He\u2019d picked the\nlatter.\nThat had been two hours ago. He\u2019d cleaned up all the obsidian salt,\nwalked and fed Syrinx, and then sat on the couch to wait.\nBryce set her bags onto the counter, Syrinx lingering at her feet to\ninspect every purchase. In between plays, Hunt stole glances at what she\nunpacked. Vegetables, fruits, meat, oat milk, cow\u2019s milk, rice, a loaf of\nbrown bread\u2014\n\u201cAre we having company?\u201d he asked.\nShe yanked out a skillet and plunked it on the burner. \u201cI figured I\u2019d\nmake a late dinner.\u201d\nHer back was stiff, her shoulders straight. He might have thought she\nwas pissed, but the fact that she was making dinner for them suggested\notherwise. \u201cIs it wise to cook when you\u2019ve been pounding whiskey?\u201d\nShe shot him a glare over a shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m trying to do something nice,\nand you\u2019re not making it easy.\u201d\nHunt held up his hands. \u201cAll right. Sorry.\u201d\nShe went back to the stove, adjusted the heat, and opened a package of\nsome sort of ground meat. \u201cI wasn\u2019t pounding whiskey,\u201d she said. \u201cI left\nLethe soon after you did.\u201d\n\u201cWhere\u2019d you go?\u201d\n\u201cOut to a storage unit near Moonwood.\u201d She began gathering spices. \u201cI\nstashed a lot of Danika\u2019s stuff there. Sabine was going to chuck it, but I\ntook it before she did.\u201d She dumped some ground meat in the skillet and\ngestured to a third bag she\u2019d left by the door. \u201cI just wanted to make sure\nthere was no hint of the Horn there, anything I might not have noticed at the\ntime. And to grab some of Danika\u2019s clothes\u2014ones that were in my bedroom\nthat night that Evidence didn\u2019t take. I know they already have clothes from\nbefore, but I thought \u2026 Maybe there\u2019s something on these, too.\u201d\nHunt opened his mouth to say something\u2014what, exactly, he didn\u2019t\nknow\u2014but Bryce went on. \u201cAfter that, I went to the market. Since\ncondiments aren\u2019t food, apparently.\u201d\nHunt brought his beer with him as he padded to the kitchen. \u201cWant\nhelp?\u201d\n\u201cNo. This is an apology meal. Go watch your game.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to apologize.\u201d\n\u201cI acted like an asshole. Let me cook something for you to make up for\nit.\u201d\n\u201cBased on how much chili powder you just dumped into that pan, I\u2019m\nnot sure I want to accept this particular apology.\u201d\n\u201cFuck, I forgot to add the cumin!\u201d She whirled toward the skillet,\nturning down the heat and adding the spice, stirring it into what smelled like\nground turkey. She sighed. \u201cI\u2019m a mess.\u201d\nHe waited, letting her gather her words.\nShe began cutting an onion, her motions easy and smooth.\n\u201cHonestly, I was a bit of a mess before what happened to Danika, and\n\u2026\u201d She sliced the onion into neat rings. \u201cIt didn\u2019t get any better.\u201d\n\u201cWhy were you a mess before she died?\u201d\nBryce slid the onion into the skillet. \u201cI\u2019m a half-human with a near-\nuseless college degree. All my friends were going somewhere, doing\nsomething with themselves.\u201d Her mouth quirked to the side. \u201cI\u2019m a\nglorified secretary. With no long-term plan for anything.\u201d She stirred the\nonion around. \u201cThe partying and stuff\u2014it was the only time when the four\nof us were on equal footing. When it didn\u2019t matter that Fury\u2019s some kind of\nmerc or Juniper\u2019s so amazingly talented or Danika would one day be this\nall-powerful wolf.\u201d\n\u201cThey ever hold that against you?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Her amber eyes scanned his face. \u201cNo, they would never have\ndone that. But I couldn\u2019t ever forget it.\u201d\n\u201cYour cousin said you used to dance. That you stopped after Danika\ndied. You never wanted to follow that road?\u201d\nShe pointed to the sweep of her hips. \u201cI was told my half-human body\nwas too clunky. I was also told that my boobs were too big, and my ass\ncould be used as an aerialport landing pad.\u201d\n\u201cYour ass is perfect.\u201d The words slipped out. He refrained from\ncommenting on just how much he liked the other parts of her, too. How\nmuch he wanted to worship them. Starting with that ass of hers.\nColor bloomed on her cheeks. \u201cWell, thank you.\u201d She stirred the\ncontents of the skillet.\n\u201cBut you don\u2019t dance for fun anymore?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Her eyes went cold at that. \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you never thought of doing anything else?\u201d\n\u201cOf course I have. I\u2019ve got ten job applications hidden on my work\ncomputer, but I can\u2019t focus enough to finish them. It\u2019s been so long since I\nsaw the job postings that they\u2019re probably filled by now anyway. It doesn\u2019t\neven matter that I\u2019d also have to find some way to convince Jesiba that I\u2019ll\nkeep paying off my debt to her.\u201d She kept stirring. \u201cA human life span\nseems like a long time to fill, but an immortal one?\u201d She hooked her hair\nbehind an ear. \u201cI have no idea what to do.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m two hundred thirty-three years old, and I\u2019m still figuring it out.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but you\u2014you did something. You fought for something. You\nare someone.\u201d\nHe tapped the slave tattoo on his wrist. \u201cAnd look where I wound up.\u201d\nShe turned from the stove. \u201cHunt, I really am sorry for what I said\nabout Shahar.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d\nBryce jerked her chin toward Hunt\u2019s open bedroom door, the photo of\nher and Danika just barely visible on the dresser. \u201cMy mom took that the\nday we got out of the hospital in Rosque.\u201d\nHe knew she was building to something, and was willing to play\nalong. \u201cWhy were you in the hospital?\u201d\n\u201cDanika\u2019s senior thesis was on the history of the illegal animal trade.\nShe uncovered a real smuggling ring, but no one in the Aux or the 33rd\nwould help her, so she and I went to deal with it ourselves.\u201d Bryce snorted.\n\u201cThe operation was run by five asp shifters, who caught us trying to free\ntheir stock. We called them asp-holes, and things went downhill from\nthere.\u201d\nOf course they did. \u201cHow downhill?\u201d\n\u201cA motorcycle chase and crash, my right arm broken in three places,\nDanika\u2019s pelvis fractured. Danika got shot twice in the leg.\u201d\n\u201cGods.\u201d\n\u201cYou should have seen the asp-holes.\u201d\n\u201cYou killed them?\u201d\nHer eyes darkened, nothing but pure Fae predator shining there.\n\u201cSome. The ones who shot Danika \u2026 I took care of them. The police got\nthe rest.\u201d Burning Solas. He had a feeling there was far more to the story. \u201cI\nknow people think Danika was a reckless partier with mommy issues, I\nknow Sabine thinks that, but \u2026 Danika went to free those animals because\nshe literally couldn\u2019t sleep at night knowing they were in cages, terrified\nand alone.\u201d\nThe Party Princess, Hunt and the triarii had mocked her behind her\nback.\nBryce went on, \u201cDanika was always doing that kind of thing\u2014helping\npeople Sabine thought were beneath them. Some part of her might have\ndone it to piss off her mom, yeah, but most of it was because she wanted to\nhelp. That\u2019s why she went easy on Philip Briggs and his group, why she\ngave him so many chances.\u201d She let out a long breath. \u201cShe was difficult,\nbut she was good.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what about you?\u201d he asked carefully.\nShe ran a hand through her hair. \u201cMost days, I feel cold as it was in\nhere with Aidas. Most days, all I want is to go back. To how it was before. I\ncan\u2019t bear to keep going forward.\u201d\nHunt gazed at her for a long moment. \u201cThere were some of the Fallen\nwho accepted the halo and slave tattoo, you know. After a few decades, they\naccepted it. Stopped fighting it.\u201d\n\u201cWhy have you never stopped?\u201d\n\u201cBecause we were right then, and we\u2019re still right now. Shahar was\nonly the spear point. I followed her blindly into a battle we could never\nhave won, but I believed in what she stood for.\u201d\n\u201cIf you could do it over, march under Shahar\u2019s banner again\u2014would\nyou?\u201d\nHunt considered that. He didn\u2019t normally let himself dwell too long on\nwhat had happened, what had occurred since then. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t rebelled with\nher, I\u2019d probably have been noticed by another Archangel for my lightning.\nI\u2019d likely now be serving as a commander in one of Pangera\u2019s cities, hoping\nto one day earn enough to buy my way out of service. But they\u2019d never let\nsomeone with my gifts go. And I had little choice but to join a legion. It was\nthe path I was pushed onto, and the lightning, the killing\u2014I never asked to\nbe good at it. I\u2019d give it up in a heartbeat if I could.\u201d\nHer eyes flickered with understanding. \u201cI know.\u201d He lifted a brow. She\nclarified, \u201cThe being good at something you don\u2019t want to be good at. That\ntalent you\u2019d let go of in a heartbeat.\u201d He angled his head. \u201cI mean, look at\nme: I\u2019m amazing at attracting assholes.\u201d\nHunt huffed a laugh. She said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my question. Would\nyou still rebel if you knew what would happen?\u201d\nHunt sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s what I was starting to say: even if I hadn\u2019t\nrebelled, I\u2019d wind up in a sugarcoated version of my life now. Because I\u2019m\nstill a legionary being used for my so-called gifts\u2014just now officially a\nslave, rather than being forced into service by a lack of other options. The\nonly other difference is that I\u2019m serving in Valbara, in a fool\u2019s bargain with\nan Archangel, hoping to one day be forgiven for my supposed sins.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think they were sins.\u201d\n\u201cNo. I think the angel hierarchies are bullshit. We were right to rebel.\u201d\n\u201cEven though it cost you everything?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. So I guess that\u2019s my answer. I\u2019d still do it, even knowing what\nwould happen. And if I ever get free \u2026\u201d Bryce halted her stirring. Met his\nstare unblinkingly as Hunt said, \u201cI remember every one of them who was\nthere on the battlefield, who brought down Shahar. And all the angels, the\nAsteri, the Senate, the Governors\u2014all of them, who were there at our\nsentencing.\u201d He leaned against the counter behind them and swigged from\nhis beer, letting her fill in the rest.\n\u201cAnd after you\u2019ve killed them all? What then?\u201d\nHe blinked at the lack of fear, of judgment. \u201cAssuming I live through\nit, you mean.\u201d\n\u201cAssuming you live through taking on the Archangels and Asteri, what\nthen?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He gave her a half smile. \u201cMaybe you and I can figure\nit out, Quinlan. We\u2019ll have centuries to do it.\u201d\n\u201cIf I make the Drop.\u201d\nHe started. \u201cYou would choose not to?\u201d It was rare\u2014so, so rare for a\nVanir to refuse to make the Drop and live only a mortal life span.\nShe added more vegetables and seasoning to the pan before throwing a\npacket of instant rice into the microwave. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019d need an\nAnchor.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about Ruhn?\u201d Her cousin, even if neither of them would admit\nit, would take on every beast in the Pit itself to protect her.\nShe threw him a look dripping with disdain. \u201cNo fucking way.\u201d\n\u201cJuniper, then?\u201d Someone she truly trusted, loved.\n\u201cShe\u2019d do it, but it doesn\u2019t feel right. And using one of the public\nAnchors isn\u2019t for me.\u201d\n\u201cI used one. It was fine.\u201d He spied the questions brimming in her eyes\nand cut her off before she could voice them. \u201cMaybe you\u2019ll change your\nmind.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d She chewed on her lip. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you lost your friends.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry you lost yours.\u201d\nBryce nodded her thanks, going back to stirring. \u201cI know people don\u2019t\nget it. It\u2019s just \u2026 a light went out inside me when it happened. Danika\nwasn\u2019t my sister, or my lover. But she was the one person I could be myself\naround and never feel judged. The one person that I knew would always\npick up the phone, or call me back. She was the one person who made me\nfeel brave because no matter what happened, no matter how bad or\nembarrassing or shitty it was, I knew that I had her in my corner. That if it\nall went to Hel, I could talk to her and it would be fine.\u201d\nHer eyes gleamed, and it was all he could do to not cross the few feet\nbetween them and grab her hand as she continued. \u201cBut it \u2026 It\u2019s not fine. I\nwill never talk to her again. I think people expect me to be over it by now.\nBut I can\u2019t. Anytime I get anywhere close to the truth of my new reality, I\nwant to space out again. To not have to be me. I can\u2019t fucking dance\nanymore because it reminds me of her\u2014of all the dancing we did together\nin clubs or on the streets or in our apartment or dorm. I won\u2019t let myself\ndance anymore because it brought me joy, and \u2026 And I didn\u2019t, I don\u2019t, want\nto feel those things.\u201d She swallowed. \u201cI know it sounds pathetic.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d he said quietly.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I dumped my baggage in your lap.\u201d\nA corner of his mouth turned up. \u201cYou can dump your baggage in my\nlap anytime, Quinlan.\u201d\nShe snorted, shaking her head. \u201cYou made it sound gross.\u201d\n\u201cYou said it first.\u201d Her mouth twitched. Damn, if the smile didn\u2019t make\nhis chest tighten.\nBut Hunt just said, \u201cI know you\u2019ll keep going forward, Quinlan\u2014even\nif it sucks.\u201d\n\u201cWhat makes you so sure of it?\u201d\nHis feet were silent as he crossed the kitchen. She tipped back her head\nto hold his stare. \u201cBecause you pretend to be irreverent and lazy, but deep\ndown, you don\u2019t give up. Because you know that if you do, then they win.\nAll the asp-holes, as you called them, win. So living, and living well\u2014it\u2019s\nthe greatest fuck you that you can ever give them.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re still fighting.\u201d\nHe ran a hand over the tattoo on his brow. \u201cYes.\u201d\nShe let out a hmm, stirring the mixture in the pan again. \u201cWell then,\nAthalar. I guess it\u2019ll be you and me in the trenches for a while longer.\u201d\nHe smiled at her, more openly than he\u2019d dared do with anyone in a\nlong while. \u201cYou know,\u201d he said, \u201cI think I like the sound of that.\u201d\nHer eyes warmed further, a blush stealing across her freckled cheeks.\n\u201cYou said home earlier. At the bar.\u201d\nHe had. He\u2019d tried not to think about it.\nShe went on, \u201cI know you\u2019re supposed to live in the barracks or\nwhatever Micah insists on, but if we somehow solve this case \u2026 that room\nis yours, if you want it.\u201d\nThe offer rippled through him. And he couldn\u2019t think of a single word\nbeyond \u201cThanks.\u201d It was all that was necessary, he realized.\nThe rice finished cooking, and she divvied it into two bowls before\ndumping the meat mixture on top of it. She extended one to him. \u201cNothing\ngourmet, but \u2026 here. I\u2019m sorry for earlier.\u201d\nHunt studied the steaming heap of meat and rice. He\u2019d seen dogs\nserved fancier meals. But he smiled slightly, his chest inexplicably\ntightening again. \u201cApology accepted, Quinlan.\u201d\nA cat was sitting on her dresser.\nExhaustion weighed her eyelids, so heavily she could barely raise\nthem.\nEyes like the sky before dawn pinned her to the spot.\nWhat blinds an Oracle, Bryce Quinlan?\nHer mouth formed a word, but sleep tugged her back into its embrace.\nThe cat\u2019s blue eyes simmered. What blinds an Oracle?\nShe fought to keep her eyes open at the question, the urgency.\nYou know, she tried to say.\nThe Autumn King\u2019s only daughter\u2014thrown out like rubbish.\nThe cat had either guessed it at the temple all those years ago, or\nfollowed her home to confirm whose villa she had tried to enter.\nHe\u2019ll kill me if he knows.\nThe cat licked a paw. Then make the Drop.\nShe tried to speak again. Sleep held her firm, but she finally managed,\nAnd what then?\nThe cat\u2019s whiskers twitched. I told you. Come find me.\nHer eyelids drooped\u2014a final descent toward sleep. Why?\nThe cat angled its head. So we can finish this."}, "53": {"Name": "PART III THE CANYON-Chapter 53", "Page Content": " 3 \nIt was still raining the next morning, which Bryce decided was an omen.\nToday would suck. Last night had sucked.\nSyrinx refused to emerge from under the sheets, even though Bryce\ntried to coax him with the promise of breakfast before his walk, and by the\ntime Bryce finally hauled him to the street below, Hunt monitoring from the\nwindows, the rain had gone from a pleasant patter to an outright deluge.\nA fat hoptoad squatted in the corner of the building doorway, under the\nslight overhang, waiting for any small, unfortunate Vanir to fly past. He\neyed Bryce and Syrinx as they splashed by, earning a whiskery huff from\nthe latter, and sidled closer to the side of the building.\n\u201cCreep,\u201d she murmured above the drumming rain on the hood of her\ncoat, feeling the hoptoad watch them down the block. For a creature no\nbigger than her fist, they found ways to be menaces. Namely to all manner\nof sprites. Even confined to the library, Lehabah loathed and dreaded them.\nDespite her navy raincoat, her black leggings and white T-shirt were\nsoon soaked. As if the rain somehow went up from the ground. It pooled in\nher green rain boots, too, squelching with every step she made through the\nlashing rain, the palms swaying and hissing overhead.\nThe rainiest spring on record, the news had proclaimed last night. She\ndidn\u2019t doubt it.\nThe hoptoad was still there when they returned, Syrinx having\ncompleted his morning routine in record time, and Bryce might or might not\nhave gone out of her way to stomp in a nearby puddle.\nThe hoptoad had stuck out his tongue at her, but flopped away.\nHunt was standing at the stove, cooking something that smelled like\nbacon. He glanced over his shoulder while she removed her raincoat,\ndripping all over the floor. \u201cYou hungry?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d\nHis eyes narrowed. \u201cYou should eat something before we go.\u201d\nShe waved him off, scooping food into Syrinx\u2019s bowl.\nWhen she stood, she found Hunt extending a plate toward her. Bacon\nand eggs and thick brown toast. \u201cI watched you pick at your food for five\ndays this past week,\u201d he said roughly. \u201cWe\u2019re not starting down that road\nagain.\u201d\nShe rolled her eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t need a male telling me when to eat.\u201d\n\u201cHow about a friend telling you that you had an understandably rough\nnight, and you get mean as shit when you\u2019re hungry?\u201d\nBryce scowled. Hunt just kept holding out the plate.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right to be nervous, you know,\u201d he said. He nodded toward the\npaper bag she\u2019d left by the door\u2014Danika\u2019s clothes, folded and ready for\nanalysis. She\u2019d overheard Hunt calling Viktoria thirty minutes ago, asking\nher to get the Mimir tech from the Fae. She\u2019d said Declan already sent it.\nBryce said, \u201cI\u2019m not nervous. They\u2019re just clothes.\u201d He only stared at\nher. Bryce growled. \u201cI\u2019m not. Let them lose the clothes in Evidence or\nwhatever.\u201d\n\u201cThen eat.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t like eggs.\u201d\nHis mouth twitched upward. \u201cI\u2019ve seen you eat about three dozen of\nthem.\u201d\nTheir gazes met and held. \u201cWho taught you to cook, anyway?\u201d He sure\nas Hel was a better cook than she was. The pitiful dinner she\u2019d made him\nlast night was proof.\n\u201cI taught myself. It\u2019s a useful skill for a soldier. Makes you a popular\nperson in any legion camp. Besides, I\u2019ve got two centuries under my belt.\nIt\u2019d be pathetic not to know how to cook at this point.\u201d He held the plate\ncloser. \u201cEat up, Quinlan. I won\u2019t let anyone lose those clothes.\u201d\nShe debated throwing the plate in his face, but finally took it and\nplunked into the seat at the head of the dining table. Syrinx trotted over to\nher, already gazing expectantly at the bacon.\nA cup of coffee appeared on the table a heartbeat later, the cream still\nswirling inside.\nHunt smirked at her. \u201cWouldn\u2019t want you to head out to the world\nwithout the proper provisions.\u201d\nBryce flipped him off, took his phone from where he\u2019d left it on the\ntable, and snapped a few pictures: the breakfast, the coffee, his stupid\nsmirking face, Syrinx sitting beside her, and her own scowl. But she drank\nthe coffee anyway.\nBy the time she put her mug into the sink, Hunt finishing up his meal\nat the table behind her, she found her steps feeling lighter than they had in a\nwhile.\n\u201cDon\u2019t lose those,\u201d Hunt warned Viktoria as she sifted through the bag on\nher desk.\nThe wraith looked up from the faded gray band T-shirt with a wailing,\nrobed figure on the front. The Banshees. \u201cWe\u2019ve got clothes in Evidence for\nDanika Fendyr and the other victims.\u201d\n\u201cFine, but use these, too,\u201d Hunt said. Just in case someone had\ntampered with the evidence here\u2014and to let Quinlan feel as if she\u2019d helped\nwith this. Bryce was at the gallery dealing with some snooty customer, with\nNaomi watching. \u201cYou got the Mimir tech from Declan?\u201d\n\u201cAs I said on the phone: yes.\u201d Vik peered into the bag again. \u201cI\u2019ll give\nyou a call if anything comes up.\u201d\nHunt stretched a piece of paper across the desk. \u201cSee if traces of any of\nthese come up, too.\u201d\nViktoria took one look at the words on it and went pale, her halo stark\nover her brow. \u201cYou think it\u2019s one of these demons?\u201d\n\u201cI hope not.\u201d\nHe\u2019d made a list of potential demons that might be working in\nconjunction with the kristallos, all ancient and terrible, his dread deepening\nwith each new name he added. Many of them were nightmares that prowled\nbedtime stories. All of them were catastrophic if they entered Midgard.\nHe\u2019d faced two of them before\u2014and barely made it through the encounters.\nHunt nodded toward the bag again. \u201cI mean it: don\u2019t lose those\nclothes,\u201d he said again.\n\u201cGoing soft, Athalar?\u201d\nHunt rolled his eyes and aimed for the doorway. \u201cI just like my balls\nwhere they are.\u201d\nViktoria notified Hunt that evening that she was still running the diagnostic.\nThe Fae\u2019s Mimir tech was thorough enough that it\u2019d take a good while to\nrun.\nHe prayed the results wouldn\u2019t be as devastating as he expected.\nHe\u2019d messaged Bryce about it while she finished up work, chuckling\nwhen he saw that she\u2019d again changed her contact information in his phone:\nBryce Is a Queen.\nThey stayed up until midnight binge-watching a reality show about a\nbunch of hot young Vanir working at a beach club in the Coronal Islands.\nHe\u2019d refused at first\u2014but by the end of the first hour, he\u2019d been the one\npressing play on the next episode. Then the next.\nIt hadn\u2019t hurt that they\u2019d gone from sitting on opposite ends of the\nsectional to being side by side, his thigh pressed against hers. He might\nhave toyed with her braid. She might have let him.\nThe next morning, Hunt was just following Bryce toward the\napartment elevator when his phone rang. He took one look at the number\nand grimaced before picking up. \u201cHi, Micah.\u201d\n\u201cMy office. Fifteen minutes.\u201d\nBryce pressed the elevator button, but Hunt pointed to the roof door.\nHe\u2019d fly her to the gallery, then head to the CBD. \u201cAll right,\u201d he said\ncarefully. \u201cDo you want Miss Quinlan to join us?\u201d\n\u201cJust you.\u201d The line went dead."}, "54": {"Name": "PART III THE CANYON-Chapter 54", "Page Content": " 4 \nHunt took a back entrance into the tower, careful to avoid any area that\nSandriel might be frequenting. Isaiah hadn\u2019t picked up, and he knew better\nthan to keep calling until he did.\nMicah was staring out the window when he arrived, his power already\na brewing storm in the room. \u201cWhy,\u201d the Archangel asked, \u201care you running\nFae tests on old evidence down at the lab?\u201d\n\u201cWe have good reason to think the demon we identified isn\u2019t the one\nbehind Danika Fendyr\u2019s death. If we can find what actually did kill her, it\nmight lead us to whoever summoned it.\u201d\n\u201cThe Summit is in two weeks.\u201d\n\u201cI know. We\u2019re working as hard as we can.\u201d\n\u201cAre you? Drinking at a whiskey bar with Bryce Quinlan counts as\nworking?\u201d\nAsshole. \u201cWe\u2019re on it. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d\n\u201cSabine Fendyr called my office, you know. To rip my head off about\nbeing a suspect.\u201d There was nothing humane behind those eyes. Only cold\npredator.\n\u201cIt was a mistake, and we\u2019ll own up to that, but we had sufficient cause\nto believe\u2014\u201d\n\u201cGet. The. Job. Done.\u201d\nHunt gritted out, \u201cWe will.\u201d\nMicah surveyed him coolly. Then he said, \u201cSandriel has been asking\nabout you\u2014about Miss Quinlan, too. She\u2019s made me a few generous offers\nto trade again.\u201d Hunt\u2019s stomach became leaden. \u201cI\u2019ve turned her down so\nfar. I told her that you\u2019re too valuable to me.\u201d\nMicah threw a file on the table, then turned back to the window.\n\u201cDon\u2019t make me reconsider, Hunt.\u201d\nHunt read through the file\u2014the silent order it conveyed. His punishment.\nFor Sabine, for taking too long, for just existing. A death for a death.\nHe stopped at the barracks to pick up his helmet.\nMicah had written a note in the margin of the list of targets, their\ncrimes. No guns.\nSo Hunt grabbed a few more of his black-hilted daggers, and his long-\nhandled knife, too.\nEvery movement was careful. Deliberate. Every shift of his body as he\ndonned his black battle-suit quieted his mind, pulling him farther and\nfarther from himself.\nHis phone buzzed on his desk, and he glanced at it only long enough to\nsee that Bryce Is a Queen had written to him: Everything okay?\nHunt slid on his black gloves.\nHis phone buzzed again.\nI\u2019m going to order in dumpling soup for lunch. Want some?\nHunt turned the phone over, blocking the screen from view. As if it\u2019d\nsomehow stop her from learning what he was doing. He gathered his\nweapons with centuries of efficiency. And then donned the helmet.\nThe world descended into cool calculations, its colors dimmed.\nOnly then did he pick up his phone and write back to Bryce, I\u2019m good.\nI\u2019ll see you later.\nShe\u2019d written back by the time he reached the barracks landing pad.\nHe\u2019d watched the typing bubble pop up, vanish, then pop up again. Like\nshe\u2019d written out ten different replies before settling on Okay.\nHunt shut off his phone as he shouldered his way through the doors\nand into the open air.\nHe was a stain against the brightness. A shadow standing against the\nsun.\nA flap of his wings had him skyborne. And he did not look back.\nSomething was wrong.\nBryce had known it the moment she realized she hadn\u2019t heard from\nhim after an hour in the Comitium.\nThe feeling had only worsened at his vague response to her message.\nNo mention of why he\u2019d been called in, what he was up to.\nAs if someone else had written it for him.\nShe\u2019d typed out a dozen different replies to that not-Hunt message.\nPlease tell me everything is okay.\nType 1 if you need help.\nDid I do something to upset you?\nWhat\u2019s wrong?\nDo you need me to come to the Comitium?\nTurning down an offer of dumpling soup\u2014did someone steal this\nphone?\nOn and on, writing and deleting, until she\u2019d written, I\u2019m worried.\nPlease call me. But she had no right to be worried, to demand those things\nof him.\nSo she\u2019d settled with a pathetic Okay.\nAnd had not heard back from him. She\u2019d checked her phone\nobsessively the whole workday.\nNothing.\nWorry was a writhing knot in her stomach. She didn\u2019t even order the\nsoup. A glance at the roof cameras showed Naomi sitting there all day, her\nface tight.\nBryce had gone up there around three. \u201cDo you have any idea where\nhe might have gone?\u201d she asked, her arms wrapped tightly around herself.\nNaomi looked her over. \u201cHunt is fine,\u201d she said. \u201cHe \u2026\u201d She stopped\nherself, reading something on Bryce\u2019s face. Surprise flickered in her eyes.\n\u201cHe\u2019s fine,\u201d the angel said gently.\nBy the time Bryce got home, with Naomi stationed on the adjacent\nrooftop, she had stopped believing her.\nSo she\u2019d decided to Hel with it. To Hel with caution or looking cool or\nany of it.\nStanding in her kitchen as the clock crept toward eight, she wrote to\nHunt, Please call me. I\u2019m worried about you.\nThere. Let it shoot into the ether or wherever the messages floated.\nShe walked Syrinx one final time for the night, her phone clutched in\nher hand. As if the harder she gripped it, the more likely he\u2019d be to respond.\nIt was eleven by the time she broke, and dialed a familiar number.\nRuhn picked up on the first ring. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nHow he knew, she didn\u2019t care. \u201cI \u2026\u201d She swallowed.\n\u201cBryce.\u201d Ruhn\u2019s voice sharpened. Music was playing in the\nbackground, but it began to shift, as if he were moving to a quieter part of\nwherever he was.\n\u201cHave you seen Hunt anywhere today?\u201d Her voice sounded thin and\nhigh.\nIn the background, Flynn asked, \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d\nRuhn just asked her, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n\u201cLike, have you seen Hunt at the gun range, or anywhere\u2014\u201d\nThe music faded. A door slammed. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d\n\u201cHome.\u201d It hit her then, the rush of how stupid this was, calling him,\nasking if Ruhn, of all people, knew what the Governor\u2019s personal assassin\nwas doing.\n\u201cGive me five minutes\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t need you here. I\u2019m fine. I just \u2026\u201d Her throat burned. \u201cI\ncan\u2019t find him.\u201d What if Hunt was lying in a pile of bones and flesh and\nblood?\nWhen her silence dragged on, Ruhn said with quiet intensity, \u201cI\u2019ll put\nDec and Flynn on it right\u2014\u201d\nThe enchantments hummed, and the front door unlocked.\nBryce went still as the door slowly opened. As Hunt, clad in battle-\nblack and wearing that famed helmet, walked in.\nEvery step seemed like it took all of his concentration. And his scent\u2014\nBlood.\nNot his own.\n\u201cBryce?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s back,\u201d she breathed into the phone. \u201cI\u2019ll call you tomorrow,\u201d she\nsaid to her brother, and hung up.\nHunt paused in the center of the room.\nBlood stained his wings. Shone on his leather suit. Splattered the visor\nof his helmet.\n\u201cWhat\u2014what happened?\u201d she managed to get out.\nHe began walking again. Walked straight past her, the scent of all that\nblood\u2014several different types of blood\u2014staining the air. He didn\u2019t say a\nword.\n\u201cHunt.\u201d Any relief that had surged through her now transformed into\nsomething sharper.\nHe headed for his room and did not stop. She didn\u2019t dare to move. He\nwas a wraith, a demon, a\u2014a shadow of death.\nThis male, helmeted and in his battle clothes \u2026 she didn\u2019t know him.\nHunt reached his room, not even looking at her as he shut the door\nbehind him.\nHe couldn\u2019t stand it.\nHe couldn\u2019t stand the look of pure, knee-wobbling relief on her face\nwhen he\u2019d walked into the apartment. He\u2019d come right back here after he\u2019d\nfinished because he thought she\u2019d be asleep and he could wash off the\nblood without having to go back to the Comitium barracks first, but she\u2019d\nbeen just standing in the living room. Waiting for him.\nAnd as he\u2019d stepped into the apartment and she\u2019d seen and smelled the\nblood \u2026\nHe couldn\u2019t stand the horror and pain on her face, either.\nYou see what this life has done to me? he wanted to ask. But he had\nbeen beyond words. There had been only screaming until now. From the\nthree males he\u2019d spent hours ending, all of it done to Micah\u2019s specifications.\nHunt strode for the bathroom and turned the shower up to scalding. He\nremoved the helmet, the bright lights stinging his eyes without the visor\u2019s\ncooling tones. Then he removed his gloves.\nShe had looked so horrified. It was no surprise. She couldn\u2019t have\nreally understood what he was, who he was, until now. Why people shied\naway from him. Didn\u2019t meet his eyes.\nHunt peeled his suit off, his bruised skin already healing. The drug\nlords he\u2019d ended tonight had gotten in a few blows before he\u2019d subdued\nthem. Before he\u2019d pinned them to the ground, impaled on his blades.\nAnd left them there, shrieking in pain, for hours.\nNaked, he stepped into the shower, the white tiles already sweating\nwith steam.\nThe scalding water blasted his skin like acid.\nHe swallowed his scream, his sob, his whimper, and didn\u2019t balk from\nthe boiling torrent.\nDidn\u2019t do anything as he let it burn everything away.\nMicah had sent him on a mission. Had ordered Hunt to kill someone.\nSeveral people, from the different scents on him. Did each one of those\nlives count toward his hideous debt?\nIt was his job, his path to freedom, what he did for the Governor, and\nyet \u2026 And yet Bryce had never really considered it. What it did to him.\nWhat the consequences were.\nIt wasn\u2019t a path to freedom. It was a path to Hel.\nBryce lingered in the living room, waiting for him to finish showering.\nThe water kept running. Twenty minutes. Thirty. Forty.\nWhen the clock crept up on an hour, she found herself knocking on his\ndoor. \u201cHunt?\u201d\nNo answer. The water continued.\nShe cracked the door, peering into the dim bedroom. The bathroom\ndoor stood open, steam wafting out. So much steam that the bedroom had\nturned muggy.\n\u201cHunt?\u201d She pushed forward, craning her neck to see into the bright\nbathroom. No sign of him in the shower\u2014\nA hint of a soaked gray wing rose from behind the shower glass.\nShe moved, not thinking. Not caring.\nShe was in the bathroom in a heartbeat, his name on her lips, bracing\nfor the worst, wishing she\u2019d grabbed her phone from the kitchen counter\u2014\nBut there he was. Sitting naked on the floor of the shower, his head\nbowed between his knees. Water pounded into his back, his wings, dripping\noff his hair. His gold-dusted brown skin gleamed an angry red.\nBryce took one step into the shower and hissed. The water was\nscalding. Burning hot.\n\u201cHunt,\u201d she said. He didn\u2019t so much as blink.\nShe glanced between him and the showerhead. His body was healing\nthe burns\u2014healing and then scalding, healing and scalding. It had to be\ntorturous.\nShe bit down on her yelp as she reached into the shower, the near-\nboiling water soaking her shirt, her pants, and lowered the temperature.\nHe didn\u2019t move. Didn\u2019t even look at her. He\u2019d done this many times,\nshe realized. Every time Micah had sent him out, and for all the Archangels\nhe\u2019d served before that.\nSyrinx came to investigate, sniffed at the bloody clothes, then sprawled\nhimself on the bath mat, head on his front paws.\nHunt made no indication that he knew she stood there.\nBut his breathing deepened. Became easier.\nAnd she couldn\u2019t explain why she did it, but she grabbed a bottle of\nshampoo and the block of lavender soap from the nook in the tiles. Then\nknelt before him.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to clean you off,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cIf that\u2019s all right.\u201d\nA slight but terribly clear nod was his only response. Like words were\nstill too hard.\nSo Bryce poured the shampoo into her hands, and then laced her\nfingers into his hair. The thick strands were heavy, and she gently scrubbed,\ntipping his head back to rinse it. His eyes lifted at last. Met hers, as his head\nleaned back into the stream of water.\n\u201cYou look how I feel,\u201d she whispered, her throat tight. \u201cEvery day.\u201d\nHe blinked, his only sign that he\u2019d heard.\nShe removed her hands from his hair, and picked up the bar of soap.\nHe was naked, she realized, having somehow forgotten. Utterly naked. She\ndidn\u2019t let herself contemplate it as she began lathering his neck, his\npowerful shoulders, his muscled arms. \u201cI\u2019ll leave your bottom half for you\nto enjoy,\u201d she said, her face heating.\nHe was just watching her with that raw openness. More intimate than\nany touch of his lips on her neck. Like he indeed saw everything she was\nand had been and might yet become.\nShe scrubbed down his upper body as best she could. \u201cI can\u2019t clean\nyour wings with you sitting against the wall.\u201d\nHunt rose to his feet in a mighty, graceful push.\nShe kept her eyes averted from what, exactly, this brought into her\ndirect line of vision. The very considerable something that he didn\u2019t seem to\nnotice or care about.\nSo she wouldn\u2019t care about it, either. She stood, water splattering her,\nand gently turned him. She didn\u2019t let herself admire the view from behind,\neither. The muscles and perfection of him.\nYour ass is perfect, he\u2019d said to her.\nLikewise, she could now attest.\nShe soaped his wings, now dark gray in the water.\nHe towered over her, enough that she had to rise to her toes to reach\nthe apex of his wings. In silence, she washed him, and Hunt braced his\nhands against the tiles, his head hanging. He needed rest, and the comfort of\noblivion. So Bryce rinsed off the soap, making sure each and every feather\nwas clean, and then reached around the angel to turn off the shower.\nOnly the dribbling of water eddying into the drain filled the steamy\nbathroom.\nBryce grabbed a towel, keeping her eyes up as Hunt turned to face her.\nShe slung it around his hips, yanked a second towel off the bar just outside\nthe shower stall, and ran it over his tan skin. Gently patted his wings dry.\nThen rubbed his hair.\n\u201cCome on,\u201d she murmured. \u201cBed.\u201d\nHis face became more alert, but he didn\u2019t object when she tugged him\nfrom the shower, dripping water from her sodden clothes and hair. Didn\u2019t\nobject when she led him into the bedroom, to the chest of drawers where\nhe\u2019d put his things.\nShe pulled out a pair of black undershorts and stooped down, eyes\nfirmly on the ground as she stretched out the waistband. \u201cStep in.\u201d\nHunt obeyed, first one foot and then the other. She rose, sliding the\nshorts up his powerful thighs and releasing the elastic waist with a soft\nsnap. Bryce snatched a white T-shirt from another drawer, frowned at the\ncomplicated slats on the back to fit his wings, and set it down again.\n\u201cUnderwear it is,\u201d she declared, pulling back the blanket on the bed he so\ndutifully made each morning. She patted the mattress. \u201cGet some sleep,\nHunt.\u201d\nAgain, he obeyed, sliding between the sheets with a soft groan.\nShe shut off the bathroom light, darkening the bedroom, and returned\nto where he now lay, still staring at her. Daring to stroke his damp hair away\nfrom his brow, Bryce\u2019s fingers grazed over the hateful tattoo. His eyes\nclosed.\n\u201cI was so worried about you,\u201d she whispered, stroking his hair again.\n\u201cI \u2026\u201d She couldn\u2019t finish the sentence. So she made to step back, to head to\nher room and change into dry clothes and maybe get some sleep herself.\nBut a warm, strong hand gripped her wrist. Halted her.\nShe looked back, and found Hunt staring at her again. \u201cWhat?\u201d\nA slight tug on her wrist told her everything.\nStay.\nHer chest squeezed to the point of pain. \u201cOkay.\u201d She took a breath.\n\u201cOkay, sure.\u201d\nAnd for some reason, the thought of going all the way to her bedroom,\nof leaving him for even a moment, seemed too risky. Like he might vanish\nagain if she left to change.\nSo she grabbed the white T-shirt she\u2019d intended to give him, and\ntwisted away, peeling off her own shirt and bra and chucking them into the\nbathroom. They landed with a slap on the tiles, drowning out the rustle of\nhis soft shirt as she slid it over herself. It hung down to her knees, providing\nenough coverage that she shucked off her wet sweats and underwear and\nthrew them into the bathroom, too.\nSyrinx had leapt into the bed, curling at the foot. And Hunt had moved\nover, giving her ample room. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said again, more to herself.\nThe sheets were warm, and smelled of him\u2014rain-kissed cedar. She\ntried not to breathe it in too obviously as she took up a sitting position\nagainst the headboard. And she tried not to look too shocked when he laid\nhis head on her thigh, his arm coming across her to rest on the pillow.\nA child laying his head on his mother\u2019s lap. A friend looking for any\nsort of reassuring contact to remind him that he was a living being. A good\nperson, no matter what they made him do.\nBryce tentatively brushed the hair from his brow again.\nHunt\u2019s eyes closed, but he leaned slightly into the touch. A silent\nrequest.\nSo Bryce continued stroking his hair, over and over, until his breathing\ndeepened and steadied, until his powerful body grew limp beside hers.\nIt smelled like paradise. Like home and eternity and like exactly where he\nwas meant to be.\nHunt opened his eyes to feminine softness and warmth and gentle\nbreathing.\nIn the dim light, he found himself half-sprawled across Bryce\u2019s lap, the\nwoman herself passed out against the headboard, head lolling to the side.\nHer hand still lingered in his hair, the other in the sheets by his arm.\nThe clock read three thirty. It wasn\u2019t the time that surprised him, but\nthe fact that he was clearheaded enough to notice.\nShe\u2019d taken care of him. Washed and clothed and soothed him. He\ncouldn\u2019t remember the last time anyone had done that.\nHunt carefully peeled his face from her lap, realizing that her legs were\nbare. That she wasn\u2019t wearing anything beneath his T-shirt. And his face\nhad been mere inches away.\nHis muscles protested only slightly as he rose upward. Bryce didn\u2019t so\nmuch as stir.\nShe\u2019d put him in his underwear, for fuck\u2019s sake.\nHis cheeks warmed, but he eased from the bed, Syrinx opening an eye\nto see what the commotion was about. He waved the beastie off and padded\nto Bryce\u2019s side of the mattress.\nShe stirred only slightly as he scooped her into his arms and carried\nher to her own room. He laid her on her bed, and she grumbled, protesting\nat the cool sheets, but he swiftly tossed the down comforter over her and\nleft before she could awaken.\nHe was halfway across the living area when her phone, discarded on\nthe kitchen counter, glared with light. Hunt looked at it, unable to help\nhimself.\nA chain of messages from Ruhn filled the screen, all from the past few\nhours.\nIs Athalar all right? Later, Are you all right?\nThen, an hour ago, I called the front desk of your building, and the\ndoorman reassured me that you\u2019re both up there, so I\u2019m assuming you two\nare fine. But call me in the morning.\nAnd then from thirty seconds ago, as if it were an afterthought, I\u2019m\nglad you called me tonight. I know things are fucked up between us, and I\nknow a lot of that is my fault, but if you ever need me, I\u2019m here. Anytime at\nall, Bryce.\nHunt glanced toward her bedroom hallway. She\u2019d called Ruhn\u2014that\u2019s\nwho she\u2019d been on the phone with when he got back. He rubbed at his\nchest.\nHe fell back asleep in his own bed, where the scent of her still\nlingered, like a phantom, warming touch."}, "55": {"Name": "PART III THE CANYON-Chapter 55", "Page Content": " 5 \nThe golden rays of dawn coaxed Bryce awake. The blankets were warm,\nand the bed soft, and Syrinx was still snoring\u2014\nHer room. Her bed.\nShe sat up, jostling Syrinx awake. He yowled in annoyance and\nslithered deeper under the covers, kicking her in the ribs with his hind legs\nfor good measure.\nBryce left him to it, sliding from bed and leaving her room within\nseconds.

And he must have felt\nguilty enough that he\u2019d never questioned why she\u2019d cut him out of her life.\nThat he\u2019d never realized that it hadn\u2019t just been some slight hurt that had\nforced her to shut him off from her life, but fear. Absolute terror.\nHe\u2019d wounded her, and it had scared the Hel out of her that he held\nsuch power. That she had wanted so many things from him, imagined so\nmany things with her brother\u2014adventures and holidays and ordinary\nmoments\u2014and he had the ability to rip it all away.\nBryce\u2019s thumbs hovered over the keyboard on her phone, as if\nsearching for the right words. Thank you would be good. Or even I\u2019ll call\nyou later would suffice, since maybe she should actually say those words\naloud.\nBut her thumbs remained aloft, the words slipping and tumbling past.\nSo she let them fall by, and turned to the other message she\u2019d received\n\u2014from Juniper.\nMadame Kyrah told me that you never showed up to her class. What\nthe Hel, Bryce? I had to beg her to hold that spot for you. She was really\nmad.\nBryce ground her teeth. She wrote back, Sorry. Tell her I\u2019m in the\nmiddle of working on something for the Governor and got called away.\nBryce set down the phone and turned to the coffee machine. Her phone\nbuzzed a second later. Juniper had to be on her way to morning practice,\nthen.\nThis woman does not peddle in excuses. I worked hard to get her to\nlike me, Bryce.\nJune was definitely pissed if she was calling her Bryce instead of B.\nBryce wrote back, I\u2019m sorry, okay? I told you I was a maybe. You\nshouldn\u2019t have let her think I\u2019d be there.\nJuniper sniped back, Whatever. I gotta go.\nBryce blew out a breath, forcing herself to unclench her fingers from\naround her phone. She cradled her mug of hot coffee.\n\u201cHey.\u201d\nShe whirled to find Hunt leaning a hip against the marble island. For\nsomeone heavily muscled and winged, the angel was stealthy, she had to\nadmit. He\u2019d put on a shirt and pants, but his hair was still sleep-mussed.\nShe rasped, her knees wobbling only slightly, \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d\n\u201cFine.\u201d The word held no bite, only a quiet resignation and a request\nnot to push. So Bryce fished out another mug, set it in the coffee machine,\nand hit a few buttons that had it brewing.\nHis gaze brushed over every part of her like a physical touch. She\npeered down at herself and realized why. \u201cSorry I took one of your shirts,\u201d\nshe said, bunching the white fabric in a hand. Gods, she wasn\u2019t wearing any\nunderwear. Did he know?\nHis eyes dipped toward her bare legs and went a shade darker. He\ndefinitely knew.\nHunt pushed off the island, stalking toward her, and Bryce braced\nherself. For what, she didn\u2019t know, but\u2014\nHe just strode past. Right to the fridge, where he pulled out eggs and\nthe slab of bacon. \u201cAt the risk of sounding like an alphahole clich\u00e9,\u201d he said\nwithout looking at her as he set the skillet on the stove, \u201cI like seeing you in\nmy shirt.\u201d\n\u201cTotal alphahole clich\u00e9,\u201d she said, even as her toes curled on the pale\nwood floor.\nHunt cracked the eggs into a bowl. \u201cWe always seem to end up in the\nkitchen.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind,\u201d Bryce said, sipping her coffee, \u201cas long as you\u2019re\ncooking.\u201d\nHunt snorted, then stilled. \u201cThanks,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cFor what you\ndid.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t mention it,\u201d she said, taking another sip of coffee.\nRemembering the one she\u2019d brewed for him, she reached for the now-full\nmug.\nHunt turned from the stove as she extended the coffee to him. Glanced\nbetween the outstretched mug and her face.\nAnd as his large hand wrapped around the mug, he leaned in, closing\nthe space between them. His mouth brushed over her cheek. Brief and light\nand sweet.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d he said again, pulling back and returning to the stove. As\nif he didn\u2019t notice that she couldn\u2019t move a single muscle, couldn\u2019t find a\nsingle word to utter.\nThe urge to grab him, to pull his face down to hers and taste every part\nof him practically blinded her. Her fingers twitched at her sides, nearly able\nto feel those hard muscles beneath them.\nHe had a long-lost love he was still holding a torch for. And she\u2019d just\ngone too long without sex. Cthona\u2019s tits, it\u2019d been weeks since that hookup\nwith the lion shifter in the Raven\u2019s bathroom. And with Hunt here, she\nhadn\u2019t dared open up her left nightstand to take care of herself.\nKeep telling yourself all that, a small voice said.\nThe muscles in Hunt\u2019s back stiffened. His hands paused whatever they\nwere doing.\nShit, he could smell this kind of thing, couldn\u2019t he? Most Vanir males\ncould. The shifts in a person\u2019s scent: fear and arousal being the two big\nones.\nHe was the Umbra Mortis. Off-limits in ten million ways. And the\nUmbra Mortis didn\u2019t date\u2014no, it\u2019d be all or nothing with him.\nHunt asked, voice like gravel, \u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d He\ndidn\u2019t turn from the stove.\nYou. Like a fucking idiot, I\u2019m thinking about you.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a sample sale at one of the designer stores this afternoon,\u201d she\nlied.\nHunt glanced over his shoulder. Fuck, his eyes were dark. \u201cIs that so?\u201d\nWas that a purr in his voice?\nShe couldn\u2019t help the step she took back, bumping into the kitchen\nisland. \u201cYes,\u201d she said, unable to look away.\nHunt\u2019s eyes darkened further. He said nothing.\nShe couldn\u2019t breathe properly with that stare fixed on her. That stare\nthat told her he scented everything going on in her body.\nHer nipples pebbled under that stare.\nHunt went preternaturally still. His eyes dipped downward. Saw her\nbreasts. The thighs she now clamped together\u2014as if it\u2019d stop the throbbing\nbeginning to torture her between them.\nHis face went positively feral. A mountain cat ready to pounce. \u201cI\ndidn\u2019t know clothing sales got you so hot and bothered, Quinlan.\u201d\nShe nearly whimpered. Forced herself to keep still. \u201cIt\u2019s the little\nthings in life, Athalar.\u201d\n\u201cIs that what you think about when you open up that left nightstand?\nClothing sales?\u201d He faced her fully now. She didn\u2019t dare let her gaze drop.\n\u201cYes,\u201d she breathed. \u201cAll those clothes, all over my body.\u201d She had no\nidea what the fuck was coming out of her mouth.\nHow was it possible all the air in the apartment, the city, had been\nsucked out?\n\u201cMaybe you should buy some new underwear,\u201d he murmured, nodding\nto her bare legs. \u201cSeems like you\u2019re out.\u201d\nShe couldn\u2019t stop it\u2014the image that blazed over her senses: Hunt\nputting those big hands on her waist and hoisting her onto the counter\ncurrently pressing into her spine, shoving her T-shirt over her midriff\u2014his\nT-shirt, actually\u2014and spreading her legs wide. Fucking her with his tongue,\nthen his cock, until she was sobbing in pleasure, screaming with it, she\ndidn\u2019t care just so long as he was touching her, inside her\u2014\n\u201cQuinlan.\u201d He seemed to be shaking now. As if only a tether of pure\nwill kept him in place. As if he\u2019d seen the same burning image and was just\nwaiting for her nod.\nIt\u2019d complicate everything. The investigation, whatever he felt for\nShahar, her own life\u2014\nTo fucking Hel with all that. They\u2019d figure it out later. They\u2019d\u2014\nBurning smoke filled the air between them. Gross, nose-stinging\nsmoke.\n\u201cFuck,\u201d Hunt hissed, whirling to the stove and the eggs he\u2019d left on the\nburner.\nAs if a witch spell had snapped, Bryce blinked, the dizzying heat\nvanishing. Oh gods. His emotions had to be all over the place after last\nnight, and hers were a mess on a good day, and\u2014\n\u201cI have to get dressed for work,\u201d she managed to say, and hurried\ntoward her bedroom before he could turn from the burning breakfast.\nShe\u2019d lost her mind, she told herself in the shower, in the bathroom, on the\ntoo-quiet walk to work with Syrinx, Hunt trailing overhead. Keeping his\ndistance. As if he realized the same thing.\nLet someone in, give them the power to hurt you, and they\u2019d do\nexactly that, in the end.\nShe couldn\u2019t do it. Endure it.\nBryce had resigned herself to that fact by the time she reached the\ngallery. A glance upward showed Hunt making his descent as Syrinx yipped\nhappily, and the thought of a day in an enclosed space with him, with only\nLehabah as a buffer \u2026\nThank fucking Urd, her phone rang as she opened the gallery door. But\nit wasn\u2019t Ruhn calling to check in, and it wasn\u2019t Juniper with an earful\nabout missing the dance class. \u201cJesiba.\u201d\nThe sorceress didn\u2019t bother with pleasantries. \u201cGet the back door open.\nNow.\u201d\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s horrible, BB,\u201d Lehabah whispered in the dimness of the library.\n\u201cJust horrible.\u201d\nStaring up at the massive, dimly lit tank, Bryce felt her arm hair stand\non end as she watched their new addition explore its environment. Hunt\ncrossed his arms and peered into the gloom. Any thoughts of getting naked\nwith him had vanished an hour ago.\nA dark, scaled hand slapped against the thick glass, ivory claws\nscraping. Bryce swallowed. \u201cI want to know where anyone even found a\nn\u00f8kk in these waters.\u201d From what she\u2019d heard, they existed only in the icy\nseas of the north, and mostly in Pangera.\n\u201cI preferred the kelpie,\u201d Lehabah whispered, shrinking behind her little\ndivan, her flame a quivering yellow.\nAs if it had heard them, the n\u00f8kk paused before the glass and smiled.\nAt more than eight feet long, the n\u00f8kk might have very well been the\nHelish twin to a mer male. But instead of humanoid features, the n\u00f8kk\npresented a jutting lower jaw with a too-wide, lipless mouth, full of needle-\nthin teeth. Its overlarge eyes were milky, like some of the fishes of the deep.\nIts tail was mostly translucent\u2014bony and sharp\u2014and above it, a warped,\nmuscled torso rose.\nNo hair covered its chest or head, and its four-fingered hands ended in\ndaggerlike claws.\nWith the tank spanning the entire length of one side of the library,\nthere would be no escaping its presence, unless the n\u00f8kk went down to the\ncluster of dark rocks at the bottom. The creature dragged those claws over\nthe glass again. The inked SPQM gleamed stark white on his greenish-gray\nwrist.\nBryce lifted her phone to her ear. Jesiba picked up on the first ring.\n\u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201cWe have a problem.\u201d\n\u201cWith the Korsaki contract?\u201d Jesiba\u2019s voice was low, as if she didn\u2019t\nwant to be overheard.\n\u201cNo.\u201d Bryce scowled at the n\u00f8kk. \u201cThe creep in the aquarium needs to\ngo.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m in a meeting.\u201d\n\u201cLehabah is scared as Hel.\u201d\nAir was lethal to n\u00f8kks\u2014if one was exposed for more than a few\nseconds, its vital organs would begin shutting down, its skin peeling away\nas if burned. But Bryce had still gone up the small stairwell to the right of\nthe tank to ensure that the feeding hatch built into the grate atop the water\nwas thoroughly locked. The hatch itself was a square platform that could be\nraised and lowered into the water, operated by a panel of controls in the rear\nof the space atop the tank, and Bryce had triple-checked that the machine\nwas completely turned off.\nWhen she\u2019d returned to the library, she\u2019d found Lehabah curled into a\nball behind a book, the sprite\u2019s flame a sputtering yellow.\nLehabah whispered from her couch, \u201cHe\u2019s a hateful, horrible creature.\u201d\nBryce shushed her. \u201cCan\u2019t you gift him to some macho loser in\nPangera?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m hanging up now.\u201d\n\u201cBut he\u2019s\u2014\u201d\nThe line went dead. Bryce slumped into her seat at the table. \u201cNow\nshe\u2019ll just keep him forever,\u201d she told the sprite.\n\u201cWhat are you going to feed it?\u201d Hunt asked as the n\u00f8kk again tested\nthe glass wall, feeling with those terrible hands.\n\u201cIt loves humans,\u201d Lehabah whispered. \u201cThey drag swimmers under\nthe surface of ponds and lakes and drown them, then slowly feast on their\ncorpses over days and days\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBeef,\u201d Bryce said, her stomach turning as she glanced at the small\ndoor to access the stairwell to the top of the tank. \u201cHe\u2019ll get a few steaks a\nday.\u201d\nLehabah cowered. \u201cCan\u2019t we put up a curtain?\u201d\n\u201cJesiba will just rip it down.\u201d\nHunt offered, \u201cI could pile some books on this table\u2014block your view\nof him instead.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019ll still know where I am, though.\u201d Lehabah pouted at Bryce. \u201cI\ncan\u2019t sleep with it in here.\u201d\nBryce sighed. \u201cWhat if you just pretend he\u2019s an enchanted prince or\nsomething?\u201d\nThe sprite pointed toward the tank. To the n\u00f8kk hovering in the water,\ntail thrashing. Smiling at them. \u201cA prince from Hel.\u201d\n\u201cWho would want a n\u00f8kk for a pet?\u201d Hunt asked, sprawling himself\nacross from Bryce at the desk.\n\u201cA sorceress who chose to join Flame and Shadow and turns her\nenemies into animals.\u201d Bryce motioned to the smaller tanks and terrariums\nbuilt into the shelves around them, then rubbed at the persistent ache in her\nthigh beneath her pink dress. When she\u2019d finally worked up the nerve to\nemerge from her bedroom this morning after the kitchen fiasco, Hunt had\nlooked at her for a long, long moment. But he\u2019d said nothing.\n\u201cYou should see a medwitch about that leg,\u201d he said now. Hunt didn\u2019t\nlook up from where he was leafing through some report Justinian had sent\nover that morning for a second opinion. She\u2019d asked what it was, but he\u2019d\ntold her it was classified, and that was that.\n\u201cMy leg is fine.\u201d She didn\u2019t bother to turn from where she once again\nbegan typing in the details for the Korsaki contract Jesiba was so eager to\nhave finalized. Mindless busywork, but work that had to be done at some\npoint.\nEspecially since they were again at a dead end. No word had arrived\nfrom Viktoria about the Mimir test results. Why Danika had stolen the\nHorn, who wanted it so badly that they\u2019d kill her for it \u2026 Bryce still had no\nidea. But if Ruhn was right about a method to heal the Horn \u2026 It all had to\ntie together somehow.\nAnd she knew that while they\u2019d killed the one kristallos demon, there\nwere other kristallos waiting in Hel that could still be summoned to hunt the\nHorn. And if its kind had failed so far, when the breed had literally been\ncreated by the Princes of Hel to track the Horn \u2026 How could she even hope\nto find it?\nThen there was the matter of those gruesome, pulping killings \u2026\nwhich hadn\u2019t been done by a kristallos. Hunt had already put in a request to\nhave the footage checked again, but nothing had come through.\nHunt\u2019s phone buzzed, and he fished it from his pocket, glimpsed at the\nscreen, then put it away. From across the desk, she could just barely make\nout the text box of a message on the screen.\n\u201cNot going to write back?\u201d\nHis mouth twisted to the side. \u201cJust one of my colleagues, busting my\nballs.\u201d His eyes flickered when he looked at her, though. And when she\nsmiled at him, shrugging, his throat bobbed\u2014just slightly.\nHunt said a bit roughly, \u201cI gotta head out for a while. Naomi will come\nto stand guard. I\u2019ll pick you up when you\u2019re ready to leave.\u201d\nBefore she could ask about it, he was gone.\n\u201cI know it\u2019s been a while,\u201d Bryce said, her phone wedged between her\nshoulder and ear.\nHunt had been waiting outside the gallery while she locked up, smiling\nat Syrinx scratching at the door. The chimera yowled in protest when he\nrealized Bryce wasn\u2019t bringing him along yet, and Hunt stooped to scratch\nhis fuzzy golden head before Bryce shut the door, locking him in.\n\u201cI\u2019ll have to look at my calendar,\u201d Bryce was saying, nodding her hello\nto Hunt.\nShe looked beautiful today, in a rose-pink dress, pearls at her ears, and\nhair swept back on either side with matching pearl combs.\nFuck, beautiful wasn\u2019t even the right word for it.\nShe\u2019d emerged from her bedroom and he\u2019d been struck stupid.\nShe hadn\u2019t seemed to notice that he\u2019d noticed, though he supposed she\nknew that she looked gorgeous every day. Yet there was a light to her today,\na color that hadn\u2019t been there before, a glow in her amber eyes and flush to\nher skin.\nBut that pink dress \u2026 It had distracted him all day.\nSo had their encounter in the kitchen this morning. He\u2019d done his best\nto ignore it\u2014to forget about how close he\u2019d come to begging her to touch\nhim, to let him touch her. It hadn\u2019t stopped him from being in a state of\nsemi-arousal all day.\nHe had to get his shit together. Considering that their investigation had\nslowed this past week, he couldn\u2019t afford distractions. Couldn\u2019t afford to\nogle her every time she wasn\u2019t looking. This afternoon, she\u2019d been rising up\nonto her toes, arm straining to grab some book on a high shelf in the library,\nand it was like that color pink was the fucking Horn, and he was a kristallos\ndemon.\nHe\u2019d been out of his chair in an instant, at her side a heartbeat after\nthat, and had pulled the book off the shelf for her.\nShe\u2019d stood there, though, when he\u2019d held the book out. Hadn\u2019t backed\nup a step as she looked between the outstretched book and his face. His\nblood had begun pounding in his ears, his skin becoming too tight. Just like\nit had this morning when he\u2019d seen her breasts peak, and had scented how\nfilthy her own thoughts had turned.\nBut she\u2019d just taken the book and walked away. Unfazed and unaware\nof his sheer stupidity.\nIt hadn\u2019t improved as the hours had passed. And when she\u2019d smiled at\nhim earlier \u2026 He\u2019d been half-relieved to be called away from the gallery a\nminute later. It was while he was heading back, breathing in the brisk air off\nthe Istros, that Viktoria sent him a message: I found something. Meet me at\nMunin and Hugin in 15.\nHe debated telling the wraith to wait. To delay the inevitable bad news\ncoming their way, to go just a few more days with that beautiful smile on\nBryce\u2019s face and that desire starting to smolder in her eyes, but \u2026 Micah\u2019s\nwarnings rang in his ears. The Summit was still two weeks away, but Hunt\nknew Sandriel\u2019s presence had stretched Micah\u2019s patience thinner than usual.\nThat if he delayed much longer, he\u2019d find his bargain null and void.\nSo whatever intel Vik had, however bad \u2026 he\u2019d find a way to deal\nwith it. He called Bryce Kicks Ass and told her to get her ass outside to meet\nhim.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Mom,\u201d Bryce was saying into her phone, falling into\nstep with Hunt as they started down the street. The setting sun bathed the\ncity in gold and orange, gilding even the puddles of filth. \u201cOf course I miss\nyou, but maybe next month?\u201d\nThey passed an alley a few blocks away, neon signs pointing to the\nsmall tea bars and ancient food stalls cramming its length. Several tattoo\nshops lay interspersed, some of the artists or patrons smoking outside\nbefore the evening rush of drunken idiots.\n\u201cWhat\u2014this weekend? Well, I have a guest\u2014\u201d She clicked her tongue.\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s a long story. He\u2019s like \u2026 a roommate? His name? Uh, Athie. No,\nMom.\u201d She sighed. \u201cThis weekend really doesn\u2019t work. No, I\u2019m not\nblowing you guys off again.\u201d She gritted her teeth. \u201cWhat about a video\nchat, then? Mmhmm, yeah, of course I\u2019ll make the time.\u201d Bryce winced\nagain. \u201cOkay, Mom. Bye.\u201d\nBryce turned to him, grimacing.\n\u201cYour mom seems \u2026 insistent,\u201d Hunt said carefully.\n\u201cI\u2019m video chatting with my parents at seven.\u201d She sighed at the sky.\n\u201cThey want to meet you.\u201d\nViktoria was at the bar when they arrived, a glass of whiskey in front of her.\nShe offered them both a grave smile, then slid a file over as they seated\nthemselves to her left.\n\u201cWhat did you find?\u201d Bryce asked, opening the cream-colored folder.\n\u201cRead it,\u201d Viktoria said, then glanced toward the cameras in the bar.\nRecording everything.\nBryce nodded, taking the warning, and Hunt leaned closer as her head\ndipped to read, unable to stop himself from stretching out his wing, ever so\nslightly, around her back.\nHe forgot about it, though, when he beheld the test results. \u201cThis can\u2019t\nbe right,\u201d he said quietly.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I said,\u201d Viktoria said, her narrow face impassive.\nThere, on the Fae\u2019s Mimir screening, lay the results: small bits of\nsomething synthetic. Not organic, not technological, not magic\u2014but a\ncombination of all three.\nFind what is in-between, Aidas had said.\n\u201cDanika freelanced for Redner Industries,\u201d Bryce said. \u201cThey do all\nsorts of experiments. Would that explain this?\u201d\n\u201cIt might,\u201d Viktoria said. \u201cBut I\u2019m running the Mimir on every other\nsample we have\u2014from the others. Initial tests also came up positive on\nMaximus Tertian\u2019s clothes.\u201d The tattoo on Viktoria\u2019s brow bunched as she\nfrowned. \u201cIt\u2019s not pure magic, or tech, or organic. It\u2019s a hybrid, with its\nother traces causing it to be canceled out in the other categories. A cloaking\ndevice, almost.\u201d\nBryce frowned. \u201cWhat is it, exactly?\u201d\nHunt knew Viktoria well enough to read the caution in the wraith\u2019s\neyes. She said to Bryce, \u201cIt\u2019s some sort of \u2026 drug. From what I can find, it\nlooks like it\u2019s mostly used for medical purposes in very small doses, but\nmight have leaked onto the streets\u2014which led to doses that are far from\nsafe.\u201d\n\u201cDanika wouldn\u2019t have taken a drug like that.\u201d\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d Viktoria said quickly. \u201cBut she was exposed to it\u2014all\nher clothes were. Whether that was upon her death or before it, however, is\nunclear. We\u2019re about to run the test on the samples we took from the Pack\nof Devils and the two most recent victims.\u201d\n\u201cTertian was in the Meat Market,\u201d Hunt murmured. \u201cHe might have\ntaken it.\u201d\nBut Bryce demanded, \u201cWhat\u2019s it called? This thing?\u201d\nViktoria pointed to the results. \u201cExactly what it sounds like. Synth.\u201d\nBryce whipped her head around to look at Hunt. \u201cRuhn said that\nmedwitch mentioned a synthetic healing compound that could possibly\nrepair \u2026\u201d She didn\u2019t finish the statement.\nHunt\u2019s eyes were dark as the Pit, a haunted look in them. \u201cIt might be\nthe same one.\u201d\nViktoria held up her hands. \u201cAgain, I\u2019m still testing the other victims,\nbut \u2026 I just thought you should know.\u201d\nBryce hopped off the stool. \u201cThanks.\u201d\nHunt let her reach the front door before he murmured to the wraith,\n\u201cKeep it quiet, Vik.\u201d\n\u201cAlready wiped the files from the legion database,\u201d Vik said.\nThey barely spoke while they returned to the gallery, grabbed Syrinx, and\nheaded home. Only when they stood in her kitchen, Hunt leaning against\nthe counter, did he say, \u201cInvestigations can take time. We\u2019re getting closer.\nThat\u2019s a good thing.\u201d\nShe dumped food in Syrinx\u2019s bowl, face unreadable. \u201cWhat do you\nthink about this synth?\u201d\nHunt considered his words carefully. \u201cAs you said, it could have just\nbeen exposure Danika had at Redner. Tertian could have just taken it as a\nrecreational drug right before he died. And we\u2019re still waiting to find out if\nit shows up on the clothes of the remaining victims.\u201d\n\u201cI want to know about it,\u201d she said, pulling out her phone and dialing.\n\u201cIt might not be worth our\u2014\u201d\nRuhn picked up. \u201cYeah?\u201d\n\u201cThat synthetic healing drug you heard about from the medwitch.\nWhat do you know about it?\u201d\n\u201cShe sent over some research a couple days ago. A lot of it\u2019s been\nredacted by Redner Industries, but I\u2019m going through it. Why?\u201d\nBryce glanced toward Hunt\u2019s open bedroom door\u2014to the photo of her\nand Danika on the dresser, Hunt realized. \u201cThere were traces of something\ncalled synth on Danika\u2019s clothes\u2014it\u2019s a relatively new synthetic medicine.\nAnd it sounds like it\u2019s leaked onto the streets and is being used in higher\nconcentrations as an illegal substance. I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s the same\nthing.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, this research is on synth.\u201d Pages rustled in the background. \u201cIt\ncan do some pretty amazing things. There\u2019s a list of ingredients here\u2014\nagain, a lot of it was redacted, but \u2026\u201d\nRuhn\u2019s silence was like a bomb dropping.\n\u201cBut what?\u201d Hunt said into the phone, leaning close enough to hear\nBryce\u2019s thundering heart.\n\u201cObsidian salt is listed as one of the ingredients.\u201d\n\u201cObsidian \u2026\u201d Bryce blinked at Hunt. \u201cCould the synth be used to\nsummon a demon? If someone didn\u2019t have the power on their own, could\nthe obsidian salt in the drug let them call on something like the kristallos?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d Ruhn said. \u201cI\u2019ll read through this and let you know\nwhat I find.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Bryce blew out a breath, and Hunt pulled a step away as she\nbegan pacing again. \u201cThanks, Ruhn.\u201d\nRuhn\u2019s pause was different this time. \u201cNo problem, Bryce.\u201d He hung\nup.\nHunt met her stare. She said, \u201cWe need to figure out who\u2019s selling this\nstuff. Tertian must have known before he died. We\u2019re going to the Meat\nMarket.\u201d Because if there was one place in this city where a drug like that\nmight be available, it\u2019d be in that cesspit.\nHunt swallowed. \u201cWe need to be careful\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI want answers.\u201d She aimed for the front closet.\nHunt stepped into her path. \u201cWe\u2019ll go tomorrow.\u201d She drew up short,\nmouth opening. But Hunt shook his head. \u201cTake tonight off.\u201d\n\u201cIt can\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes, it can wait, Bryce. Talk to your parents tonight. I\u2019ll put on some\nreal clothes,\u201d he added, gesturing to his battle-suit. \u201cAnd then tomorrow,\nwe\u2019ll go to the Meat Market to ask around. It can wait.\u201d Hunt, despite\nhimself, grabbed her hand. Ran his thumb over the back of it. \u201cEnjoy\ntalking to your parents, Bryce. They\u2019re alive. Don\u2019t miss out on a moment\nof it. Not for this.\u201d She still looked like she\u2019d object, insist they go hunt\ndown the synth, so he said, \u201cI wish I had that luxury.\u201d\nShe looked down at his hand, gripping hers, for a second\u2014for a\nlifetime. She asked, \u201cWhat happened to your parents?\u201d\nHe said, throat tight, \u201cMy mother never told me who my father is. And\nshe \u2026 She was a low-ranking angel. She cleaned the villas of some of the\nmore powerful angels, because they didn\u2019t trust humans or other Vanir to do\nit.\u201d His chest ached at the memory of his mother\u2019s beautiful, gentle face.\nHer soft smile and dark, angular eyes. The lullabies he could still hear, more\nthan two hundred years later.\n\u201cShe worked day and night to keep me fed and never once complained,\nbecause she knew that if she did, she\u2019d be out of a job and she had me to\nthink about. When I was a foot soldier, and sending home every copper I\nmade, she refused to spend it. Apparently, someone heard I was doing that,\nthought she had tons of money hidden in her apartment, and broke in one\nnight. Killed her and took the money. All five hundred silver marks she\u2019d\namassed over her life, and the fifty gold marks I\u2019d managed to send her\nafter five years in service.\u201d\n\u201cI am so sorry, Hunt.\u201d\n\u201cNone of the angels\u2014the powerful, adored angels\u2014that my mother\nworked for bothered to care that she\u2019d been killed. No one investigated who\ndid it, and no one granted me leave to mourn. She was nothing to them. But\nshe was \u2026 she was everything to me.\u201d His throat ached. \u201cI made the Drop\nand joined Shahar\u2019s cause soon after that. I battled on Mount Hermon that\nday for her\u2014my mother. In her memory.\u201d Shahar had taken those memories\nand made them into weapons.\nBryce\u2019s fingers pressed his. \u201cIt sounds like she was a remarkable\nperson.\u201d\n\u201cShe was.\u201d He pulled his hand away at last.\nBut she still smiled at him, his chest tightening to the point of pain as\nshe said, \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll video chat my parents. Playing legionary with you\ncan wait.\u201d\nBryce spent most of the evening cleaning. Hunt helped her, offering to fly\nover to the nearest apothecary and get an insta-clean spell, but Bryce waved\nhim off. Her mom was such a neat freak, she claimed, that she could tell the\ndifference between magically cleaned bathrooms and hand-scrubbed ones.\nEven on video chat.\nIt\u2019s that bleach smell that tells me it\u2019s been done properly, Bryce, her\ndaughter had imitated to Hunt in a flat, no-nonsense voice that made him\njust a little nervous.\nBryce had used his phone throughout, snapping photos of him\ncleaning, of Syrinx taking the toilet paper rolls from their container and\nshredding them on the carpet they\u2019d just vacuumed, of herself with Hunt\nstooped over his toilet behind her, brushing down the inside.\nBy the time he\u2019d snatched the phone out of her gloved hands, she\u2019d\nagain changed her contact name, this time to Bryce Is Cooler Than Me.\nBut despite the smile it brought to his face, Hunt kept hearing Micah\u2019s\nvoice, threats both spoken and implied. Find who is behind this. Get. The.\nJob. Done. Don\u2019t make me reconsider our bargain. Before I take you off this\ncase. Before I sell you back to Sandriel. Before I make you and Bryce\nQuinlan regret it.\nOnce he solved this case, it would be over, wouldn\u2019t it? He\u2019d still have\nten kills left for Micah, which could easily take years to fulfill. He\u2019d have to\ngo back to the Comitium. To the 33rd.\nHe found himself looking at her while they cleaned. Taking out his\nphone and snapping some photos of her as well.\nHe knew too much. Had learned too much. About all of it. About what\nhe might have had, without the halo and slave tattoos.\n\u201cI can open a bottle of wine, if you need some liquid courage,\u201d Bryce\nwas saying as they sat before her computer at the kitchen island, the video\nchat service dialing her parents. She\u2019d bought a bag of pastries from the\ncorner market on their way home\u2014a stress-coping device, he assumed.\nHunt just scanned her face. This\u2014calling her parents, sitting thigh-to-\nthigh with her \u2026 Fucking Hel.\nHe was on a one-way collision course. He couldn\u2019t bring himself to\nstop it.\nBefore Hunt could open his mouth to suggest that this might be a\nmistake, a female voice said, \u201cAnd why exactly would he need liquid\ncourage, Bryce Adelaide Quinlan?\u201d"}, "56": {"Name": "PART III THE CANYON-Chapter 56", "Page Content": " 6 \nA stunning woman in her mid-forties appeared on the screen, her sheet of\nblack hair still untouched by gray, her freckled face just beginning to show\nthe signs of a mortal life span.\nFrom what Hunt could see, Ember Quinlan was seated on a worn green\ncouch situated against oak-paneled walls, her long, jeans-clad legs folded\nbeneath her.\nBryce rolled her eyes. \u201cI\u2019d say most people need liquid courage when\ndealing with you, Mom.\u201d But she smiled. One of those broad smiles that did\nfunny things to Hunt\u2019s sense of balance.\nEmber\u2019s dark eyes shifted toward Hunt. \u201cI think Bryce is confusing me\nwith herself.\u201d\nBryce waved off the comment. \u201cWhere\u2019s Dad?\u201d\n\u201cHe had a long day at work\u2014he\u2019s making some coffee so he doesn\u2019t\nfall asleep.\u201d\nEven through the video feed, Ember possessed a grounded sort of\npresence that commanded attention. She said, \u201cYou must be Athie.\u201d\nBefore he could answer, a male eased onto the couch beside Ember.\nBryce beamed in a way Hunt hadn\u2019t seen before. \u201cHey, Dad.\u201d\nRandall Silago held two coffees, one of which he handed to Ember as\nhe grinned back at his daughter. Unlike his wife, the years or the war had\nleft their mark on him: his black braided hair was streaked with silver, his\nbrown skin marred with a few brutal scars. But his dark eyes were friendly\nas he sipped from his mug\u2014a chipped white one that said Insert Clich\u00e9\nDad Joke Here. \u201cI\u2019m still scared of that fancy coffee machine you bought\nus for Winter Solstice,\u201d he said by way of greeting.\n\u201cI\u2019ve shown you how to use it literally three times.\u201d\nHer mother chuckled, toying with a silver pendant around her neck.\n\u201cHe\u2019s old-school.\u201d\nHunt had looked up how much the built-in machine in this apartment\ncost\u2014if Bryce had bought them anything remotely similar, she must have\ndumped a considerable portion of her paycheck on it. Money she did not\nhave. Not with her debt to Jesiba.\nHe doubted her parents knew that, doubted they\u2019d have accepted that\nmachine if they\u2019d known the money could have gone toward paying back\nher debts to the sorceress.\nRandall\u2019s eyes shifted to Hunt, the warmth cooling to something\nharder. The eyes of the fabled sharpshooter\u2014the man who\u2019d taught his\ndaughter how to defend herself. \u201cYou must be Bryce\u2019s sort-of roommate.\u201d\nHunt saw the man notice his tattoos\u2014on his brow, on his wrist. Recognition\nflared across Randall\u2019s face.\nYet he didn\u2019t sneer. Didn\u2019t cringe.\nBryce elbowed Hunt in the ribs, reminding him to actually speak. \u201cI\u2019m\nHunt Athalar,\u201d he said, glancing at Bryce. \u201cOr Athie, as she and Lehabah\ncall me.\u201d\nRandall slowly set down his coffee. Yeah, that had been recognition in\nthe man\u2019s face a moment ago. But Randall narrowed his eyes at his\ndaughter. \u201cYou were going to mention this when, exactly?\u201d\nBryce rootled through the pastry bag on the counter and pulled out a\nchocolate croissant. She bit in and said around it, \u201cHe\u2019s not as cool as you\nthink, Dad.\u201d\nHunt snorted. \u201cThanks.\u201d\nEmber said nothing. Didn\u2019t even move. But she watched every bite\nBryce took.\nRandall met Hunt\u2019s stare through the feed. \u201cYou were stationed at\nMeridan when I was over there. I was running recon the day you took on\nthat battalion.\u201d\n\u201cRough battle\u201d was all Hunt said.\nShadows darkened Randall\u2019s eyes. \u201cYeah, it was.\u201d\nHunt shut out the memory of that one-sided massacre, of how many\nhumans and their few Vanir allies hadn\u2019t walked away from his sword or\nlightning. He\u2019d been serving Sandriel then, and her orders had been brutal:\nno prisoners. She\u2019d sent him and Pollux out that day, ahead of her legion, to\nintercept the small rebel force camped in a mountain pass.\nHunt had worked around her order as best he could. He\u2019d made the\ndeaths quick.\nPollux had taken his time. And enjoyed every second of it.\nAnd when Hunt could no longer listen to people screaming for\nPollux\u2019s mercy, he\u2019d ended their lives, too. Pollux had raged, the brawl\nbetween them leaving both angels spitting blood onto the rocky earth.\nSandriel had been delighted by it, even if she\u2019d thrown Hunt into her\ndungeons for a few days as punishment for ending Pollux\u2019s fun too soon.\nBeneath the counter, Bryce brushed her crumb-covered hand over\nHunt\u2019s. There had been no one, after that battle, to wash away the blood and\nput him in bed. Would it have been better or worse to have known Bryce\nthen? To have fought, knowing he could return to her?\nBryce squeezed his fingers, leaving a trail of buttery flakes, and\nopened the bag for a second croissant.\nEmber watched her daughter dig through the pastries and again toyed\nwith the silver pendant\u2014a circle set atop two triangles. The Embrace, Hunt\nrealized. The union of Solas and Cthona. Ember frowned. \u201cWhy,\u201d she asked\nBryce, \u201cis Hunt Athalar your roommate?\u201d\n\u201cHe was booted from the 33rd for his questionable fashion sense,\u201d she\nsaid, munching on the croissant. \u201cI told him his boring black clothes don\u2019t\nbother me, and let him stay here.\u201d\nEmber rolled her eyes. The exact same expression he\u2019d seen on\nBryce\u2019s face moments before. \u201cDo you ever manage to get a straight answer\nout of her, Hunt? Because I\u2019ve known her for twenty-five years and she\u2019s\nnever given me one.\u201d\nBryce glared at her mother, then turned to Hunt. \u201cDo not feel obligated\nto answer that.\u201d\nEmber let out an outraged click of her tongue. \u201cI wish I could say that\nthe big city corrupted my lovely daughter, but she was this rude even before\nshe left for university.\u201d\nHunt couldn\u2019t help his low chuckle. Randall leaned back on the couch.\n\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d Randall said. \u201cYou should have seen their fights. I don\u2019t think\nthere was a single person in Nidaros who didn\u2019t hear them hollering at each\nother. It echoed off the gods-damned mountains.\u201d\nBoth Quinlan women scowled at him. That expression was the same,\ntoo.\nEmber seemed to peer over their shoulders. \u201cWhen was the last time\nyou cleaned, Bryce Adelaide Quinlan?\u201d\nBryce stiffened. \u201cTwenty minutes ago.\u201d\n\u201cI can see dust on that coffee table.\u201d\n\u201cYou. Can. Not.\u201d\nEmber\u2019s eyes danced with devilish delight. \u201cDoes Athie know about\nJJ?\u201d\nHunt couldn\u2019t stop himself from going rigid. JJ\u2014an ex? She hadn\u2019t\never mentioned\u2014Oh. Right. Hunt smirked. \u201cJelly Jubilee and I are good\nfriends.\u201d\nBryce grumbled something he chose not to hear.\nEmber leaned closer to the screen. \u201cAll right, Hunt. If she showed you\nJJ, then she\u2019s got to like you.\u201d Bryce, mercifully, refrained from mentioning\nto her parents how he\u2019d discovered her doll collection in the first place.\nEmber continued, \u201cSo tell me about yourself.\u201d\nRandall said flatly to his wife. \u201cHe\u2019s Hunt Athalar.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Ember said. \u201cBut all I\u2019ve heard are horrible war stories. I\nwant to know about the real male. And get a straight answer about why\nyou\u2019re living in my daughter\u2019s guest room.\u201d\nBryce had warned him while they cleaned: Do not say a word about\nthe murders.\nBut he had a feeling that Ember Quinlan could sniff out lies like a\nbloodhound, so Hunt smudged the truth. \u201cJesiba is working with my boss to\nfind a stolen relic. With the Summit happening in two weeks, the barracks\nare overloaded with guests, so Bryce generously offered me a room to make\nworking together easier.\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d Ember said. \u201cMy daughter, who never once shared her\nprecious Starlight Fancy toys with a single kid in Nidaros, but only let them\nlook at the stupid things, offered up the entire guest room of her own\ngoodwill.\u201d\nRandall nudged his wife with a knee, a silent warning, perhaps, of a\nman used to keeping the peace between two highly opinionated women.\nBryce said, \u201cThis is why I told him to have a drink before we dialed\nyou.\u201d\nEmber sipped from her coffee. Randall picked up a newspaper from\nthe table and began to flip through it. Ember asked, \u201cSo you won\u2019t let us\ncome visit this weekend because of this case?\u201d\nBryce winced. \u201cYes. It\u2019s not the sort of thing you guys could tag along\non.\u201d\nA hint of the warrior shone through as Randall\u2019s eyes sharpened. \u201cIt\u2019s\ndangerous?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Bryce lied. \u201cBut we need to be a little stealthy.\u201d\n\u201cAnd bringing along two humans,\u201d Ember said testily, \u201cis the opposite\nof that?\u201d\nBryce sighed at the ceiling. \u201cBringing along my parents,\u201d she\ncountered, \u201cwould undermine my image as a cool antiquities dealer.\u201d\n\u201cAssistant antiquities dealer,\u201d her mother corrected.\n\u201cEmber,\u201d Randall warned.\nBryce\u2019s mouth tightened. Apparently, this was a conversation they\u2019d\nhad before. He wondered if Ember saw the flicker of hurt in her daughter\u2019s\neyes.\nIt was enough that Hunt found himself saying, \u201cBryce knows more\npeople in this city than I do\u2014she\u2019s a pro at navigating all this. She\u2019s a real\nasset to the 33rd.\u201d\nEmber considered him, her gaze frank. \u201cMicah is your boss, isn\u2019t he?\u201d\nA polite way of putting what Micah was to him.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Hunt said. Randall was watching him now. \u201cThe best I\u2019ve\nhad.\u201d\nEmber\u2019s stare fell on the tattoo across his brow. \u201cThat\u2019s not saying\nmuch.\u201d\n\u201cMom, can we not?\u201d Bryce sighed. \u201cHow\u2019s the pottery business?\u201d\nEmber opened her mouth, but Randall nudged her knee again, a silent\nplea to let it drop. \u201cBusiness,\u201d Ember said tightly, \u201cis going great.\u201d\nBryce knew her mother was a brewing tempest.\nHunt was kind to them, friendly even, well aware that her mom was\nnow on a mission to figure out why he was here, and what existed between\nthem. But he asked Randall about his job as co-head of an organization to\nhelp humans traumatized by their military service and asked her mom about\nher roadside stand selling pottery of fat babies lolling in various beds of\nvegetables.\nHer mom and Hunt were currently debating which sunball players\nwere best this season, and Randall was still flipping through the newspaper\nand chiming in every now and then.\nIt had gutted her to hear what had happened to Hunt\u2019s own mother. She\nkept the call going longer than usual because of it. Because he was right.\nRubbing her aching leg beneath the table\u2014she\u2019d strained it again at some\npoint during their cleaning\u2014Bryce dug into her third croissant and said to\nRandall, \u201cThis still isn\u2019t as good as yours.\u201d\n\u201cMove back home,\u201d her dad said, \u201cand you could have them every\nday.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d she said, eating another mouthful. She massaged her\nthigh. \u201cI thought you were supposed to be the cool parent. You\u2019ve become\neven worse than Mom with the nagging.\u201d\n\u201cI was always worse than your mother,\u201d he said mildly. \u201cI was just\nbetter at hiding it.\u201d\nBryce said to Hunt, \u201cThis is why my parents have to ambush me if\nthey want to visit. I\u2019d never let them through the door.\u201d\nHunt just glanced at her lap\u2014her thigh\u2014before he asked Ember,\n\u201cHave you tried to get her to a medwitch for that leg?\u201d\nBryce froze at exactly the same heartbeat as her mother.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with her leg?\u201d Ember\u2019s eyes dropped to the lower half\nof her screen as if she could somehow see Bryce\u2019s leg beneath the camera\u2019s\nrange, Randall following suit.\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Bryce said, glaring at Hunt. \u201cA busybody angel, that\u2019s\nwhat.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s the wound she got two years ago,\u201d Hunt answered. \u201cIt still hurts\nher.\u201d He rustled his wings, as if unable to help the impatient gesture. \u201cAnd\nshe still insists on running.\u201d\nEmber\u2019s eyes filled with alarm. \u201cWhy would you do that, Bryce?\u201d\nBryce set down her croissant. \u201cIt\u2019s none of anyone\u2019s business.\u201d\n\u201cBryce,\u201d Randall said. \u201cIf it bothers you, you should see a medwitch.\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t bother me,\u201d Bryce said through her teeth.\n\u201cThen why have you been rubbing your leg under the counter?\u201d Hunt\ndrawled.\n\u201cBecause I was trying to convince it not to kick you in the face,\nasshole,\u201d Bryce hissed.\n\u201cBryce,\u201d her mother gasped. Randall\u2019s eyes widened.\nBut Hunt laughed. He rose, picking up the empty pastry bag and\nsquishing it into a ball before tossing it into the trash can with the skill of\none of his beloved sunball players. \u201cI think the wound still has venom\nlingering from the demon who attacked her. If she doesn\u2019t get it checked out\nbefore the Drop, she\u2019ll be in pain for centuries.\u201d\nBryce shot to her feet, hiding her wince at the ripple of pain in her\nthigh. They\u2019d never discussed it\u2014that the kristallos\u2019s venom might indeed\nstill be in her leg. \u201cI don\u2019t need you deciding what is best for me, you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAlphahole?\u201d Hunt supplied, going to the sink and turning on the\nwater. \u201cWe\u2019re partners. Partners look out for each other. If you won\u2019t listen\nto me about your gods-damned leg, then maybe you\u2019ll listen to your\nparents.\u201d\n\u201cHow bad is it?\u201d Randall asked quietly.\nBryce whirled back to the computer. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d\nRandall pointed to the floor behind her. \u201cBalance on that leg and tell\nme that again.\u201d\nBryce refused to move. Filling a glass of water, Hunt smiled, pure\nmale satisfaction.\nEmber reached for her phone, which she\u2019d discarded on the cushions\nbeside her. \u201cI\u2019ll find the nearest medwitch and see if she can squeeze you in\ntomorrow\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI am not going to a medwitch,\u201d Bryce snarled, and grabbed the rim of\nthe laptop. \u201cIt was great chatting with you. I\u2019m tired. Good night.\u201d\nRandall began to object, eyes shooting daggers at Ember, but Bryce\nslammed the laptop shut.\nAt the sink, Hunt was the portrait of smug, angelic arrogance. She\naimed for her bedroom.\nEmber, at least, waited two minutes before video-calling Bryce on her\nphone.\n\u201cIs your father behind this case?\u201d Ember asked, venom coating each\nword. Even through the camera, her rage was palpable.\n\u201cRandall is not behind this,\u201d Bryce said dryly, flopping onto her bed.\n\u201cYour other father,\u201d Ember snapped. \u201cThis sort of arrangement reeks\nof him.\u201d\nBryce kept her face neutral. \u201cNo. Jesiba and Micah are working\ntogether. Hunt and I are mere pawns.\u201d\n\u201cMicah Domitus is a monster,\u201d Ember breathed.\n\u201cAll the Archangels are. He\u2019s an arrogant ass, but not that bad.\u201d\nEmber\u2019s eyes simmered. \u201cAre you being careful?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m still taking birth control, yes.\u201d\n\u201cBryce Adelaide Quinlan, you know what I mean.\u201d\n\u201cHunt has my back.\u201d Even if he\u2019d thrown her under the bus by\nmentioning her leg to them.\nHer mom was having none of it. \u201cI have no doubt that sorceress would\npush you into harm\u2019s way if it made her more money. Micah\u2019s no better.\nHunt might have your back, but don\u2019t forget that these Vanir only look out\nfor themselves. He\u2019s Micah\u2019s personal assassin, for fuck\u2019s sake. And one of\nthe Fallen. The Asteri hate him. He\u2019s a slave because of it.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s a slave because we live in a fucked-up world.\u201d Hazy wrath\nfogged her vision, but she blinked it away.\nHer dad called out from the kitchen, asking where the microwave\npopcorn was. Ember hollered back that it was in the same exact place it\nalways was, her eyes never leaving the phone\u2019s camera. \u201cI know you\u2019ll bite\nmy head off for it, but let me just say this.\u201d\n\u201cGods, Mom\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHunt might be a good roommate, and he might be nice to look at, but\nremember that he\u2019s a Vanir male. A very, very powerful Vanir male, even\nwith those tattoos keeping him in line. He and every male like him is\nlethal.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, and you never let me forget it.\u201d It was an effort not to look at\nthe tiny scar on her mom\u2019s cheekbone.\nOld shadows banked the light in her mom\u2019s eyes, and Bryce winced.\n\u201cSeeing you with an older Vanir male\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not with him, Mom\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt brings me back to that place, Bryce.\u201d She ran a hand through her\ndark hair. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nHer mom might as well have punched her in the heart.\nBryce wished she could reach through the camera and wrap her arms\naround her, breathing in her honeysuckle-and-nutmeg scent.\nThen Ember said, \u201cI\u2019ll make some calls and get that medwitch\nappointment for your leg.\u201d\nBryce scowled. \u201cNo, thanks.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to that appointment, Bryce.\u201d\nBryce turned the phone and stretched out her leg over the covers so her\nmother could see. She rotated her foot. \u201cSee? No problems.\u201d\nHer mother\u2019s face hardened to steel that matched the wedding band on\nher finger. \u201cJust because Danika died doesn\u2019t mean you need to suffer, too.\u201d\nBryce stared at her mother, who was always so good at cutting to the\nheart of everything, at rendering her into rubble with a few words. \u201cIt\ndoesn\u2019t have anything to do with that.\u201d\n\u201cBullshit, Bryce.\u201d Her mom\u2019s eyes glazed with tears. \u201cYou think\nDanika would want you limping in pain for the rest of your existence? You\nthink she would\u2019ve wanted you to stop dancing?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about Danika.\u201d Her voice trembled.\nEmber shook her head in disgust. \u201cI\u2019ll message the medwitch\u2019s address\nand number when I get the appointment for you. Good night.\u201d\nShe hung up without another word."}, "57": {"Name": "PART III THE CANYON-Chapter 57", "Page Content": " 7 \nThirty minutes later, Bryce had changed into her sleep shorts and was\nbrooding on her bed when a knock thumped on the door. \u201cYou\u2019re a fucking\ntraitor, Athalar,\u201d she called.\nHunt opened the door and leaned against its frame. \u201cNo wonder you\nmoved here, if you and your mom fight so much.\u201d\nThe instinct to strangle him was overwhelming, but she said, \u201cI\u2019ve\nnever seen my mom back down from a fight. It rubbed off, I guess.\u201d She\nscowled at him. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\nHunt pushed off the door and approached. The room became too small\nwith each step closer. Too airless. He stopped at the foot of her mattress.\n\u201cI\u2019ll go to the medwitch appointment with you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not going.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\nShe sucked in a breath. And then it all burst out. \u201cBecause once that\nwound is gone, once it stops hurting, then Danika is gone. The Pack of\nDevils is gone.\u201d She shoved back the blankets, revealing her bare legs, and\nhitched up her silk sleep shorts so the full, twisting scar was visible. \u201cIt will\nall be some memory, some dream that happened for a flash and then was\ngone. But this scar and the pain \u2026\u201d Her eyes stung. \u201cI can\u2019t let it be erased.\nI can\u2019t let them be erased.\u201d\nHunt slowly sat beside her on the bed, as if giving her time to object.\nHis hair skimmed his brow, the tattoo, as he studied the scar. And ran a\ncalloused finger over it.\nThe touch left her skin prickling in its wake.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to erase Danika and the pack if you help yourself.\u201d\nBryce shook her head, looking toward the window, but his fingers\nclosed around her chin. He gently turned her face back to his. His dark,\ndepthless eyes were soft. Understanding.\nHow many people ever saw those eyes this way? Ever saw him this\nway?\n\u201cYour mother loves you. She cannot\u2014literally, on a biological level,\nBryce\u2014bear the thought of you in pain.\u201d He let go of her chin, but his eyes\nremained on hers. \u201cNeither can I.\u201d\n\u201cYou barely know me.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re my friend.\u201d The words hung between them. His head dipped\nagain, as if he could hide the expression on his face as he amended, \u201cIf you\nwould like me to be.\u201d\nFor a moment, she stared at him. The offer thrown out there. The quiet\nvulnerability. It erased any annoyance still in her veins.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you know, Athalar?\u201d The tentative hope in his face nearly\ndestroyed her. \u201cWe\u2019ve been friends from the moment you thought Jelly\nJubilee was a dildo.\u201d\nHe tipped back his head and laughed, and Bryce scooted back on the\nbed. Propped up the pillows and turned on the TV. She patted the space\nbeside her.\nGrinning, eyes full of light in a way she\u2019d never seen before, he sat\nbeside her. Then he pulled out his phone and snapped a picture of her.\nBryce blew out a breath, her smile fading as she surveyed him. \u201cMy\nmom went through a lot. I know she\u2019s not easy to deal with, but thanks for\nbeing so cool with her.\u201d\n\u201cI like your mom,\u201d Hunt said, and she believed him. \u201cHow\u2019d she and\nyour dad meet?\u201d\nBryce knew he meant Randall. \u201cMy mom ran from my biological\nfather before he found out she was pregnant. She wound up at a temple to\nCthona in Korinth, and knew the priestesses there would take her in\u2014shield\nher\u2014since she was a holy pregnant vessel or whatever.\u201d Bryce snorted.\n\u201cShe gave birth to me there, and I spent the first three years of my life\ncloistered behind the temple walls. My mom did their laundry to earn our\nkeep. Long story short, my biological father heard a rumor that she had a\nchild and sent goons to hunt her down.\u201d She ground her teeth. \u201cHe told\nthem that if there was a child that was undoubtedly his, they were to bring\nme to him. At any cost.\u201d\nHunt\u2019s mouth thinned. \u201cShit.\u201d\n\u201cThey had eyes at every depot, but the priestesses got us out of the city\n\u2014with the hope of getting us all the way to the House of Earth and Blood\nheadquarters in Hilene, where my mom could beg for asylum. Even my\nfather wouldn\u2019t dare infringe on their territory. But it\u2019s a three days\u2019 drive,\nand none of the Korinth priestesses had the ability to defend us against Fae\nwarriors. So we drove the five hours to Solas\u2019s Temple in Oia, partially to\nrest, but also to pick up our holy guard.\u201d\n\u201cRandall.\u201d Hunt smiled. But he arched a brow. \u201cWait\u2014Randall was a\nsun-priest?\u201d\n\u201cNot quite. He\u2019d gotten back from the front a year before, but the stuff\nhe did and saw while he was serving \u2026 It messed with him. Really badly.\nHe didn\u2019t want to go home, couldn\u2019t face his family. So he\u2019d offered\nhimself as an acolyte to Solas, hoping that it\u2019d somehow atone for his past.\nHe was two weeks away from swearing his vows when the High Priest\nasked him to escort us to Hilene. Many of the priests are trained warriors,\nbut Randall was the only human, and the High Priest guessed my mother\nwouldn\u2019t trust a Vanir male. Right before we reached Hilene, my father\u2019s\npeople caught up with us. They expected to find a helpless, hysterical\nfemale.\u201d Bryce smiled again. \u201cWhat they found was a legendary\nsharpshooter and a mother who would move the earth itself to keep her\ndaughter.\u201d\nHunt straightened. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n\u201cWhat you might expect. My parents dealt with the mess afterward.\u201d\nShe glanced at him. \u201cPlease don\u2019t tell that to anyone. It \u2026 There were never\nany questions about the Fae that didn\u2019t return to Crescent City. I don\u2019t want\nany to come up now.\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t say a word.\u201d\nBryce smiled grimly. \u201cAfter that, the House of Earth and Blood\nliterally deemed my mother a vessel for Cthona and Randall a vessel for\nSolas, and blah blah religious crap, but it basically amounted to an official\norder of protection that my father didn\u2019t dare fuck with. And Randall finally\nwent home, bringing us with him, and obviously didn\u2019t swear his vows to\nSolas.\u201d Her smile warmed. \u201cHe proposed by the end of the year. They\u2019ve\nbeen disgustingly in love ever since.\u201d\nHunt smiled back. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to hear that sometimes things work out for\ngood people.\u201d\n\u201cYeah. Sometimes.\u201d A taut silence stretched between them. In her bed\n\u2014they were in her bed, and just this morning, she\u2019d fantasized about him\ngoing down on her atop the kitchen counter\u2014\nBryce swallowed hard. \u201cFangs and Bangs is on in five minutes. You\nwant to watch?\u201d\nHunt smiled slowly, as if he knew precisely why she\u2019d swallowed, but\nlay back on the pillows, his wings sprawled beneath him. A predator content\nto wait for his prey to come to him.\nFucking Hel. But Hunt winked at her, tucking an arm behind his head.\nThe motion made the muscles down his biceps ripple. His eyes glittered, as\nif he was well aware of that, too. \u201cHel yes.\u201d\nHunt hadn\u2019t realized how badly he needed to ask it. How badly he\u2019d needed\nher answer.\nFriends. It didn\u2019t remotely cover whatever was between them, but it\nwas true.\nHe leaned against the towering headboard, the two of them watching\nthe raunchy show. But by the time they reached the halfway point of the\nepisode, she\u2019d begun to make comments about the inane plot. And he\u2019d\nbegun to join her.\nAnother show came on, a reality competition with different Vanir\nperforming feats of strength and agility, and it felt only natural to watch\nthat, too. All of it felt only natural. He let himself settle into the feeling.\nAnd wasn\u2019t that the most dangerous thing he\u2019d ever done."}, "58": {"Name": "PART III THE CANYON-Chapter 58", "Page Content": " 8 \nHer mother messaged while she was dressing for work the next morning,\nwith the time and location of a medwitch appointment.

She certainly wouldn\u2019t be going to the\nappointment.\nNot when she had another one scheduled with the Meat Market.\nHunt had wanted to wait until night, but Bryce knew that the vendors\nwould be much more likely to chat during the quieter daytime hours, when\nthey wouldn\u2019t be trying to entice the usual evening buyers.\n\u201cYou\u2019re quiet again today,\u201d Bryce murmured as they wove through the\ncramped pathways of the warehouse. This was the third they\u2019d visited so far\n\u2014the other two had quickly proven fruitless.\nNo, the vendors didn\u2019t know anything about drugs. No, that was a\nstereotype of the Meat Market that they did not appreciate. No, they did not\nknow anyone who might help them. No, they were not interested in marks\nfor information, because they really did not know anything useful at all.\nHunt had stayed a few stalls away during every discussion, because no\none would talk with a legionary and Fallen slave.\nHunt held his wings tucked in tight. \u201cDon\u2019t think I\u2019ve forgotten that\nwe\u2019re missing that medwitch appointment right now.\u201d\nShe never should have mentioned it.\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember giving you permission to shove your nose into my\nbusiness.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re back to that?\u201d He huffed a laugh. \u201cI\u2019d think cuddling in front\nof the TV allowed me to at least be able to voice my opinions without\ngetting my head bitten off.\u201d\nShe rolled her eyes. \u201cWe didn\u2019t cuddle.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is it you want, exactly?\u201d Hunt asked, surveying a stall full of\nancient knives. \u201cA boyfriend or mate or husband who will just sit there,\nwith no opinions, and agree to everything you say, and never dare to ask\nyou for anything?\u201d\n\u201cOf course not.\u201d\n\u201cJust because I\u2019m male and have an opinion doesn\u2019t make me into\nsome psychotic, domineering prick.\u201d\nShe shoved her hands into the pockets of Danika\u2019s leather jacket.\n\u201cLook, my mom went through a lot thanks to some psychotic, domineering\npricks.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d His eyes softened. \u201cBut even so, look at her and your dad.\nHe voices his opinions. And he seems pretty damn psychotic when it comes\nto protecting both of you.\u201d\n\u201cYou have no idea,\u201d Bryce grumbled. \u201cI didn\u2019t go on a single date until\nI got to CCU.\u201d\nHunt\u2019s brows rose. \u201cReally? I would have thought \u2026\u201d He shook his\nhead.\n\u201cThought what?\u201d\nHe shrugged. \u201cThat the human boys would have been crawling around\nafter you.\u201d\nIt was an effort not to glance at him, with the way he said human boys,\nas if they were some other breed than him\u2014a full-grown malakh male.\nShe supposed they were, technically, but that hint of masculine\narrogance \u2026 \u201cWell, if they wanted to, they didn\u2019t dare show it. Randall was\npractically a god to them, and though he never said anything, they all got it\ninto their heads that I was firmly off-limits.\u201d\n\u201cThat wouldn\u2019t have been a good enough reason for me to stay away.\u201d\nHer cheeks heated at the way his voice lowered. \u201cWell, idolizing\nRandall aside, I was also different.\u201d She gestured to her pointed ears. Her\ntall body. \u201cToo Fae for humans. Woe is me, right?\u201d\n\u201cIt builds character,\u201d he said, examining a stall full of opals of every\ncolor: white, black, red, blue, green. Iridescent veins ran through them, like\npreserved arteries from the earth itself.\n\u201cWhat are these for?\u201d he asked the black-feathered, humanoid female\nat the stall. A magpie.\n\u201cThey\u2019re luck charms,\u201d the magpie said, waving a feathery hand over\nthe trays of gems. \u201cWhite is for joy; green for wealth; red for love and\nfertility; blue for wisdom \u2026 Take your pick.\u201d\nHunt asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the black for?\u201d\nThe magpie\u2019s onyx-colored mouth curved upward. \u201cFor the opposite\nof luck.\u201d She tapped one of the black opals, kept contained within a glass\ndome. \u201cSlip it under the pillow of your enemy and see what happens to\nthem.\u201d\nBryce cleared her throat. \u201cInteresting as that may be\u2014\u201d\nHunt held out a silver mark. \u201cFor the white.\u201d\nBryce\u2019s brows rose, but the magpie swept up the mark, and plunked\nthe white opal into Hunt\u2019s awaiting palm. They left, ignoring her gratitude\nfor their business.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t peg you for superstitious,\u201d Bryce said.\nBut Hunt paused at the end of the row of stalls and took her hand. He\npressed the opal into it, the stone warm from his touch. The size of a crow\u2019s\negg, it shimmered in the firstlights high above.\n\u201cYou could use some joy,\u201d Hunt said quietly.\nSomething bright sparked in her chest. \u201cSo could you,\u201d she said,\nattempting to press the opal back into his palm.\nBut Hunt stepped away. \u201cIt\u2019s a gift.\u201d\nBryce\u2019s face warmed again, and she looked anywhere but at him as she\nsmiled. Even though she could feel his gaze lingering on her face while she\nslid the opal into the pocket of her jacket.\nThe opal had been stupid. Impulsive.\nLikely bullshit, but Bryce had pocketed it, at least. She hadn\u2019t\ncommented on how rusty his skills were, since it had been two hundred\nyears since he\u2019d last thought to buy something for a female.\nShahar would have smiled at the opal\u2014and forgotten about it soon\nafter. She\u2019d had troves of jewels in her alabaster palace: diamonds the size\nof sunballs; solid blocks of emerald stacked like bricks; veritable bathtubs\nfilled with rubies. A small white opal, even for joy, would have been like a\ngrain of sand on a miles-long beach. She\u2019d have appreciated the gift but,\nultimately, let it disappear into a drawer somewhere. And he, so dedicated\nto their cause, would probably have forgotten about it, too.\nHunt clenched his jaw as Bryce strode for a hide stall. The teenager\u2014a\nfeline shifter from her scent\u2014was in her lanky humanoid form and watched\nthem approach from where she perched on a stool. Her brown braid draped\nover a shoulder, nearly grazing the phone idly held in her hands.\n\u201cHey,\u201d Bryce said, pointing toward a pile of shaggy rugs. \u201cHow much\nfor one of them?\u201d\n\u201cTwenty silvers,\u201d the shifter said, sounding as bored as she looked.\nBryce smirked, running a hand over the white pelt. Hunt\u2019s skin\ntightened over his bones. He\u2019d felt that touch the other night, stroking him\nto sleep. And could feel it now as she petted the sheepskin. \u201cTwenty silvers\nfor a snowsheep hide? Isn\u2019t that a little low?\u201d\n\u201cMy mom makes me work weekends. It\u2019d piss her off to sell it for\nwhat it\u2019s actually worth.\u201d\n\u201cLoyal of you,\u201d Bryce said, chuckling. She leaned in, her voice\ndropping. \u201cThis is going to sound so random, but I have a question for\nyou.\u201d\nHunt kept back, watching her work. The irreverent, down-to-earth\nparty girl, merely looking to score some new drugs.\nThe shifter barely looked up. \u201cYeah?\u201d\nBryce said, \u201cYou know where I can get anything \u2026 fun around here?\u201d\nThe girl rolled her chestnut-colored eyes. \u201cAll right. Let\u2019s hear it.\u201d\n\u201cHear what?\u201d Bryce asked innocently.\nThe shifter lifted her phone, typing away with rainbow-painted nails.\n\u201cThat fake-ass act you gave everyone else here, and in the two other\nwarehouses.\u201d She held up her phone. \u201cWe\u2019re all on a group chat.\u201d She\ngestured to everyone in the market around them. \u201cI got, like, ten warnings\nyou two would be coming through here, asking cheesy questions about\ndrugs or whatever.\u201d\nIt was, perhaps, the first time Hunt had seen Bryce at a loss for words.\nSo he stepped up to her side. \u201cAll right,\u201d he said to the teenager. \u201cBut do\nyou know anything?\u201d\nThe girl looked him over. \u201cYou think the Vipe would allow shit like\nthat synth in here?\u201d\n\u201cShe allows every other depravity and crime,\u201d Hunt said through his\nteeth.\n\u201cYeah, but she\u2019s not dumb,\u201d the shifter said, tossing her braid over a\nshoulder.\n\u201cSo you\u2019ve heard of it,\u201d Bryce said.\n\u201cThe Vipe told me to tell you that it\u2019s nasty, and she doesn\u2019t deal in it,\nand never will.\u201d\n\u201cBut someone does?\u201d Bryce said tightly.\nThis was bad. This would not end well at all\u2014\n\u201cThe Vipe also told me to say you should check the river.\u201d She went\nback to her phone, presumably to tell the Vipe that she\u2019d conveyed the\nmessage. \u201cThat\u2019s the place for that kinda shit.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Bryce asked.\nA shrug. \u201cAsk the mer.\u201d\n\u201cWe should lay out the facts,\u201d Hunt said as Bryce stormed for the Meat\nMarket\u2019s docks. \u201cBefore we run to the mer, accusing them of being drug\ndealers.\u201d\n\u201cToo late,\u201d Bryce said.\nHe hadn\u2019t been able to stop her from sending a message via otter to\nTharion twenty minutes ago, and sure as Hel hadn\u2019t been able to stop her\nfrom heading for the river\u2019s edge to wait.\nHunt gripped her arm, the dock mere steps away. \u201cBryce, the mer do\nnot take kindly to being falsely accused\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWho said it\u2019s false?\u201d\n\u201cTharion isn\u2019t a drug dealer, and he sure as shit isn\u2019t selling something\nas bad as synth seems to be.\u201d\n\u201cHe might know someone who is.\u201d She shrugged out of his grasp.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been dicking around for long enough. I want answers. Now.\u201d She\nnarrowed her eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to get this over with? So you can have\nyour sentence reduced?\u201d\nHe did, but he said, \u201cThe synth probably has nothing to do with this.\nWe shouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d\nBut she\u2019d already reached the wood slats of the dock, not daring to\nlook into the eddying water beneath. The Meat Market\u2019s docks were\nnotorious dumping grounds. And feeding troughs for aquatic scavengers.\nWater splashed, and then a powerful male body was sitting on the end\nof the dock. \u201cThis part of the river is gross,\u201d Tharion said by way of\ngreeting.\nBryce didn\u2019t smile. Didn\u2019t say anything other than, \u201cWho\u2019s selling\nsynth in the river?\u201d\nThe grin vanished from Tharion\u2019s face. Hunt began to object, but the\nmer said, \u201cNot in, Legs.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cOn the river.\u201d\n\u201cSo it\u2019s true, then. It\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s what? A healing drug that leaked from a\nlab? Who\u2019s behind it?\u201d\nHunt stepped up to her side. \u201cTharion\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDanika Fendyr,\u201d Tharion said, his eyes soft. Like he knew who\nDanika had been to her. \u201cThe intel came in a day before her death. She was\nspotted doing a deal on a boat just past here.\u201d"}, "59": {"Name": "PART III THE CANYON-Chapter 59", "Page Content": " 9 \n\u201cWhat do you mean, Danika was selling it?\u201d\nTharion shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know if she was selling it or buying it\nor what, but right before synth started appearing on the streets, she was\nspotted on an Auxiliary boat in the dead of night. There was a crate of synth\non board.\u201d\nHunt murmured, \u201cIt always comes back to Danika.\u201d\nAbove the roaring in her head, Bryce said, \u201cMaybe she was\nconfiscating it.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Tharion admitted, then ran a hand through his auburn hair.\n\u201cBut that synth\u2014it\u2019s some bad shit, Bryce. If Danika was involved in it\u2014\u201d\n\u201cShe wasn\u2019t. She never would have done something like that.\u201d Her\nheart was racing so fast she thought she\u2019d puke. She turned to Hunt. \u201cBut it\nexplains why there were traces of it on her clothes, if she had to confiscate\nit for the Aux.\u201d\nHunt\u2019s face was grim. \u201cMaybe.\u201d\nShe crossed her arms. \u201cWhat is it, exactly?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s synthetic magic,\u201d Tharion said, eyes darting between them. \u201cIt\nstarted off as an aid for healing, but someone apparently realized that in\nsuper-concentrated doses, it can give humans strength greater than most\nVanir. For short bursts, but it\u2019s potent. They\u2019ve tried to make it for\ncenturies, but it seemed impossible. Most people thought it was akin to\nalchemy\u2014just as unlikely as turning something into gold. But apparently\nmodern science made it work this time.\u201d He angled his head. \u201cDoes this\nhave to do with the demon you were hunting?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a possibility,\u201d Hunt said.\n\u201cI\u2019ll let you know if I get any other reports,\u201d Tharion said, and didn\u2019t\nwait for a farewell before diving back into the water.\nBryce stared out at the river in the midday sun, gripping the white opal\nin her pocket.\n\u201cI know it wasn\u2019t what you wanted to hear,\u201d Hunt said cautiously\nbeside her.\n\u201cWas she killed by whoever is creating the synth? If she was on that\nboat to seize their shipment?\u201d She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear.\n\u201cCould the person selling the synth and the person searching for the Horn\nbe the same, if the synth can possibly repair the Horn?\u201d\nHe rubbed his chin. \u201cI guess. But this could also be a dead end.\u201d\nShe sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t get why she never mentioned it.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe it wasn\u2019t worth mentioning,\u201d he suggested.\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d she murmured. \u201cMaybe.\u201d\nBryce waited until Hunt hit the gym in her apartment building before she\ndialed Fury.\nShe didn\u2019t know why she bothered. Fury hadn\u2019t taken a call from her\nin months.\nThe call nearly went to audiomail before she answered. \u201cHey.\u201d\nBryce slumped against her bed and blurted, \u201cI\u2019m shocked you picked\nup.\u201d\n\u201cYou caught me between jobs.\u201d\nOr maybe Juniper had bitten Fury\u2019s head off about bailing.\nBryce said, \u201cI thought you were coming back to hunt down whoever\nwas behind the Raven\u2019s bombing.\u201d\n\u201cI thought so, too, but it turned out I didn\u2019t need to cross the Haldren\nto do it.\u201d\nBryce leaned against her headboard, stretching out her legs. \u201cSo it\nreally was the human rebellion behind it?\u201d Maybe that C on the crates Ruhn\nthought was the Horn was just that: a letter.\n\u201cYeah. Specifics and names are classified, though.\u201d\nFury had said that to her so many times in the past that she\u2019d lost\ncount. \u201cAt least tell me if you found them?\u201d\nThere was a good chance that Fury was sharpening her arsenal of\nweapons on the desk of whatever fancy hotel she was holed up in right now.\n\u201cI said I was between jobs, didn\u2019t I?\u201d\n\u201cCongratulations?\u201d\nA soft laugh that still freaked Bryce the fuck out. \u201cSure.\u201d Fury paused.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up, B.\u201d\nAs if that somehow erased two years of near-silence. \u201cDid Danika ever\nmention synth to you?\u201d\nBryce could have sworn something heavy and metallic clunked in the\nbackground. Fury said softly, \u201cWho told you about synth?\u201d\nBryce straightened. \u201cI think it\u2019s getting spread around here. I met a\nmer today who said Danika was seen on an Aux boat with a crate of it, right\nbefore she died.\u201d She blew out a breath.\n\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous, Bryce. Really dangerous. Don\u2019t fuck around with it.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d Gods. \u201cI haven\u2019t touched any drugs in two years.\u201d Then she\nadded, unable to stop herself, \u201cIf you\u2019d bothered to take my calls or visit,\nyou would have known that.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been busy.\u201d\nLiar. Fucking liar and coward. Bryce ground out, \u201cLook, I wanted to\nknow if Danika had ever mentioned synth to you before she died, because\nshe didn\u2019t mention it to me.\u201d\nAnother one of those pauses.\n\u201cShe did, didn\u2019t she.\u201d Even now, Bryce wasn\u2019t sure why jealousy\nseared her chest.\n\u201cShe might have said that there was some nasty shit being sold,\u201d Fury\nsaid.\n\u201cYou never thought to mention it to anyone?\u201d\n\u201cI did. To you. At the White Raven the night Danika died. Someone\ntried to sell it to you then, for fuck\u2019s sake. I told you to stay the Hel away\nfrom it.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you still didn\u2019t find the chance to mention then or after Danika\ndied that she warned you about it in the first place?\u201d\n\u201cA demon ripped her to shreds, Bryce. Drug busts didn\u2019t seem\nconnected to it.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what if it was?\u201d\n\u201cHow?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, I just \u2026\u201d Bryce tapped her foot on the bed. \u201cWhy\nwouldn\u2019t she have told me?\u201d\n\u201cBecause \u2026\u201d Fury stopped herself.\n\u201cBecause what?\u201d Bryce snapped.\n\u201cAll right,\u201d Fury said, her voice sharpening. \u201cDanika didn\u2019t want to\ntell you because she didn\u2019t want you getting near it. Even thinking about\ntrying synth.\u201d\nBryce shot to her feet. \u201cWhy the fuck would I ever\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBecause we have literally seen you take everything.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been right there, taking everything with me, you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSynth is synthetic magic, Bryce. To replace real magic. Of which you\nhave none. It gives humans Vanir powers and strength for like an hour. And\nthen it can seriously fuck you up. Make you addicted and worse. For the\nVanir, it\u2019s even riskier\u2014a crazy high and superstrength, but it can easily\nturn bad. Danika didn\u2019t want you even knowing something like that\nexisted.\u201d\n\u201cAs if I\u2019m so desperate to be like you big, tough Vanir that I\u2019d take\nsomething\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHer goal was to protect you. Always. Even from yourself.\u201d\nThe words struck like a slap to the face. Bryce\u2019s throat closed up.\nFury blew out a breath. \u201cLook, I know that came out harsh. But take\nmy word for it: don\u2019t mess with synth. If they\u2019ve actually managed to mass-\nproduce the stuff outside of an official lab and make it in even stronger\nconcentrations, then it\u2019s bad news. Stay away from it, and anyone who deals\nin it.\u201d\nBryce\u2019s hands shook, but she managed to say \u201cAll right\u201d without\nsounding like she was one breath away from crying.\n\u201cLook, I gotta go,\u201d Fury said. \u201cI\u2019ve got something to do tonight. But\nI\u2019ll be back in Lunathion in a few days. I\u2019m wanted at the Summit in two\nweeks\u2014it\u2019s at some compound a few hours outside the city.\u201d\nBryce didn\u2019t ask why Fury Axtar would attend a Summit of various\nValbaran leaders. She didn\u2019t really care that Fury would be coming back at\nall.\n\u201cMaybe we can grab a meal,\u201d Fury said.\n\u201cSure.\u201d\n\u201cBryce.\u201d Her name was both a reprimand and an apology. Fury sighed.\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you.\u201d\nHer throat burned, but she hung up. Took a few long breaths. Fury\ncould go to Hel.\nBryce waited to call her brother until she\u2019d plunked her ass down on\nthe couch, opened her laptop, and pulled up the search engine. He answered\non the second ring. \u201cYeah?\u201d\n\u201cI want you to spare me the lectures and the warnings and all that shit,\nokay?\u201d\nRuhn paused. \u201cOkay.\u201d\nShe put the call on speaker and leaned her forearms on her knees, the\ncursor hanging over the search bar.\nRuhn asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on with you and Athalar?\u201d\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Bryce said, rubbing her eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s not my type.\u201d\n\u201cI was asking about why he\u2019s not on the call, not whether you\u2019re\ndating, but that\u2019s good to know.\u201d\nShe gritted her teeth and typed synthetic magic in the search bar. As\nthe results filtered in, she said, \u201cAthalar is off making those muscles of his\neven nicer.\u201d Ruhn huffed a laugh.\nShe skimmed the results: small, short articles about the uses of a\nsynthetic healing magic to aid in human healing. \u201cThat medwitch who sent\nyou the information about synthetic magic\u2014did she offer any thoughts on\nwhy or how it got onto the streets?\u201d\n\u201cNo. I think she\u2019s more concerned about its origins\u2014and an antidote.\nShe told me she actually tested some of the kristallos venom she got out of\nAthalar from the other night against the synth, trying to formulate one. She\nthinks her healing magic can act like some kind of stabilizer for the venom\nto make the antidote, but she needs more of the venom to keep testing it out.\nI don\u2019t know. It sounded like some complex shit.\u201d He added wryly, \u201cIf you\nrun into a kristallos, ask it for some venom, would you?\u201d\n\u201cGot a crush, Ruhn?\u201d\nHe snorted. \u201cShe\u2019s done us a huge favor. I\u2019d like to repay her in\nwhatever way we can.\u201d\n\u201cAll right.\u201d She clicked through more results, including a patent filing\nfrom Redner Industries for the drug, dating back ten years. Way before\nDanika\u2019s time working there.\n\u201cThe research papers say only tiny amounts are released, even for the\nmedwitches and their healing. It\u2019s incredibly expensive and difficult to\nmake.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if \u2026 what if the formula and a shipment leaked two years ago\nfrom Redner, and Danika was sent out to track it down. And maybe she\nrealized whoever wanted to steal the synth planned to use it to repair the\nHorn, and she stole the Horn before they could. And then they killed her for\nit.\u201d\n\u201cBut why keep it a secret?\u201d Ruhn asked. \u201cWhy not bust the person\nbehind it?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s just a theory.\u201d Better than nothing.\nRuhn went quiet again. She had the feeling a Serious Talk was coming\nand braced herself. \u201cI think it\u2019s admirable, Bryce. That you still care enough\nabout Danika and the Pack of Devils to keep looking into this.\u201d\n\u201cI was ordered to by my boss and the Governor, remember?\u201d\n\u201cYou would have looked once you heard it wasn\u2019t Briggs anyway.\u201d He\nsighed. \u201cYou know, Danika nearly beat the shit out of me once.\u201d\n\u201cNo she didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cOh, she did. We ran into each other in Redner Tower\u2019s lobby when I\nwent to meet up with Declan after some fancy meeting he was having with\ntheir top people. Wait\u2014you dated that prick son of Redner\u2019s, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cI did,\u201d she said tightly.\n\u201cGross. Just gross, Bryce.\u201d\n\u201cTell me about Danika wiping the floor with your pathetic ass.\u201d\nShe could nearly hear his smile through the phone. \u201cI don\u2019t know how\nwe got into it about you, but we did.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019d you say?\u201d\n\u201cWhy are you assuming I did the instigating? Did you ever meet\nDanika? She had a mouth on her like I\u2019ve never seen.\u201d He clicked his\ntongue, the admiration in the noise making Bryce\u2019s chest clench. \u201cAnyway,\nI told her to tell you that I was sorry. She told me to go fuck myself, and\nfuck my apology.\u201d\nBryce blinked. \u201cShe never told me she ran into you.\u201d\n\u201cRan into is an understatement.\u201d He whistled. \u201cShe hadn\u2019t even made\nthe Drop, and she nearly kicked my balls across the lobby. Declan had to \u2026\ninvolve himself to stop it.\u201d\nIt sounded like Danika all right. Even if everything else she\u2019d learned\nlately didn\u2019t."}, "60": {"Name": "PART III THE CANYON-Chapter 60", "Page Content": " 0 \n\u201cIt\u2019s a stretch,\u201d Hunt said an hour later from his spot beside her on the\nsectional. She\u2019d filled him in on her latest theory, his brows rising with each\nword out of her mouth.\nBryce clicked through the pages on Redner Industries\u2019 website.\n\u201cDanika worked part-time at Redner. She rarely talked about the shit she\ndid for them. Some kind of security division.\u201d She pulled up the login page.\n\u201cMaybe her old work account still has info on her assignments.\u201d\nHer fingers shook only slightly as she typed in Danika\u2019s username,\nhaving seen it so many times on her phone in the past: dfendyr.\nDFendyr\u2014Defender. She\u2019d never realized it until now. Fury\u2019s harsh\nwords rang through her head. Bryce ignored them.\nShe typed in one of Danika\u2019s usual half-assed passwords: 1234567.\nNothing.\n\u201cAgain,\u201d Hunt said warily, \u201cit\u2019s a stretch.\u201d He leaned back against the\ncushions. \u201cWe\u2019re better off doubling down with Danaan on looking for the\nHorn, not chasing down this drug.\u201d\nBryce countered, \u201cDanika was involved in this synth stuff and never\nsaid a word. You don\u2019t think that\u2019s weird? You don\u2019t think there might be\nsomething more here?\u201d\n\u201cShe also didn\u2019t tell you the truth about Philip Briggs,\u201d Hunt said\ncarefully. \u201cOr that she stole the Horn. Keeping things from you could have\nbeen standard for her.\u201d\nBryce just typed in another password. Then another. And another.\n\u201cWe need the full picture, Hunt,\u201d she said, trying again. She needed the\nfull picture. \u201cIt all ties together somehow.\u201d\nBut every password failed. Every one of Danika\u2019s usual combinations.\nBryce shut her eyes, foot bouncing on the carpet as she recited, \u201cThe\nHorn could possibly be healed by the synth in a large enough dose.\nSynthetic magic has obsidian salt as one of its ingredients. The kristallos\ncan be summoned by obsidian salt \u2026\u201d Hunt remained silent as she thought\nit through. \u201cThe kristallos was bred to track the Horn. The kristallos\u2019s\nvenom can eat away at magic. The medwitch wants some venom to test if\nit\u2019s possible to create an antidote to synth with her magic or something.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nHer eyes opened. \u201cRuhn told me.\u201d She filled him in on Ruhn\u2019s half-\njoking request for more venom to give the medwitch.\nHunt\u2019s eyes darkened. \u201cInteresting. If the synth is on the verge of\nbecoming a deadly street drug \u2026 we should help her get the venom.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about the Horn?\u201d\nHis jaw tightened. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep looking. But if this drug explodes\u2014not\njust in this city but across the territory, the world \u2026 that antidote is vital.\u201d\nHe scanned her face. \u201cHow can we get our hands on some venom for her?\u201d\nBryce breathed, \u201cIf we summon a kristallos\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t take that risk,\u201d Hunt snarled. \u201cWe\u2019ll figure out how to get\nthe venom another way.\u201d\n\u201cI can handle myself\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t fucking handle myself, Quinlan. Not if you might be in\ndanger.\u201d\nHis words rippled between them. Emotion glinted in his eyes, if she\ndared to read what was there.\nBut Hunt\u2019s phone buzzed, and he lifted his hips off the couch to pull it\nfrom the back pocket of his pants. He glanced at the screen, and his wings\nshifted, tucking in slightly.\n\u201cMicah?\u201d she dared ask.\n\u201cJust some legion shit,\u201d he murmured, and stood. \u201cI gotta head out for\na few. Naomi will take watch.\u201d He gestured to the computer. \u201cKeep trying if\nyou want, but let\u2019s think, Bryce, before we do anything drastic to get our\nhands on that venom.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d\nIt was apparently acceptance enough for Hunt to leave, but not before\nruffling her hair and leaning down to whisper, his lips brushing the curve of\nher ear, \u201cJJ would be proud of you.\u201d Her toes curled in her slippers, and\nstayed that way long after he\u2019d left.\nAfter trying another few password options, Bryce sighed and shut the\ncomputer. They were narrowing in on it\u2014the truth. She could feel it.\nBut would she be ready for it?\nHer cycle arrived the next morning like a gods-damned train barreling into\nher body, which Bryce decided was fitting, given what day it was.\nShe stepped into the great room to find Hunt making breakfast, his hair\nstill mussed with sleep. He stiffened at her approach, though. Then he\nturned, his eyes darting over her. His preternatural sense of smell missed\nnothing. \u201cYou\u2019re bleeding.\u201d\n\u201cEvery three months, like clockwork.\u201d Pure-blooded Fae rarely had a\ncycle at all; humans had it monthly\u2014she\u2019d somehow settled somewhere in\nbetween.\nShe slid onto a stool at the kitchen counter. A glance at her phone\nshowed no messages from Juniper or Fury. Not even a message from her\nmom biting her head off about bailing on the medwitch appointment.\n\u201cYou need anything?\u201d Hunt extended a plate of eggs and bacon toward\nher. Then a cup of coffee.\n\u201cI took something for the cramps.\u201d She sipped her coffee. \u201cBut\nthanks.\u201d\nHe grunted, going back to plating his own breakfast. He stood on the\nother side of the counter and wolfed down a few bites before he said,\n\u201cBeyond the synth stuff and the antidote, I think the Horn ties everything\ntogether. We should concentrate on looking for it. There hasn\u2019t been a\nmurder since the temple guard, but I doubt the person has dropped the\nsearch for it since they\u2019ve already gone to such trouble. If we get our hands\non the Horn, I still feel like the killer will save us the trouble of looking for\nthem and come right to us.\u201d\n\u201cOr maybe they found wherever Danika hid it already.\u201d She took\nanother bite. \u201cMaybe they\u2019re just waiting until the Summit or something.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe. If that\u2019s the case, then we need to figure out who has it.\nImmediately.\u201d\n\u201cBut even Ruhn can\u2019t find it. Danika didn\u2019t leave any hint of where\nshe hid it. None of her last known locations were likely hiding spots.\u201d\n\u201cSo maybe today we go back to square one. Look at everything we\u2019ve\nlearned and\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t today.\u201d She finished off her breakfast and brought the plate\nover to the sink. \u201cI\u2019ve got some meetings.\u201d\n\u201cReschedule them.\u201d\n\u201cJesiba needs them held today.\u201d\nHe looked at her for a long moment, as if he could see through\neverything she\u2019d said, but finally nodded.\nShe ignored the disappointment and concern in his face, his tone, as he\nsaid, \u201cAll right.\u201d\nLehabah sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re being mean today, BB. And don\u2019t blame it on your\ncycle.\u201d\nSeated at the table in the heart of the gallery\u2019s library, Bryce massaged\nher brows with her thumb and forefinger. \u201cSorry.\u201d\nHer phone lay dark and quiet on the table beside her.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t invite Athie down here for lunch.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t need the distraction.\u201d The lie was smooth. Hunt hadn\u2019t called\nher on the other lie, either\u2014that Jesiba was watching the gallery cameras\ntoday, so he should stay on the roof.\nBut despite needing him, needing everyone, at arm\u2019s length today, and\ndespite claiming she couldn\u2019t look for the Horn, she\u2019d been combing over\nvarious texts regarding it for hours now. There was nothing in them but the\nsame information, over and over.\nA faint scratching sound stretched across the entire length of the\nlibrary. Bryce pulled over Lehabah\u2019s tablet and cranked up the volume on\nthe speakers, blasting music through the space.\nA loud, angry thump sounded. From the corner of her eye, she watched\nthe n\u00f8kk swim off, its translucent tail slashing through the dim water.\nPop music: Who would have thought it was such a strong deterrent for\nthe creature?\n\u201cHe wants to kill me,\u201d Lehabah whispered. \u201cI can tell.\u201d\n\u201cI doubt you\u2019d make a very satisfying snack,\u201d Bryce said. \u201cNot even a\nmouthful.\u201d\n\u201cHe knows that if I\u2019m submerged in water, I\u2019m dead in a heartbeat.\u201d\nIt was another form of torture for the sprite, Bryce had realized early\non. A way for Jesiba to keep Lehabah in line down here, caged within a\ncage, as surely as all the other animals throughout the space. No better way\nto intimidate a fire sprite than to have a hundred-thousand-gallon tank\nlooming.\n\u201cHe wants to kill you, too,\u201d Lehabah whispered. \u201cYou ignore him, and\nhe hates that. I can see the rage and hunger in his eyes when he looks at\nyou, BB. Be careful when you feed him.\u201d\n\u201cI am.\u201d The feeding hatch was too small for it to fit through anyway.\nAnd since the n\u00f8kk wouldn\u2019t dare bring its head above the water for fear of\nthe air, only its arms were a threat if the hatch was opened and the feeding\nplatform was lowered into the water. But it kept to the bottom of the tank,\nhiding among the rocks whenever she dumped in the steaks, letting them\ndrift lazily down.\nIt wanted to hunt. Wanted something big, juicy, and frightened.\nBryce glanced toward the dim tank, illuminated by three built-in\nspotlights. \u201cJesiba will get bored with him soon and gift him to a client,\u201d\nshe lied to Lehabah.\n\u201cWhy does she collect us at all?\u201d the sprite whispered. \u201cAm I not a\nperson, too?\u201d She pointed to the tattoo on her wrist. \u201cWhy do they insist on\nthis?\u201d\n\u201cBecause we live in a republic that has decided that threats to its order\nhave to be punished\u2014and punished so thoroughly that it makes others\nhesitate to rebel, too.\u201d Her words were flat. Cold.\n\u201cHave you ever thought of what it might be like\u2014without the Asteri?\u201d\nBryce shot her a look. \u201cBe quiet, Lehabah.\u201d\n\u201cBut BB\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBe quiet, Lehabah.\u201d There were cameras everywhere in this library,\nall with audio. They were exclusive to Jesiba, yes, but to speak of it here \u2026\nLehabah drifted to her little couch. \u201cAthie would talk to me about it.\u201d\n\u201cAthie is a slave with little left to lose.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t say such things, BB,\u201d Lehabah hissed. \u201cThere is always\nsomething left to lose.\u201d\nBryce was in a foul spirit. Maybe there was something going on with Ruhn\nor Juniper. Hunt had seen her checking her phone frequently this morning,\nas if waiting for a call or message. None had come. At least, as far as he\ncould tell on the walk to the gallery. And, judging by the distant, sharp look\nstill on her face as she left just before sunset, none had come in during the\nday, either.\nBut she didn\u2019t head home. She went to a bakery.\nHunt kept to the rooftops nearby, watching while she walked into the\naqua-painted interior and walked out three minutes later with a white box in\nher hands.\nThen she turned her steps toward the river, dodging workers and\ntourists and shoppers all enjoying the end of the day. If she was aware that\nhe followed, she didn\u2019t seem to care. Didn\u2019t even look up once as she aimed\nfor a wooden bench along the river walkway.\nThe setting sun gilded the mists veiling the Bone Quarter. A few feet\ndown the paved walkway, the dark arches of the Black Dock loomed. No\nmourning families stood beneath them today, waiting for the onyx boat to\ntake their coffin.\nBryce sat on the bench overlooking the river and the Sleeping City, the\nwhite bakery box beside her, and checked her phone again.\nSick of waiting until she deigned to talk to him about whatever was\neating her up, Hunt landed quietly before sliding onto the bench\u2019s wooden\nplanks, the box between them. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d\nBryce stared out at the river. She looked drained. Like that first night\nhe\u2019d seen her, in the legion\u2019s holding center.\nShe still wasn\u2019t looking at him when she said, \u201cDanika would have\nbeen twenty-five today.\u201d\nHunt went still. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2026 Today\u2019s Danika\u2019s birthday.\u201d\nShe glanced to her phone, discarded at her side. \u201cNo one remembered.\nNot Juniper or Fury\u2014not even my mom. Last year, they remembered, but\n\u2026 I guess it was a onetime thing.\u201d\n\u201cYou could have asked them.\u201d\n\u201cI know they\u2019re busy. And \u2026\u201d She ran a hand through her hair.\n\u201cHonestly, I thought they\u2019d remember. I wanted them to remember. Even\njust a message saying something bullshitty, like I miss her or whatever.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s in the box?\u201d\n\u201cChocolate croissants,\u201d she said hoarsely. \u201cDanika always wanted\nthem on her birthday. They were her favorite.\u201d\nHunt looked from the box to her, then to the looming Bone Quarter\nacross the river. How many croissants had he seen her eating these weeks?\nPerhaps in part because they connected her to Danika the same way that\nscar on her thigh did. When he looked back at her, her mouth was a tight,\ntrembling line.\n\u201cIt sucks,\u201d she said, her voice thick. \u201cIt sucks that everyone just \u2026\nmoves on, and forgets. They expect me to forget. But I can\u2019t.\u201d She rubbed at\nher chest. \u201cI can\u2019t forget. And maybe it\u2019s fucking weird that I bought my\ndead friend a bunch of birthday croissants. But the world moved on. Like\nshe never existed.\u201d\nHe watched her for a long moment. Then he said, \u201cShahar was that for\nme. I\u2019d never met anyone like her. I think I loved her from the moment I\nlaid eyes on her in her palace, even though she was so high above me that\nshe might as well have been the moon. But she saw me too. And somehow,\nshe picked me. Out of all of them, she picked me.\u201d He shook his head, the\nwords creaking from him as they crept from that box he\u2019d locked them in\nall this while. \u201cI would have done anything for her. I did anything for her.\nAnything she asked. And when it all went to Hel, when they told me it was\nover, I refused to believe it. How could she be gone? It was like saying the\nsun was gone. It just \u2026 there was nothing left if she wasn\u2019t there.\u201d He ran a\nhand through his hair. \u201cThis won\u2019t be a consolation, but it took me about\nfifty years before I really believed it. That it was over. Yet even now \u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou still love her that much?\u201d\nHe held her gaze, unflinching. \u201cAfter my mother died, I basically fell\ninto my grief. But Shahar\u2014she brought me out of that. Made me feel alive\nfor the first time. Aware of myself, of my potential. I\u2019ll always love her, if\nonly for that.\u201d\nShe looked to the river. \u201cI never realized it,\u201d she murmured. \u201cThat you\nand I are mirrors.\u201d\nHe hadn\u2019t, either. But a voice floated back to him. You look how I feel\nevery day, she\u2019d whispered when she\u2019d cleaned him up after Micah\u2019s latest\nassignment. \u201cIs it a bad thing?\u201d\nA half smile tugged at a corner of her mouth. \u201cNo. No, it isn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cNo issue with the Umbra Mortis being your emotional twin?\u201d\nBut her face grew serious again. \u201cThat\u2019s what they call you, but that\u2019s\nnot who you are.\u201d\n\u201cAnd who am I?\u201d\n\u201cA pain in my ass.\u201d Her smile was brighter than the setting sun on the\nriver. He laughed, but she added, \u201cYou\u2019re my friend. Who watches trashy\nTV with me and puts up with my shit. You\u2019re the person I don\u2019t need to\nexplain myself to\u2014not when it matters. You see everything I am, and you\ndon\u2019t run away from it.\u201d\nHe smiled at her, let it convey everything that glowed inside him at her\nwords. \u201cI like that.\u201d\nColor stained her cheeks, but she blew out a breath as she turned\ntoward the box. \u201cWell, Danika,\u201d she said. \u201cHappy birthday.\u201d\nShe peeled off the tape and flipped back the top.\nHer smile vanished. She shut the lid before Hunt could see what was\ninside.\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\nShe shook her head, making to grab the box\u2014but Hunt grabbed it first,\npulling it onto his lap and opening the lid.\nInside lay half a dozen croissants, carefully arranged in a pile. And on\nthe top one, artfully written in a chocolate drizzle, was one word: Trash.\nIt wasn\u2019t the hateful word that tore through him. No, it was the way\nBryce\u2019s hands shook, the way her face turned red, and her mouth became a\nthin line.\n\u201cJust throw it out,\u201d she whispered.\nNo hint of the loyal defiance and anger. Just exhausted, humiliated\npain.\nHis head went quiet. Terribly, terribly quiet.\n\u201cJust throw it out, Hunt,\u201d she whispered again. Tears shone in her eyes.\nSo Hunt took the box. And he stood.\nHe had a good idea of who had done it. Who\u2019d had the message\naltered. Who had shouted that same word\u2014trash\u2014at Bryce the other week,\nwhen they\u2019d left the Den.\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Bryce pleaded. But Hunt was already airborne.\nAmelie Ravenscroft was laughing with her friends, swigging from a beer,\nwhen Hunt exploded into the Moonwood bar. People screamed and fell\nback, magic flaring.\nBut Hunt only saw her. Saw her claws form as she smirked at him. He\nset the pastry box on the wooden bar with careful precision.\nA phone call to the Aux had given him the info he needed about the\nshifter\u2019s whereabouts. And Amelie seemed to have been waiting for him, or\nat least Bryce, when she leaned back against the bar and sneered, \u201cWell,\nisn\u2019t this\u2014\u201d\nHunt pinned her against the wall by the throat.\nThe growls and attempted attacks of her pack against the wall of\nrippling lightning he threw up were background noise. Fear gleamed in\nAmelie\u2019s wide, shocked eyes as Hunt snarled in her face.\nBut he said softly, \u201cYou don\u2019t speak to her, you don\u2019t go near her, you\ndon\u2019t even fucking think about her again.\u201d He sent enough of his lightning\nthrough his touch that he knew pain lashed through her body. Amelie\nchoked. \u201cDo you understand me?\u201d\nPeople were on their phones, dialing for the 33rd Legion or the\nAuxiliary.\nAmelie scratched at his wrists, her boots kicking at his shins. He only\ntightened his grip. Lightning wrapped around her throat. \u201cDo you\nunderstand?\u201d His voice was frozen. Utterly calm. The voice of the Umbra\nMortis.\nA male approached his periphery. Ithan Holstrom.\nBut Ithan\u2019s eyes were on Amelie as he breathed, \u201cWhat did you do,\nAmelie?\u201d\nHunt only said, snarling again in Amelie\u2019s face, \u201cDon\u2019t play dumb,\nHolstrom.\u201d\nIthan noticed the pastry box on the bar then. Amelie thrashed, but Hunt\nheld her still as her Second opened the lid and looked inside. Ithan asked\nsoftly, \u201cWhat is this?\u201d\n\u201cAsk your Alpha,\u201d Hunt ground out.\nIthan went utterly still. But whatever he was thinking wasn\u2019t Hunt\u2019s\nconcern, not as he met Amelie\u2019s burning stare again. Hunt said, \u201cYou leave\nher the fuck alone. Forever. Got it?\u201d\nAmelie looked like she\u2019d spit on him, but he sent another casual zap of\npower into her, flaying her from the inside out. She winced, hissing and\ngagging. But nodded.\nHunt immediately released her, but his power kept her pinned against\nthe wall. He surveyed her, then her pack. Then Ithan, whose face had gone\nfrom horror to something near grief as he must have realized what day it\nwas and pieced enough of it together\u2014thought about who had always\nwanted chocolate croissants on this day, at least.\nHunt said, \u201cYou\u2019re all pathetic.\u201d\nAnd then he walked out. Took a damn while flying home.\nBryce was waiting for him on the roof. A phone in her hand. \u201cNo,\u201d she\nwas saying to someone on the line. \u201cNo, he\u2019s back.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d he heard Isaiah say, and it sounded like the male was about to\nadd something else when she hung up.\nBryce wrapped her arms around herself. \u201cYou\u2019re a fucking idiot.\u201d\nHunt didn\u2019t deny it.\n\u201cIs Amelie dead?\u201d There was fear\u2014actual fear\u2014in her face.\n\u201cNo.\u201d The word rumbled from him, lightning hissing in its wake.\n\u201cYou \u2026\u201d She rubbed at her face. \u201cI didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me I\u2019m an alphahole, or possessive and aggressive or\nwhatever terms you use.\u201d\nShe lowered her hands, her face stark with dread. \u201cYou\u2019ll get in so\nmuch trouble for this, Hunt. There\u2019s no way you won\u2019t\u2014\u201d\nIt was fear for him. Terror for him.\nHunt crossed the distance between them. Took her hands. \u201cYou\u2019re my\nmirror. You said so yourself.\u201d\nHe was shaking. For some reason, he was shaking as he waited for her\nto respond.\nBryce looked at her hands, gripped in his, as she answered, \u201cYes.\u201d\nThe next morning, Bryce messaged her brother. What\u2019s your medwitch\u2019s\nnumber?\nRuhn sent it immediately, no questions asked.\nBryce called her office a minute later, hands shaking. The fair-voiced\nmedwitch could squeeze her in\u2014immediately. So Bryce didn\u2019t give herself\nthe time to reconsider as she slid on her running shorts and a T-shirt, then\nmessaged Jesiba:\nMedical appointment this morning. Be at the gallery by lunch.\nShe found Hunt making breakfast. His brows rose when she just stared\nat him.\n\u201cI know where we can get kristallos venom for the medwitch\u2019s\nantidote tests,\u201d she said."}, "61": {"Name": "PART III THE CANYON-Chapter 61", "Page Content": " 1 \nThe medwitch\u2019s immaculately clean white clinic was small, not like the\nlarger practices Bryce had visited in the past. And rather than the standard\nblue neon sign that jutted over nearly every other block in this city, the\nbroom-and-bell insignia had been rendered in loving care on a gilded\nwooden sign hanging outside. About the only old-school-looking thing\nabout the place.\nThe door down the hallway behind the counter opened, and the\nmedwitch appeared, her curly dark hair pulled back into a bun that showed\noff her elegant brown face. \u201cYou must be Bryce,\u201d the woman said, her full\nsmile instantly setting Bryce at ease. She glanced to Hunt, giving him a\nshallow nod of recognition. But she made no mention of their encounter in\nthe night garden before she said to Bryce, \u201cYour partner can come back\nwith you if you would like. The treatment room can accommodate his\nwings.\u201d\nHunt looked at Bryce, and she saw the question in his expression: Do\nyou want me with you?\nBryce smiled at the witch. \u201cMy partner would love to come.\u201d\nThe white treatment room, despite the clinic\u2019s small size, contained all the\nlatest technology. A bank of computers sat against one wall, the long\nmechanical arm of a surgical light was set against the other. The third wall\nheld a shelf of various tonics and potions and powders in sleek glass vials,\nand a chrome cabinet on the fourth wall likely possessed the actual surgical\ninstruments.\nA far cry from the wood-paneled shops Hunt had visited in Pangera,\nwhere witches still made their own potions in iron cauldrons that had been\npassed down through the generations.\nThe witch idly patted the white leather examination table in the center\nof the room. Hidden panels gleamed in its plastic sides, extensions for Vanir\nof all shapes and sizes.\nHunt claimed the lone wooden chair by the cabinet as Bryce hopped\nonto the table, her face slightly pale.\n\u201cYou said on the phone that you received this wound from a kristallos\ndemon, and it was never healed\u2014the venom is still in you.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Bryce said quietly. Hunt hated every bit of pain that laced that\nword.\n\u201cAnd you give me permission to use the venom I extract in my\nexperiments as I search for a synth antidote?\u201d\nBryce glanced at him, and he nodded his encouragement. \u201cAn antidote\nto synth seems pretty damn important to have,\u201d she said, \u201cso yes, you have\nmy permission.\u201d\n\u201cGood. Thank you.\u201d The medwitch rifled through a chart, presumably\nthe one Bryce had filled out on the woman\u2019s website, along with the\nmedical records that were tied to her file as a civitas. \u201cI see that the trauma\nto your leg occurred nearly two years ago?\u201d\nBryce fiddled with the hem of her shirt. \u201cYes. It, um\u2014it closed up, but\nstill hurts. When I run or walk too much, it burns, right along my bone.\u201d\nHunt refrained from grunting his annoyance.\nThe witch\u2019s brow creased, and she looked up from the file to glance at\nBryce\u2019s leg. \u201cHow long has the pain been present?\u201d\n\u201cSince the start,\u201d Bryce said, not looking at him.\nThe medwitch glanced at Hunt. \u201cWere you there for this attack as\nwell?\u201d\nBryce opened her mouth to answer, but Hunt said, \u201cYes.\u201d Bryce\nwhipped her head around to look at him. He kept his eyes on the witch. \u201cI\narrived three minutes after it occurred. Her leg was ripped open across the\nthigh, courtesy of the kristallos\u2019s teeth.\u201d The words tumbled out, the\nconfession spilling from his lips. \u201cI used one of the legion\u2019s medical\nstaplers to seal the wound as best I could.\u201d Hunt went on, unsure why his\nheart was thundering, \u201cThe medical note about the injury is from me. She\ndidn\u2019t receive any treatment after that. It\u2019s why the scar \u2026\u201d He swallowed\nagainst the guilt working its way up his throat. \u201cIt\u2019s why it looks the way it\ndoes.\u201d He met Bryce\u2019s eyes, letting her see the apology there. \u201cIt\u2019s my\nfault.\u201d\nBryce stared at him. Not a trace of damnation on her face\u2014just raw\nunderstanding.\nThe witch glanced between them, as if debating whether to give them a\nmoment. But she asked Bryce, \u201cSo you did not see a medwitch after that\nnight?\u201d\nBryce still held Hunt\u2019s gaze as she said to the woman, \u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\nHer eyes still didn\u2019t leave his as she rasped, \u201cBecause I wanted to hurt.\nI wanted it to remind me every day.\u201d Those were tears in her eyes. Tears\nforming, and he didn\u2019t know why.\nThe witch kindly ignored her tears. \u201cVery well. The whys and hows\naren\u2019t as important as what remains in the wound.\u201d She frowned. \u201cI can\ntreat you today, and if you stick around afterward, you\u2019re welcome to watch\nme test your sample. The venom, in order to be an effective antidote, needs\nto be stabilized so it can interact with the synth and reverse its effects. My\nhealing magic can do that, but I need to be present in order to hold that\nstability. I\u2019m trying to find a way for the magic to permanently hold the\nstabilization so it can be sent out into the world and widely used.\u201d\n\u201cSounds like some tricky stuff,\u201d Bryce said, looking away from Hunt\nat last. He felt the absence of her stare as if a warm flame had been\nextinguished.\nThe witch lifted her hands, white light shining at her fingertips then\nfading away, as if giving a quick check of her magic\u2019s readiness. \u201cI was\nraised by tutors versed in our oldest forms of magic. They taught me an\narray of specialized knowledge.\u201d\nBryce let out a breath through her nose. \u201cAll right. Let\u2019s get on with it,\nthen.\u201d\nBut the witch\u2019s face grew grave. \u201cBryce, I have to open the wound. I\ncan numb you so you don\u2019t feel that part, but the venom, if it\u2019s as deep as I\nsuspect \u2026 I cannot use mithridate leeches to extract it.\u201d She gestured to\nHunt. \u201cWith his wound the other night, the poison had not yet taken root.\nWith an injury like yours, deep and old \u2026 The venom is a kind of\norganism. It feeds off you. It won\u2019t want to go easily, especially after so\nlong meshing itself to your body. I shall have to use my own magic to pull it\nfrom your body. And the venom might very well try to convince you to get\nme to stop. Through pain.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to hurt her?\u201d Hunt asked.\nThe witch winced. \u201cBadly enough that the local anesthesia cannot\nhelp. If you like, I can get a surgical center booked and put you under, but it\ncould take a day or two\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWe do it today. Right now,\u201d Bryce said, her eyes meeting Hunt\u2019s\nagain. He could only offer her a solid nod in return.\n\u201cAll right,\u201d the witch said, striding gracefully to the sink to wash her\nhands. \u201cLet\u2019s get started.\u201d\nThe damage was as bad as she\u2019d feared. Worse.\nThe witch was able to scan Bryce\u2019s leg, first with a machine, then with\nher power, the two combining to form an image on the screen against the far\nwall.\n\u201cYou see the dark band along your femur?\u201d The witch pointed to a\njagged line like forked lightning through Bryce\u2019s thigh. \u201cThat\u2019s the venom.\nEvery time you run or walk too long, it creeps into the surrounding area and\nhurts you.\u201d She pointed to a white area above it. \u201cThat\u2019s all scar tissue. I\nneed to cut through it first, but that should be fast. The extraction is what\nmight take a while.\u201d\nBryce tried to hide her trembling as she nodded. She\u2019d already signed\nhalf a dozen waivers.\nHunt sat in the chair, watching.\n\u201cRight,\u201d the witch said, washing her hands again. \u201cChange into a\ngown, and we can begin.\u201d She reached for the metal cabinet near Hunt, and\nBryce removed her shorts. Her shirt.\nHunt looked away, and the witch helped Bryce step into a light cotton\nshift, tying it at the back for her.\n\u201cYour tattoo is lovely,\u201d the medwitch said. \u201cI don\u2019t recognize the\nalphabet, though\u2014what does it say?\u201d\nBryce could still feel every needle prick that had made the scrolling\nlines of text on her back. \u201cThrough love, all is possible. Basically: my best\nfriend and I will never be parted.\u201d\nA hum of approval as the medwitch looked between Bryce and Hunt.\n\u201cYou two have such a powerful bond.\u201d Bryce didn\u2019t bother to correct her\nassumption that the tattoo was about Hunt. The tattoo that Danika had\ndrunkenly insisted they get one night, claiming that putting the vow of\neternal friendship in another language would make it less cheesy.\nHunt turned back to them, and the witch asked him, \u201cDoes the halo\nhurt you?\u201d\n\u201cOnly when it went on.\u201d\n\u201cWhat witch inked it?\u201d\n\u201cSome imperial hag,\u201d Hunt said through his teeth. \u201cOne of the Old\nOnes.\u201d\nThe witch\u2019s face tightened. \u201cIt is a darker aspect of our work\u2014that we\nbind individuals through the halo. It should be halted entirely.\u201d\nHe threw her a half smile that didn\u2019t reach his eyes. \u201cWant to take it\noff for me?\u201d\nThe witch went wholly still, and Bryce\u2019s breath caught in her throat.\n\u201cWhat would you do if I did?\u201d the witch asked softly, her dark eyes\nglimmering with interest\u2014and ancient power. \u201cWould you punish those\nwho have held you captive?\u201d\nBryce opened her mouth to warn them that this was a dangerous\nconversation, but Hunt thankfully said, \u201cI\u2019m not here to talk about my\ntattoo.\u201d\nIt lay in his eyes, though\u2014his answer. The confirmation. Yes, he\u2019d kill\nthe people who\u2019d done this. The witch inclined her head slightly, as if she\nsaw that answer.\nShe turned back to Bryce and patted the examination table. \u201cVery well.\nLie on your back, Miss Quinlan.\u201d\nBryce began shaking as she obeyed. As the witch strapped down her\nupper body, then her legs, and adjusted the arm of the surgical light. A cart\nrattled as the witch hauled over a tray of various gleaming silver\ninstruments, cotton pads, and an empty glass vial.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to numb you first,\u201d the witch said, and then a needle was in\nher gloved hands.\nBryce shook harder.\n\u201cDeep breaths,\u201d the witch said, tapping the air bubbles from the\nneedle.\nA chair scraped, and then a warm, calloused hand wrapped around\nBryce\u2019s.\nHunt\u2019s eyes locked on hers. \u201cDeep breath, Bryce.\u201d\nShe sucked one in. The needle sank into her thigh, its prick drawing\ntears. She squeezed Hunt\u2019s hand hard enough to feel bones grinding. He\ndidn\u2019t so much as flinch.\nThe pain swiftly faded, numbness tingling over her leg. Deep inside it.\n\u201cDo you feel this?\u201d the witch asked.\n\u201cFeel what?\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d the witch declared. \u201cI\u2019m starting now. I can put up a little\ncurtain if you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Bryce gritted out. \u201cJust do it.\u201d\nNo delays. No waiting.\nShe saw the witch lift the scalpel, and then a slight, firm pressure\npushed against her leg. Bryce shook again, blasting a breath through her\nclenched teeth.\n\u201cSteady now,\u201d the witch said. \u201cI\u2019m cutting through the scar tissue.\u201d\nHunt\u2019s dark eyes held hers, and she forced herself to think of him\ninstead of her leg. He had been there that night. In the alley.\nThe memory surfaced, the fog of pain and terror and grief clearing\nslightly. Strong, warm hands gripping her. Just as he held her hand now. A\nvoice speaking to her. Then utter stillness, as if his voice had been a bell.\nAnd then those strong, warm hands on her thigh, holding her as she sobbed\nand screamed.\nI\u2019ve got you, he\u2019d said over and over. I\u2019ve got you.\n\u201cI believe I can remove most of this scar tissue,\u201d the witch observed.\n\u201cBut \u2026\u201d She swore softly. \u201cLuna above, look at this.\u201d\nBryce refused to look, but Hunt\u2019s eyes slid to the screen behind her,\nwhere her bloody wound was on display. A muscle ticked in his jaw. It said\nenough about what was inside the wound.\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand how you\u2019re walking,\u201d the witch murmured. \u201cYou\nsaid you weren\u2019t taking painkillers to manage it?\u201d\n\u201cOnly during flare-ups,\u201d Bryce whispered.\n\u201cBryce \u2026\u201d The witch hesitated. \u201cI\u2019m going to need you to hold very\nstill. And to breathe as deeply as you can.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Her voice sounded small.\nHunt\u2019s hand clasped hers. Bryce took a steadying breath\u2014\nSomeone poured acid into her leg, and her skin was sizzling, bones\nmelting away\u2014\nIn and out, out and in, her breath sliced through her teeth. Oh gods, oh\ngods\u2014\nHunt interlaced their fingers, squeezing.\nIt burned and burned and burned and burned\u2014\n\u201cWhen I got to the alley that night,\u201d he said above the rush of her\nfrantic breathing, \u201cyou were bleeding everywhere. Yet you tried to protect\nhim first. You wouldn\u2019t let us get near until we showed you our badges and\nproved we were from the legion.\u201d\nShe whimpered, her breathing unable to outrun the razor-sharp\ndigging, digging, digging\u2014\nHunt\u2019s fingers stroked over her brow. \u201cI thought to myself, There\u2019s\nsomeone I want guarding my back. There\u2019s a friend I\u2019d like to have. I think I\ngave you such a hard time when we met up again because \u2026 because some\npart of me knew that, and was afraid of what it\u2019d mean.\u201d\nShe couldn\u2019t stop the tears sliding down her face.\nHis eyes didn\u2019t waver from hers. \u201cI was there in the interrogation\nroom, too.\u201d His fingers drifted through her hair, gentle and calming. \u201cI was\nthere for all of it.\u201d\nThe pain struck deep, and she couldn\u2019t help the scream that worked its\nway out of her.\nHunt leaned forward, putting his cool brow against hers. \u201cI\u2019ve known\nwho you were this whole time. I never forgot you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m beginning extraction and stabilization of the venom,\u201d the witch\nsaid. \u201cIt will worsen, but it\u2019s almost over.\u201d\nBryce couldn\u2019t breathe. Couldn\u2019t think beyond Hunt and his words and\nthe pain in her leg, the scar across her very soul.\nHunt whispered, \u201cYou\u2019ve got this. You\u2019ve got this, Bryce.\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t. And the Hel that erupted in her leg had her arching against\nthe restraints, her vocal cords straining as her screaming filled the room.\nHunt\u2019s grip never wavered.\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost out,\u201d the witch hissed, grunting with effort. \u201cHang on,\nBryce.\u201d\nShe did. To Hunt, to his hand, to that softness in his eyes, she held on.\nWith all she had.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got you,\u201d he murmured. \u201cSweetheart, I\u2019ve got you.\u201d\nHe\u2019d never said it like that before\u2014that word. It had always been\nmocking, teasing. She\u2019d always found it just this side of annoying.\nNot this time. Not when he held her hand and her gaze and everything\nshe was. Riding out the pain with her.\n\u201cBreathe,\u201d he ordered her. \u201cYou can do it. We can get through this.\u201d\nGet through it\u2014together. Get through this mess of a life together.\nThrough this mess of a world. Bryce sobbed, not entirely from pain this\ntime.\nAnd Hunt, as if he sensed it, too, leaned forward again. Brushed his\nmouth against hers.\nJust a hint of a kiss\u2014a feather-soft glancing of his lips over hers.\nA star bloomed inside her at that kiss. A long-slumbering light began to\nfill her chest, her veins.\n\u201cBurning Solas,\u201d the witch whispered, and the pain ceased.\nLike a switch had been flipped, the pain was gone. It was startling\nenough that Bryce turned away from Hunt and peered at her body, the blood\non it, the gaping wound. She might have fainted at the sight of a good six\ninches of her leg lying open were it not for the thing that the witch held\nbetween a set of pincers, as if it were indeed a worm.\n\u201cIf my magic wasn\u2019t stabilizing the venom like this, it\u2019d be liquid,\u201d the\nwitch said, carefully moving the venom\u2014a clear, wriggling worm with\nblack flecks\u2014toward a glass jar. It writhed, like a living thing.\nThe witch deposited it in the jar and shut the lid, magic humming. The\npoison instantly dissolved into a puddle within, but still vibrated. As if\nlooking for a way out.\nHunt\u2019s eyes were still on Bryce\u2019s face. As they\u2019d been the entire time.\nHad never left.\n\u201cLet me clean you out and stitch you up, and then we\u2019ll test the\nantidote,\u201d the witch said.\nBryce barely heard the woman as she nodded. Barely heard anything\nbeyond Hunt\u2019s lingering words. I\u2019ve got you.\nHer fingers curled around his. She let her eyes tell him everything her\nravaged throat couldn\u2019t. I\u2019ve got you, too.\nThirty minutes later, Bryce was sitting up, Hunt\u2019s arm and wing around her,\nboth of them watching as the witch\u2019s glowing, pale magic wrapped around\nthe puddle of venom in the vial and warped it into a thin thread.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll forgive me if my method of antidote testing fails to qualify as a\nproper medical experiment,\u201d she declared as she walked over to where an\nordinary white pill sat in a clear plastic box. Lifting the lid, she dropped the\nthread of venom in. It fluttered like a ribbon, hovering above the pill before\nthe witch shut the lid again. \u201cWhat is being used on the street is a much\nmore potent version of this,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I want to see if this amount of\nmy healing magic, holding the venom in place and merging with it, will do\nthe trick against the synth.\u201d\nThe witch carefully let the thread of the magic-infused venom alight\non the tablet. It vanished within a blink, sucked into the pill. But the witch\u2019s\nface remained bunched in concentration. As if focused on whatever was\nhappening within the pill.\nBryce asked, \u201cSo your magic is currently stabilizing the venom in that\ntablet? Making it stop the synth?\u201d\n\u201cEssentially,\u201d the witch said distantly, still focused on the pill. \u201cIt takes\nmost of my concentration to keep it stable long enough to halt the synth.\nWhich is why I\u2019d like to find a way to remove myself from the equation\u2014\nso it can be used by anyone, even without me.\u201d\nBryce fell silent after that, letting the witch work in peace.\nNothing happened. The pill merely sat there.\nOne minute passed. Two. And just as it was nearing three minutes\u2014\nThe pill turned gray. And then dissolved into nothing but minuscule\nparticles that then faded away, too. Until there was nothing left.\nHunt said into the silence, \u201cIt worked?\u201d\nThe witch blinked at the now-empty box. \u201cIt would appear so.\u201d She\nturned to Bryce, sweat gleaming on her brow. \u201cI\u2019d like to continue testing\nthis, and try to find some way for the antidote to work without my magic\nstabilizing the venom. I can send over a vial for you when I\u2019m finished,\nthough, if you\u2019d like. Some people want to keep such reminders of their\nstruggles.\u201d\nBryce nodded blankly. And realized she had absolutely no idea what to\ndo next."}, "62": {"Name": "PART III THE CANYON-Chapter 62", "Page Content": " 2 \nJesiba hadn\u2019t seemed to care when Bryce explained that she needed the rest\nof the day off. She\u2019d just demanded that Bryce be in first thing tomorrow or\nbe turned into a donkey.\nHunt flew her home from the medwitch\u2019s office, going so far as to\ncarry her down the stairs from the roof of the apartment building and\nthrough her door. He deposited her on the couch, where he insisted she stay\nfor the remainder of the day, curled up beside him, snuggled into his\nwarmth.\nShe might have stayed there all afternoon and evening if Hunt\u2019s phone\nhadn\u2019t rung.\nHe\u2019d been in the midst of making her lunch when he picked up. \u201cHi,\nMicah.\u201d\nEven from across the room, Bryce could hear the Archangel\u2019s cold,\nbeautiful voice. \u201cMy office. Immediately. Bring Bryce Quinlan with you.\u201d\nWhile he dressed in his battle-suit and gathered his helmet and weapons,\nHunt debated telling Bryce to get on a train and get the fuck out of the city.\nHe knew this meeting with Micah wasn\u2019t going to be pleasant.\nBryce was limping, her wound still tender enough that he\u2019d grabbed\nher a pair of loose workout pants and helped her put them on in the middle\nof the living room. She\u2019d registered for a follow-up appointment in a\nmonth, and it only now occurred to Hunt that he might not be there to see it.\nEither because this case had wrapped up, or because of whatever the\nfuck was about to go down in the Comitium.\nBryce tried to take all of one step before Hunt picked her up, carrying\nher out of the apartment and into the skies. She barely spoke, and neither\ndid he. After this morning, what use were words? That too-brief kiss he\u2019d\ngiven her had said enough. So had the light he could have sworn glowed in\nher eyes as he\u2019d pulled away.\nA line had been crossed, one from which there was no walking away.\nHunt landed on a balcony of the Governor\u2019s spire\u2014the central of the\nComitium\u2019s five. The usually bustling hall of his public office was hushed.\nBad sign. He carried Bryce toward the chamber. If people had run, or Micah\nordered them out \u2026\nIf he saw Sandriel right now, if she realized Bryce was injured \u2026\nHunt\u2019s temper became a living, deadly thing. His lightning pushed\nagainst his skin, coiling through him, a cobra readying to strike.\nHe gently set Bryce down before the shut fogged-glass office doors.\nMade sure she was steady on her feet before he let go, stepping back to\nstudy every inch of her face.\nWorry shone in her eyes, enough of it that he leaned in, brushing a kiss\nover her temple. \u201cChin up, Quinlan,\u201d he murmured against her soft skin.\n\u201cLet\u2019s see you do that fancy trick where you somehow look down your nose\nat people a foot taller than you.\u201d\nShe chuckled, smacking him lightly on the arm. Hunt pulled away with\na half smile of his own before opening the doors and guiding Bryce through\nwith a hand on her back. He knew it would likely be his last smile for a\nlong while. But he\u2019d be damned if he let Quinlan know it. Even as they\nbeheld who stood in Micah\u2019s office.\nTo the left of the Governor\u2019s desk stood Sabine, arms crossed and\nspine rigid, the portrait of cold fury. A tight-faced Amelie lingered at her\nside.\nHe knew precisely what this meeting was about.\nMicah stood at the window, his face glacial with distaste. Isaiah and\nViktoria flanked his desk. The former\u2019s eyes flashed with warning.\nBryce glanced between them all and hesitated.\nHunt said quietly to Micah, to Sabine, \u201cQuinlan doesn\u2019t need to be\nhere for this.\u201d\nSabine\u2019s silvery blond hair shimmered in the firstlight lamps as she\nsaid, \u201cOh, she does. I want her here for every second.\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t bother asking if it\u2019s true,\u201d Micah said to Hunt as he and Bryce\nstopped in the center of the room. The doors shut behind them. Locking.\nHunt braced himself.\nMicah said, \u201cThere were six cameras in the bar. They all captured what\nyou did and said to Amelie Ravenscroft. She reported your behavior to\nSabine, and Sabine brought it directly to me.\u201d\nAmelie flushed. \u201cI just mentioned it to her,\u201d she amended. \u201cI didn\u2019t\nhowl like a pup about it.\u201d\n\u201cIt is unacceptable,\u201d Sabine hissed to Micah. \u201cYou think you can set\nyour assassin on a member of one of my packs? My heir?\u201d\n\u201cI will tell you again, Sabine,\u201d Micah said, bored, \u201cI did not set Hunt\nAthalar upon her. He acted of his own free will.\u201d A glance at Bryce. \u201cHe\nacted on behalf of his companion.\u201d\nHunt said quickly, \u201cBryce had nothing to do with this. Amelie pulled a\nbullshit prank and I decided to pay her a visit.\u201d He bared his teeth at the\nyoung Alpha, who swallowed hard.\nSabine snapped, \u201cYou assaulted my captain.\u201d\n\u201cI told Amelie to stay the fuck away,\u201d Hunt bit out. \u201cTo leave her\nalone.\u201d He angled his head, unable to stop the words. \u201cOr are you unaware\nthat Amelie has been gunning for Bryce since your daughter died? Taunting\nher about it? Calling her trash?\u201d\nSabine\u2019s face didn\u2019t so much as flinch. \u201cWhat does it matter, if it\u2019s\ntrue?\u201d\nHunt\u2019s head filled with roaring. But Bryce just stood there. And\nlowered her eyes.\nSabine said to Micah, \u201cThis cannot go unpunished. You fumbled the\ninvestigation of my daughter\u2019s murder. You allowed these two to poke their\nnoses into it, to accuse me of killing her. And now this. I\u2019m one breath away\nfrom telling this city how your slaves cannot even stay in line. I\u2019m sure\nyour current guest will be highly interested in that little fact.\u201d\nMicah\u2019s power rumbled at the mention of Sandriel. \u201cAthalar will be\npunished.\u201d\n\u201cNow. Here.\u201d Sabine\u2019s face was positively lupine. \u201cWhere I can see\nit.\u201d\n\u201cSabine,\u201d Amelie murmured. Sabine growled at her young captain.\nSabine had been hoping for this moment\u2014had used Amelie as an\nexcuse. No doubt dragged the wolf here. Sabine had sworn they\u2019d pay for\naccusing her of murdering Danika. And Sabine was, Hunt supposed, a\nfemale of her word.\n\u201cYour position among the wolves,\u201d Micah said with terrifying calm,\n\u201cdoes not entitle you to tell a Governor of the Republic what to do.\u201d\nSabine didn\u2019t back down. Not an inch.\nMicah just loosed a long breath. He met Hunt\u2019s eyes, disappointed.\n\u201cYou acted foolishly. I\u2019d have thought you, at least, would know better.\u201d\nBryce was shaking. But Hunt didn\u2019t dare touch her.\n\u201cHistory indicates that a slave assaulting a free citizen should\nautomatically forfeit their life.\u201d\nHunt suppressed a bitter laugh at her words. Wasn\u2019t that what he\u2019d\nbeen doing for the Archangels for centuries now?\n\u201cPlease,\u201d Bryce whispered.\nAnd perhaps it was sympathy that softened the Archangel\u2019s face as\nMicah said, \u201cThose are old traditions. For Pangera, not Valbara.\u201d Sabine\nopened her mouth, objecting, but Micah lifted a hand. \u201cHunt Athalar will be\npunished. And he shall die\u2014in the way that angels die.\u201d\nBryce lurched a limping step toward Micah. Hunt grabbed her by the\nshoulder, halting her.\nMicah said, \u201cThe Living Death.\u201d\nHunt\u2019s blood chilled. But he bowed his head. He had been ready to\nface the consequences since he\u2019d shot into the skies yesterday, pastry box in\nhis hands.\nBryce looked at Isaiah, whose face was grim, for an explanation. The\ncommander said to her, to the confused Amelie, \u201cThe Living Death is when\nan angel\u2019s wings are cut off.\u201d\nBryce shook her head. \u201cNo, please\u2014\u201d\nBut Hunt met Micah\u2019s rock-solid stare, read the fairness in it. He\nlowered himself to his knees and removed his jacket, then his shirt.\n\u201cI don\u2019t need to press charges,\u201d Amelie insisted. \u201cSabine, I don\u2019t want\nthis. Let it go.\u201d\nMicah stalked toward Hunt, a shining double-edged sword appearing\nin his hand.\nBryce flung herself in the Archangel\u2019s path. \u201cPlease\u2014please\u2014\u201d The\nscent of her tears filled the office.\nViktoria instantly appeared at her side. Holding her back. The wraith\u2019s\nwhisper was so quiet Hunt barely heard it. \u201cThey will grow back. In several\nweeks, his wings will grow back.\u201d\nBut it would hurt like Hel. Hurt so badly that Hunt now took\nsteadying, bracing breaths. Plunged down into himself, into that place\nwhere he rode out everything that had ever been done to him, every task\nhe\u2019d been assigned, every life he\u2019d been ordered to take.\n\u201cSabine, no,\u201d Amelie insisted. \u201cIt\u2019s gone far enough.\u201d\nSabine said nothing. Just stood there.\nHunt spread his wings and lifted them, holding them high over his\nback so the slice might be clean.\nBryce began shouting something, but Hunt only looked at Micah. \u201cDo\nit.\u201d\nMicah didn\u2019t so much as nod before his sword moved.\nPain, such as Hunt had not experienced in two hundred years, raced\nthrough him, short-circuiting every\u2014\nHunt jolted into consciousness to Bryce screaming.\nIt was enough of a summons that he forced his head to clear, even\naround the agony down his back, his soul.\nHe must have blacked out only for a moment, because his wings were\nstill spurting blood from where they lay like two fallen branches on the\nfloor of Micah\u2019s office.\nAmelie looked like she was going to be sick; Sabine was smirking, and\nBryce was now at his side, his blood soaking her pants, her hands, as she\nsobbed, \u201cOh gods, oh gods\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re settled,\u201d Sabine said to Micah, who punched a button on his\nphone to call for a medwitch.\nHe\u2019d paid for his actions, and it was over, and he could go home with\nBryce\u2014\n\u201cYou are a disgrace, Sabine.\u201d Bryce\u2019s words speared through the room\nas she bared her teeth at the Prime Apparent. \u201cYou are a disgrace to every\nwolf who has ever walked this planet.\u201d\nSabine said, \u201cI don\u2019t care what a half-breed thinks of me.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t deserve Danika,\u201d Bryce growled, shaking. \u201cYou didn\u2019t\ndeserve her for one second.\u201d\nSabine halted. \u201cI didn\u2019t deserve a selfish, spineless brat for a daughter,\nbut that\u2019s not how it turned out, is it?\u201d\nDimly, from far away, Bryce\u2019s snarl cut through Hunt\u2019s pain. He\ncouldn\u2019t reach her in time, though, as she surged to her feet, wincing in\nagony at her still-healing leg.\nMicah stepped in front of her. Bryce panted, sobbing through her teeth.\nBut Micah stood there, immovable as a mountain. \u201cTake Athalar out of\nhere,\u201d the Archangel said calmly, the dismissal clear. \u201cTo your home, the\nbarracks, I don\u2019t care.\u201d\nBut Sabine, it seemed, had decided to stay. To give Bryce a piece of\nher vicious mind.\nSabine said to her, low and venomous, \u201cI sought out the Under-King\nlast winter, did you know that? To get answers from my daughter, with\nwhatever speck of her energy lives on in the Sleeping City.\u201d\nBryce stilled. The pure stillness of the Fae. Dread filled her eyes.\n\u201cDo you know what he told me?\u201d Sabine\u2019s face was inhuman. \u201cHe said\nthat Danika would not come. She would not obey my summons. My\npathetic daughter would not even deign to meet me in her afterlife. For the\nshame of what she did. How she died, helpless and screaming, begging like\none of you.\u201d Sabine seemed to hum with rage. \u201cAnd do you know what the\nUnder-King told me when I demanded again that he summon her?\u201d\nNo one else dared speak.\n\u201cHe told me that you, you piece of trash, had made a bargain with him.\nFor her. That you had gone to him after her death and traded your spot in\nthe Bone Quarter in exchange for Danika\u2019s passage. That you worried she\nwould be denied access because of her cowardly death and begged him to\ntake her in your stead.\u201d\nEven Hunt\u2019s pain paused at that.\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t why I went!\u201d Bryce snapped. \u201cDanika wasn\u2019t a coward\nfor one fucking moment of her life!\u201d Her voice broke as she shouted the last\nwords.\n\u201cYou had no right,\u201d Sabine exploded. \u201cShe was a coward, and died\nlike one, and deserved to be dumped into the river!\u201d The Alpha was\nscreaming. \u201cAnd now she is left with eons of shame because of you!\nBecause she should not be there, you stupid whore. And now she must\nsuffer for it!\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d Micah said, his words conveying his order. Get out.\nSabine just let out a dead, cold laugh and turned on her heel.\nBryce was still sobbing when Sabine strutted out, a stunned Amelie on\nher heels. The latter murmured as she shut the door, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nBryce spat at her.\nIt was the last thing Hunt saw before darkness swept in again.\nShe would never forgive them. Any of them.\nHunt remained unconscious while the medwitches worked on him in\nMicah\u2019s office, stitching him up so that the stumps where his wings had\nbeen stopped spurting blood onto the floor, then dressing the wounds in\nbandages that would promote quick growth. No firstlight\u2014apparently, its\naid in healing wasn\u2019t allowed for the Living Death. It would delegitimize\nthe punishment.\nBryce knelt with Hunt the entire time, his head in her lap. She didn\u2019t\nhear Micah telling her how the alternative was Hunt being dead\u2014officially\nand irrevocably dead.\nShe stroked Hunt\u2019s hair as they lay in her bed an hour later, his\nbreathing still deep and even. Give him the healing potion every six hours,\nthe medwitch ordered her. It will stave off the pain, too.\nIsaiah and Naomi had carried them home, and she\u2019d barely let them\nlay Hunt facedown on her mattress before she\u2019d ordered them to get out.\nShe hadn\u2019t expected Sabine to understand why she\u2019d given up her\nplace in the Bone Quarter for Danika. Sabine never listened when Danika\nspoke about how she\u2019d one day be buried there, in full honor, with all the\nother great heroes of her House. Living on, as that small speck of energy,\nfor eternity. Still a part of the city she loved so much.\nBryce had seen people\u2019s boats tip. Would never forget Danika\u2019s half-\nmuffled pleading on the audio of the apartment building\u2019s hall camera.\nBryce hadn\u2019t been willing to make the gamble that the boat might not\nreach the far shore. Not for Danika.\nShe\u2019d tossed a Death Mark into the Istros, payment to the Under-King\n\u2014a coin of pure iron from an ancient, long-gone kingdom across the sea.\nPassage for a mortal on a boat.\nAnd then she\u2019d knelt on the crumbling stone steps, the river mere feet\nbehind her, the arches of the bone gates above her, and waited.\nThe Under-King, veiled in black and silent as death, had appeared\nmoments later.\nIt has been an age since a mortal dared set foot on my isle.\nThe voice had been old and young, male and female, kind and full of\nhatred. She\u2019d never heard anything so hideous\u2014and beckoning.\nI wish to trade my place.\nI know why you are here, Bryce Quinlan. Whose passage you seek to\nbarter. An amused pause. Do you not wish to one day dwell here among the\nhonored dead? Your balance remains skewed toward acceptance\u2014continue\non your path, and you shall be welcomed when your time comes.\nI wish to trade my place. For Danika Fendyr.\nDo this and know that no other Quiet Realms of Midgard shall be open\nto you. Not the Bone Quarter, not the Catacombs of the Eternal City, not the\nSummer Isles of the north. None, Bryce Quinlan. To barter your resting\nplace here is to barter your place everywhere.\nI wish to trade my place.\nYou are young, and you are weighed with grief. Consider that your life\nmay seem long, but it is a mere flutter of eternity.\nI wish to trade my place.\nAre you so certain Danika Fendyr will be denied welcome? Have you\nso little faith in her actions and deeds that you must make this bargain?\nI wish to trade my place. She\u2019d sobbed the words.\nThere is no undoing this.\nI wish to trade my place.\nThen say it, Bryce Quinlan, and let the trade be done. Say it a seventh\nand final time, and let the gods and the dead and all those between hear\nyour vow. Say it, and it shall be done.\nShe hadn\u2019t hesitated, knowing this was the ancient rite. She\u2019d looked it\nup in the gallery archives. Had stolen the Death Mark from there, too. It had\nbeen given to Jesiba by the Under-King himself, the sorceress had told her,\nwhen she\u2019d sworn fealty to the House of Flame and Shadow.\nI wish to trade my place.\nAnd so it had been done.\nBryce had not felt any different afterward, when she\u2019d been sent back\nover the river. Or in the days after that. Even her mother had not been able\nto tell\u2014hadn\u2019t noticed that Bryce had snuck from her hotel room in the\ndead of night.\nIn the two years since, Bryce had sometimes wondered if she\u2019d\ndreamed it, but then she\u2019d look through the drawer in the gallery where all\nthe old coins were kept and see the empty, dark spot where the Death Mark\nhad been. Jesiba had never noticed it was gone.\nBryce liked to think of her chance at eternal rest as missing with it. To\nimagine the coins nestled in their velvet compartments in the drawer as all\nthe souls of those she loved, dwelling together forever. And there was hers\n\u2014missing and drifting, wiped away the moment she died.\nBut what Sabine had claimed about Danika suffering in the Bone\nQuarter \u2026 Bryce refused to believe it. Because the alternative\u2014No. Danika\nhad deserved to go to the Bone Quarter, had nothing to be ashamed about,\nwhether Sabine or the other assholes disagreed or not. Whether the Under-\nKing or whoever the Hel deemed their souls worthy disagreed or not.\nBryce ran her hand through Hunt\u2019s silken hair, the sounds of his\nbreathing filling the room.\nIt sucked. This stupid fucking world they lived in.\nIt sucked, and it was full of awful people. And the good ones always\npaid for it.\nShe pulled her phone from the nightstand and began typing out a\nmessage.\nShe fired it off a moment later, not giving herself time to reconsider\nwhat she\u2019d written to Ithan. Her first message to him in two years. His\nfrantic messages from that horrible night, then his cold order to stay away,\nwere still the last things in a thread that went back five years before that.\nYou tell your Alpha that Connor never bothered to notice her because\nhe always knew what a piece of shit she was. And tell Sabine that if I see\nher again, I will kill her.\nBryce lay down next to Hunt, not daring to touch his ravaged back.\nHer phone buzzed. Ithan had written, I had no part in what went down\ntoday.\nBryce wrote back, You disgust me. All of you.\nIthan didn\u2019t reply, and she put her phone on silent before she let out a\nlong breath and leaned her brow against Hunt\u2019s shoulder.\nShe\u2019d find a way to make this right. Somehow. Someday.\nHunt\u2019s eyes cracked open, pain a steady throb through him. Its sharpness\nwas dulled\u2014likely by some sort of potion or concoction of drugs.\nThe steady counterweight that should have been on his back was gone.\nThe emptiness hit him like a semitruck. But soft, feminine breathing filled\nthe darkness. A scent like paradise filled his nose, settled him. Soothed the\npain.\nHis eyes adjusted to the dark enough to know that he was in Bryce\u2019s\nbedroom. That she was lying beside him. Medical supplies and vials lay\nnext to the bed. All for him, many looking used. The clock read four in the\nmorning. How many hours had she sat up, tending to him?\nHer hands were tucked in at her chest, as if she had fallen asleep\nbeseeching the gods.\nHe mouthed her name, his tongue as dry as sandpaper.\nPain rippled through his body, but he managed to stretch out an arm.\nManaged to slide it over her waist and tuck her into him. She made a soft\nsound and nuzzled her head into his neck.\nSomething deep in him shifted and settled. What she\u2019d said and done\ntoday, what she\u2019d revealed to the world in her pleading for him \u2026 It was\ndangerous. For both of them. So, so dangerous.\nIf he were wise, he\u2019d find somehow to pull away. Before this thing\nbetween them met its inevitable, horrible end. As all things in the Republic\nmet a horrible end.\nAnd yet Hunt couldn\u2019t bring himself to remove his arm. To avoid the\ninstinct to breathe in her scent and listen to her soft breathing.\nHe didn\u2019t regret it, what he\u2019d done. Not one bit of it.\nBut there might come a day when that wouldn\u2019t be true. A day that\nmight dawn very soon.\nSo Hunt savored the feel of Bryce. Her scent and breathing.\nSavored every second of it."}, "63": {"Name": "PART III THE CANYON-Chapter 63", "Page Content": " 3 \n\u201cIs Athie okay, BB?\u201d\nBryce rubbed her eyes as she studied the computer screen in the\ngallery library. \u201cHe\u2019s sleeping it off.\u201d\nLehabah had cried this morning when Bryce had trudged in to tell her\nwhat had occurred. She\u2019d barely noticed that her leg had no pain\u2014not a\nwhisper. She\u2019d wanted to stay home, to care for Hunt, but when she\u2019d\ncalled Jesiba, the answer had been clear: No.\nShe\u2019d spent the first half of the morning filling out job applications.\nAnd had sent each and every one of them in.\nShe didn\u2019t know where the Hel she would end up, but getting out of\nthis place was the first step. Of many.\nShe\u2019d taken a few more today.\nRuhn had picked up on the first ring, and come right over to the\napartment.\nHunt had still been asleep when she\u2019d left him in her brother\u2019s care.\nShe didn\u2019t want anyone from that fucking legion in her house. Didn\u2019t want\nto see Isaiah or Viktoria or any of the triarii anytime soon.\nRuhn had taken one glance at Hunt\u2019s mutilated back and gagged. But\nhe\u2019d promised to stay on the pills-and-wound-care schedule she laid out for\nhim.\n\u201cMicah went easy on him,\u201d Ruhn said when she stopped by at lunch,\ntoying with one of his earrings. \u201cReally fucking easy. Sabine had the right\nto call for his death.\u201d As a slave, Hunt had no rights whatsoever. None.\n\u201cI will never forget it as long as I live,\u201d Bryce answered, her voice\ndull. The flash of Micah\u2019s sword. Hunt\u2019s scream, as if his soul was being\nshredded. Sabine\u2019s smile.\n\u201cI should have been the one to shut Amelie up.\u201d Shadows flickered in\nthe room.\n\u201cWell, you weren\u2019t.\u201d She measured the potion for Ruhn to give Hunt at\nthe top of the hour.\nRuhn stretched an arm over the back of the sofa. \u201cI\u2019d like to be,\nBryce.\u201d\nShe met her brother\u2019s gaze. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cBecause you\u2019re my sister.\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t have a response\u2014not yet.\nShe could have sworn hurt flashed in his eyes at her silence. She was\nout of her apartment in another minute, and barely reached the gallery\nbefore Jesiba had called, raging about how Bryce wasn\u2019t ready for the two\no\u2019clock meeting with the owl shifter who was ready to buy a marble\nstatuette worth three million gold marks.\nBryce executed the meeting, and the sale, and didn\u2019t hear half of what\nwas said.\nSign, stamp, goodbye.\nShe returned to the library by three. Lehabah warmed her shoulder as\nshe opened her laptop. \u201cWhy are you on Redner Industries\u2019 site?\u201d\nBryce just stared at the two small fields:\nUsername. Password.\nShe typed in dfendyr. The cursor hovered over the password.\nSomeone might be tipped off that she was trying to get in. And if she\ndid get access, someone might very well receive an alert. But \u2026 It was a\nrisk worth taking. She was out of options.\nLehabah read the username. \u201cDoes this somehow tie in to the Horn?\u201d\n\u201cDanika knew something\u2014something big,\u201d Bryce mused.\nPassword. What would Danika\u2019s password be?\nRedner Industries would have told her to write something random and\nfull of symbols.\nDanika would have hated being told what to do, and would have done\nthe opposite.\nBryce typed in SabineSucks.\nNo luck. Though she\u2019d done it the other day, she again typed in\nDanika\u2019s birthday. Her own birthday. The holy numbers. Nothing.\nHer phone buzzed, and a message from Ruhn lit up her screen.\nHe woke up, took his potions like a good boy, and demanded to know\nwhere you were.\nRuhn added, He\u2019s not a bad male.\nShe wrote back, No, he\u2019s not.\nRuhn replied, He\u2019s sleeping again, but seemed in good enough spirits,\nall things considered.\nA pause, and then her brother wrote, He told me to tell you thanks. For\neverything.\nBryce read the messages three times before she looked at the interface\nagain. And typed in the only other password she could think of. The words\nwritten on the back of a leather jacket she\u2019d worn constantly for the last two\nyears. The words inked on her own back in an ancient alphabet. Danika\u2019s\nfavorite phrase, whispered to her by the Oracle on her sixteenth birthday.\nThe Old Language of the Fae didn\u2019t work. Neither did the formal\ntongue of the Asteri.\nSo she wrote it in the common language.\nThrough love, all is possible.\nThe login screen vanished. And a list of files appeared.\nMost were reports on Redner\u2019s latest projects: improving tracking quality\non phones; comparing the speed at which shifters could change forms;\nanalyzing the healing rates of witch magic versus Redner medicines. Boring\neveryday science.\nShe\u2019d almost given up when she noticed a subfolder: Party Invites.\nDanika had never been organized enough to keep such things, let alone\nput them in a folder. She either deleted them right away or let them rot in\nher inbox, unanswered.\nIt was enough of an anomaly that Bryce clicked on it and found a list\nof folders within. Including one titled Bryce.\nA file with her name on it. Hidden in another file. Exactly as Bryce\nhad hidden her own job applications on this computer.\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d Lehabah whispered at her shoulder.\nBryce opened the file. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I never sent invites to her work\naddress.\u201d\nThe folder contained a single photo.\n\u201cWhy does she have a picture of her old jacket?\u201d Lehabah asked. \u201cWas\nshe going to sell it?\u201d\nBryce stared and stared at the image. Then she moved, logging out of\nthe account before running up the stairs to the showroom, where she\ngrabbed the leather jacket from her chair.\n\u201cIt was a clue,\u201d she said breathlessly to Lehabah as she flew back\ndown the stairs, fingers running and pawing over every seam of the jacket.\n\u201cThe photo is a fucking clue\u2014\u201d\nSomething hard snagged her fingers. A lump. Right along the vertical\nline of the L in love.\n\u201cThrough love, all is possible,\u201d Bryce whispered, and grabbed a pair of\nscissors from the cup on the table. Danika had even tattooed the hint on\nBryce\u2019s fucking back, for fuck\u2019s sake. Lehabah peered over her shoulder as\nBryce cut into the leather.\nA small, thin metal rectangle fell onto the table. A flash drive.\n\u201cWhy would she hide that in her coat?\u201d Lehabah asked, but Bryce was\nalready moving again, hands shaking as she fitted the drive into the slot on\nher laptop.\nThree unmarked videos lay within.\nShe opened the first video. She and Lehabah watched in silence.\nLehabah\u2019s whisper filled the library, even over the scratching of the\nn\u00f8kk.\n\u201cGods spare us.\u201d"}, "64": {"Name": "PART III THE CANYON-Chapter 64", "Page Content": " 4 \nHunt had managed to get out of bed and prove himself alive enough that\nRuhn Danaan had finally left. He had no doubt the Fae Prince had called his\ncousin to inform her, but it didn\u2019t matter: Bryce was home in fifteen\nminutes.\nHer face was white as death, so ashen that her freckles stood out like\nsplattered blood. No sign of anything else amiss, not one thread on her\nblack dress out of place.\n\u201cWhat.\u201d He was instantly at the door, wincing as he surged from where\nhe\u2019d been on the couch watching the evening news coverage of Rigelus,\nBright Hand of the Asteri, giving a pretty speech about the rebel conflict in\nPangera. It\u2019d be another day or two before he could walk without pain.\nAnother several weeks until his wings grew back. A few days after that until\nhe could test out flying. Tomorrow, probably, the insufferable itching would\nbegin.\nHe remembered every miserable second from the first time he\u2019d had\nhis wings cut off. All the surviving Fallen had endured it. Along with the\ninsult of having their wings displayed in the crystal palace of the Asteri as\ntrophies and warnings.\nBut she first asked, \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d\n\u201cFine.\u201d Lie. Syrinx pranced at his feet, showering his hand with kisses.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nBryce wordlessly closed the door. Shut the curtains. Yanked out her\nphone from her jacket pocket, pulled up an email\u2014from herself to herself\n\u2014and clicked on an attached file. \u201cDanika had a flash drive hidden in the\nlining of her jacket,\u201d Bryce said, voice shaking, and led him back to the\ncouch, helping him to sit as the video loaded. Syrinx leapt onto the\ncushions, curling up beside him. Bryce sat on his other side, so close their\nthighs pressed together. She didn\u2019t seem to notice. After a heartbeat, Hunt\ndidn\u2019t, either.\nIt was grainy, soundless footage of a padded cell.\nAt the bottom of the video, a ticker read: Artificial Amplification for\nPower Dysfunction, Test Subject 7.\nA too-thin human female sat in the room in a med-gown. \u201cWhat the\nfuck is this?\u201d Hunt asked. But he already knew.\nSynth. These were the synth research trials.\nBryce grunted\u2014keep watching.\nA young draki male in a lab coat entered the room, bearing a tray of\nsupplies. The video sped up, as if someone had increased the speed of the\nfootage for the sake of urgency. The draki male took her vitals and then\ninjected something into her arm.\nThen he left. Locked the door.\n\u201cAre they \u2026\u201d Hunt swallowed. \u201cDid he just inject her with synth?\u201d\nBryce made a small, confirming noise in her throat.\nThe camera kept rolling. A minute passed. Five. Ten.\nTwo Vanir walked into the room. Two large serpentine shifters who\nsized up the human female locked in alone with them. Hunt\u2019s stomach\nturned. Turned further at the slave tattoos on their arms, and knew that they\nwere prisoners. Knew, from the way they smiled at the human female\nshrinking against the wall, why they had been locked up.\nThey lunged for her.\nBut the human female lunged, too.\nIt happened so fast that Hunt could barely track it. The person who had\nedited the footage went back and slowed it, too.\nSo he watched, blow by blow, as the human female launched herself at\nthe two Vanir males.\nAnd ripped them to pieces.\nIt was impossible. Utterly impossible. Unless\u2014\nTharion had said synth could temporarily grant humans powers greater\nthan most Vanir. Powers enough to kill.\n\u201cDo you know how badly the human rebels would want this?\u201d Hunt\nsaid. Bryce just jerked her chin toward the screen. Where the footage kept\ngoing.\nThey sent in two other males. Bigger than the last. And they, too,\nwound up in pieces.\nPiles.\nOh gods.\nAnother two. Then three. Then five.\nUntil the entire room was red. Until the Vanir were clawing at the\ndoors, begging to be let out. Begging as their companions, then they\nthemselves, were slaughtered.\nThe human female was screaming, her head tilted to the ceiling.\nScreaming in rage or pain or what, he couldn\u2019t tell without the sound.\nHunt knew what was coming next. Knew, and couldn\u2019t stop himself\nfrom watching.\nShe turned on herself. Ripped herself apart. Until she, too, was a pile\non the floor.\nThe footage cut out.\nBryce said softly, \u201cDanika must have figured out what they were\nworking on in the labs. I think someone involved in these tests \u2026 Could\nthey have sold the formula to some drug boss? Whoever killed Danika and\nthe pack and the others must have been high on this synth. Or injected\nsomeone with it and sicced them on the victims.\u201d\nHunt shook his head. \u201cMaybe, but how does it tie in to the demons and\nthe Horn?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe they summoned the kristallos for the antidote in its venom\u2014\nand nothing more. They wanted to try to make an antidote of their own, in\ncase the synth ever turned on them. Maybe it doesn\u2019t connect to the Horn at\nall,\u201d Bryce said. \u201cMaybe this is what we were meant to find. There are two\nother videos like this, of two different human subjects. Danika left them for\nme. She must have known someone was coming for her. Must have known\nwhen she was on that Aux boat, confiscating that crate of synth, that they\u2019d\ncome after her soon. There was no second type of demon hunting alongside\nthe kristallos. Just a person\u2014from this world. Someone who was high on\nthe synth and used its power to break through our apartment\u2019s\nenchantments. And then had the strength to kill Danika and the whole\npack.\u201d\nHunt considered his next words carefully, fighting against his racing\nmind. \u201cIt could work, Bryce. But the Horn is still out there, with a drug that\nmight be able to repair it, coincidence or no. And we\u2019re no closer to finding\nit.\u201d No, this just led them a Hel of a lot closer to trouble. He added, \u201cMicah\nalready demonstrated what it means to set one foot out of line. We need to\ngo slow on the synth hunt. Make sure we\u2019re certain this time. And careful.\u201d\n\u201cNone of you were able to find out anything like this. Why should I go\nslow with the only clue I have about who killed Danika and the Pack of\nDevils? This ties in, Hunt. I know it does.\u201d\nAnd because she was opening her mouth to object again, he said what\nhe knew would stop her. \u201cBryce, if we pursue this and we\u2019re wrong, if\nMicah learns about another fuckup, forget the bargain being over. I might\nnot walk away from his next punishment.\u201d\nShe flinched.\nHis entire body protested as he reached a hand to touch her knee. \u201cThis\nsynth shit is horrific, Bryce. I \u2026 I\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u201d It\nchanged everything. Everything. He didn\u2019t even know where to begin\nsorting out all he\u2019d seen. He should make some phone calls\u2014needed to\nmake some phone calls about this. \u201cBut to find the murderer and maybe the\nHorn, and to make sure there\u2019s an afterward for you and me\u201d\u2014because\nthere would be a you and me for them; he\u2019d do whatever it took to ensure it\n\u2014\u201cwe need to be smart.\u201d He nodded to the footage. \u201cForward that to me.\nI\u2019ll make sure it gets to Vik on our encrypted server. See what she can dig\nup about these trials.\u201d\nBryce scanned his face. The openness in her expression nearly sent\nhim to his knees before her. Hunt waited for her to argue, to defy him. To\ntell him he was an idiot.\nBut she only said, \u201cOkay.\u201d She let out a long breath, slumping back\nagainst the cushions.\nShe was so fucking beautiful he could barely stand it. Could barely\nstand to hear her ask quietly, \u201cWhat sort of an afterward for you and me do\nyou have in mind, Athalar?\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t balk from her searching gaze. \u201cThe good kind,\u201d he said with\nequal quiet.\nShe didn\u2019t ask, though. About how it would be possible. How any of it\nwould be possible for him, for them. What he\u2019d do to make it so.\nHer lips curved upward. \u201cSounds like a plan to me.\u201d\nFor a moment, an eternity, they stared at each other.\nAnd despite what they\u2019d just watched, what lurked in the world\nbeyond the apartment, Hunt said, \u201cYeah?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d She toyed with the ends of her hair. \u201cHunt. You kissed me\u2014at\nthe medwitch\u2019s office.\u201d\nHe knew he shouldn\u2019t, knew it was ten kinds of stupid, but he said,\n\u201cWhat about it?\u201d\n\u201cDid you mean it?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d He\u2019d never said anything more true. \u201cDid you want me to mean\nit?\u201d\nHis heart began to race, fast enough that he nearly forgot the pain\nalong his back as she said, \u201cYou know the answer to that, Athalar.\u201d\n\u201cDo you want me to do it again?\u201d Fuck, his voice had dropped an\noctave.\nHer eyes were clear, bright. Fearless and hopeful and everything that\nhad always made it impossible for him to think about anything else if she\nwas around. \u201cI want to do it.\u201d She added, \u201cIf that\u2019s all right with you.\u201d\nHel, yes. He made himself throw her a half smile. \u201cDo your worst,\nQuinlan.\u201d\nShe let out a breathy little laugh and turned her face up toward his.\nHunt didn\u2019t so much as inhale too deeply for fear of startling her. Syrinx,\napparently taking the hint, saw himself into his crate.\nBryce\u2019s hands shook as they lifted to his hair, brushed back a strand,\nthen ran over the band of the halo.\nHunt gripped her trembling fingers. \u201cWhat\u2019s this about?\u201d he\nmurmured, unable to help himself from pressing his mouth to the dusky\nnails. How many times had he thought about these hands on him? Caressing\nhis face, stroking down his chest, wrapped around his cock?\nHer swallow was audible. He pressed another kiss to her fingers.\n\u201cThis wasn\u2019t supposed to happen\u2014between us,\u201d she whispered.\n\u201cI know,\u201d he said, kissing her shaking fingers again. He gently\nunfurled them, exposing the heart of her palm. He pressed his mouth there,\ntoo. \u201cBut thank fucking Urd it did.\u201d\nHer hands stopped shaking. Hunt lifted his eyes from her hand to find\nher own lined with silver\u2014and full of fire. He interlaced their fingers. \u201cFor\nfuck\u2019s sake, just kiss me, Quinlan.\u201d\nShe did. Dark Hel, she did. His words had barely finished sounding\nwhen she slid her hand over his jaw, around his neck, and hauled his lips to\nhers.\nThe moment Hunt\u2019s lips met her own, Bryce erupted.\nShe didn\u2019t know if it was weeks without sex or Hunt himself, but she\nunleashed herself. That was the only way to describe it as she drove her\nhands into his hair and slanted her mouth against his.\nNo tentative, sweet kisses. Not for them. Never for them.\nHer mouth opened at that first contact, and his tongue swept in, tasting\nher in savage, unrelenting strokes. Hunt groaned at that first taste\u2014and the\nsound was kindling.\nRising onto her knees, fingers digging into his soft hair, she couldn\u2019t\nget enough, taste enough of him\u2014rain and cedar and salt and pure\nlightning. His hands skimmed over her hips, slow and steady despite the\nmouth that ravaged hers with fierce, deep kisses.\nHis tongue danced with her own. She whimpered, and he let out a dark\nlaugh as his hand wandered under the back of her dress, down the length of\nher spine, his calluses scraping. She arched into the touch, and he tore his\nmouth away.\nBefore she could grab his face back to hers, his lips found her neck. He\npressed openmouthed kisses to it, nipped at the sensitive skin beneath her\nears. \u201cTell me what you want, Quinlan.\u201d\n\u201cAll of it.\u201d There was no doubt in her. None.\nHunt dragged his teeth along the side of her neck, and she panted, her\nentire consciousness narrowing to the sensation. \u201cAll of it?\u201d\nShe slid her hand down his front. To his pants\u2014the hard, considerable\nlength straining against them. Urd spare her. She palmed his cock, eliciting\na hiss from him. \u201cAll of it, Athalar.\u201d\n\u201cThank fuck,\u201d he breathed against her neck, and she laughed.\nHer laugh died as he put his mouth on hers again, as if he needed to\ntaste the sound, too.\nTongues and teeth and breath, his hands artfully unhooking her bra\nunder her dress. She wound up straddling his lap, wound up grinding\nherself over that beautiful, perfect hardness in his lap. Wound up with her\ndress peeled down to her waist, her bra gone, and then Hunt\u2019s mouth and\nteeth were around her breast, suckling and biting and kissing, and nothing,\nnothing, nothing had ever felt this good, this right.\nBryce didn\u2019t care that she was moaning loud enough for every demon\nin the Pit to hear. Not as Hunt switched to her other breast, sucking her\nnipple deep into his mouth. She drove her hips down on his, release already\na rising wave in her. \u201cFuck, Bryce,\u201d he murmured against her breast.\nShe only dove her hand beneath the waist of his pants. His hand\nwrapped around her wrist, though. Halted her millimeters from what she\u2019d\nwanted in her hands, her mouth, her body for weeks.\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d he growled, dragging his tongue along the underside of her\nbreast. Content to feast on her. \u201cNot until I\u2019ve had my turn.\u201d\nThe words short-circuited every logical thought. And any objections\ndied as he slipped a hand up her dress, running it over her thigh. Higher. His\nmouth found her neck again as a finger explored the lacy front of her\nunderwear.\nHe hissed again as he found it utterly soaked, the lace doing nothing to\nhide the proof of just how badly she wanted this, wanted him. He ran his\nfinger down the length of her\u2014and back up again.\nThen that finger landed on that spot at the apex of her thighs. His\nthumb gently pressed on it over the fabric, drawing a moan deep from her\nthroat.\nShe felt him smile against her neck. His thumb slowly circled, every\nsweep a torturous blessing.\n\u201cHunt.\u201d She didn\u2019t know if his name was a plea or a question.\nHe just tugged aside her underwear and put his fingers directly on her.\nShe moaned again, and Hunt stroked her, two fingers dragging up and\ndown with teeth-grinding lightness. He licked up the side of her throat,\nfingers playing mercilessly with her. He whispered against her skin, \u201cDo\nyou taste as good as you feel, Bryce?\u201d\n\u201cPlease find out immediately,\u201d she managed to gasp.\nHis laugh rumbled through her, but his fingers didn\u2019t halt their\nleisurely exploration. \u201cNot yet, Quinlan.\u201d\nOne of his fingers found her entrance and lingered, circling. \u201cDo it,\u201d\nshe said. If she didn\u2019t feel him inside her\u2014his fingers or his cock, anything\n\u2014she might start begging.\n\u201cSo bossy,\u201d Hunt purred against her neck, then claimed her mouth\nagain. And as his lips settled over hers, nipping and taunting, he slid that\nfinger deep into her.\nBoth of them groaned. \u201cFuck, Bryce,\u201d he said again. \u201cFuck.\u201d\nHer eyes nearly rolled back into her head at the feeling of that finger.\nShe rocked her hips, desperate to drive him deeper, and he obliged her,\npulling out his finger nearly all the way, adding a second, and plunging both\nback into her.\nShe bucked, her nails digging into his chest. His thunderous heartbeat\nraged against her palms. She buried her face in his neck, biting and licking,\nstarving for any taste of him while he pumped his hand into her again.\nHunt breathed into her ear, \u201cI am going to fuck you until you can\u2019t\nremember your gods-damned name.\u201d\nGods, yes. \u201cLikewise,\u201d she croaked.\nRelease shimmered in her, a wild and reckless song, and she rode his\nhand toward it. His other hand cupped her backside. \u201cDon\u2019t think I\u2019ve\nforgotten this particular asset,\u201d he murmured, squeezing for emphasis. \u201cI\nhave plans for this beautiful ass, Bryce. Filthy, filthy plans.\u201d\nShe moaned again, and his fingers stroked into her, over and over.\n\u201cCome for me, sweetheart,\u201d he purred against her breast, his tongue\nflicking over her nipple just as one of his fingers curled inside her, hitting\nthat gods-damned spot.\nBryce did. Hunt\u2019s name on her lips, she tipped her head back and let\ngo, riding his hand with abandon, driving them both into the couch\ncushions.\nHe groaned, and she swallowed the sound with an openmouthed kiss\nas every nerve in her body exploded into glorious starlight.\nThen there was only breathing, and him\u2014his body, his scent, that\nstrength.\nThe starlight receded, and she opened her eyes to find him with his\nhead tipped back, teeth bared.\nNot in pleasure. In pain.\nShe\u2019d driven him into the cushions. Shoved his wounded back right up\nagainst the couch.\nHorror lurched through her like ice water, dousing any heat in her\nveins. \u201cOh gods. I am so sorry\u2014\u201d\nHe cracked his eyes open. That groan he\u2019d made as she came had been\npain, and she\u2019d been so fucking wild for him that she hadn\u2019t noticed\u2014\n\u201cAre you hurt?\u201d she demanded, hoisting herself up from his lap,\nreaching to remove his fingers, still deep inside her.\nHe halted her with his other hand on her wrist. \u201cI\u2019ll survive.\u201d His eyes\ndarkened as he looked at her bare breasts, still inches from his mouth. The\ndress shoved halfway down her body. \u201cI have other things to distract me,\u201d\nhe murmured, leaning down for her peaked nipple.\nOr trying to. A grimace passed over his face.\n\u201cDark Hel, Hunt,\u201d she barked, yanking out of his grip, off his fingers,\nnearly falling from his lap. He didn\u2019t even fight her as she grabbed his\nshoulder and peered at his back.\nFresh blood leaked through his bandages.\n\u201cAre you out of your mind?\u201d she shouted, searching for anything in the\nimmediate vicinity to press against the blood. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d\n\u201cAs you like to say,\u201d he panted, shaking slightly, \u201cit\u2019s my body. I\ndecide its limits.\u201d\nShe reined in the urge to strangle him, grabbing for her phone. \u201cI\u2019m\ncalling a medwitch.\u201d\nHe gripped her wrist again. \u201cWe\u2019re not done here.\u201d\n\u201cOh yes we fucking are,\u201d she seethed. \u201cI\u2019m not having sex with you\nwhen you\u2019re spouting blood like a fountain.\u201d An exaggeration, but still.\nHis eyes were dark\u2014burning. So Bryce poked his back, a good six\ninches beneath his wound. His answering wince of pain settled the\nargument.\nSetting her underwear to rights and sliding her dress back over her\nchest and arms, she dialed the public medwitch number.\nThe medwitch arrived and was gone within an hour. Hunt\u2019s wound was\nfine, she\u2019d declared, to Bryce\u2019s knee-wobbling relief.\nThen Hunt had the nerve to ask if he was cleared for sex.\nThe witch, to her credit, didn\u2019t laugh. Just said, When you\u2019re able to fly\nagain, then I\u2019d say it\u2019s safe for you to be sexually active as well. She nodded\ntoward the couch cushions\u2014the bloodstain that would require a magi-spell\nto erase. I\u2019d suggest whatever \u2026 interaction caused tonight\u2019s injury also be\npostponed until your wings are healed.\nHunt had looked ready to argue, but Bryce had hurried the witch out of\nthe apartment. And then helped him to his bed. For all his questions, he\nswayed with each step. Nearly collapsed onto his bed. He answered a few\nmessages on his phone, and was asleep before she\u2019d shut off the lights.\nCleared for sex, indeed.\nBryce slept heavily in her own bed, despite what she\u2019d learned and\nseen about the synth.\nBut she woke at three. And knew what she had to do.\nShe fired off an email with her request, and regardless of the late hour,\nreceived one back within twenty minutes: she\u2019d need to wait until her\nrequest was approved by the 33rd. Bryce frowned. She didn\u2019t have time for\nthat.\nShe crept from her room. Hunt\u2019s door was shut, his room dark beyond\nit. He didn\u2019t so much as come to investigate as she slipped out of the\napartment.\nAnd headed for her old one.\nShe hadn\u2019t been on this block in two years.\nBut as she rounded the corner and saw the flashing lights and terrified\ncrowds, she knew.\nKnew what building burned midway down the block.\nSomeone must have noticed that she\u2019d logged on to Danika\u2019s account\nat Redner Industries today. Or perhaps someone had been monitoring her\nemail account\u2014and seen the message she\u2019d sent to the building\u2019s landlord.\nWhoever had done this must have acted quickly, realizing that she\u2019d wanted\nto come hunt for any other clues Danika might have left around the\napartment.\nThere had to be more. Danika was smart enough to not have put\neverything she\u2019d discovered in one place.\nTerrified, weeping people\u2014her old neighbors\u2014had clustered on the\nstreet, hugging each other and gazing up at the blaze in disbelief. Fire licked\nat every windowsill.\nShe\u2019d done this\u2014brought this upon the people watching their homes\nburn. Her chest tightened, the pain barely eased by overhearing a passing\nwater nymph announce to her firefighting squad that every resident was\naccounted for.\nShe had caused this.\nBut\u2014it meant she was getting close. Look toward where it hurts the\nmost, the Viper Queen had advised her all those weeks ago. She\u2019d thought\nthe shifter meant what hurt her. But maybe it had been about the murderer\nall along.\nAnd by circling in on the synth \u2026 Apparently, she\u2019d hit a nerve.\nBryce was halfway home when her phone buzzed. She pulled it from\nher hastily repaired jacket, the white opal in the pocket clinking against the\nscreen, already bracing herself for Hunt\u2019s questions.\nBut it was from Tharion.\nThere\u2019s a deal going down on the river right now. A boat is out there,\nsignaling. Just past the Black Dock. Be there in five and I can get you out to\nsee it.\nShe clenched the white opal in her fist and wrote back, A synth deal?\nTharion answered, No, a cotton candy deal.\nShe rolled her eyes. I\u2019ll be there in three.\nAnd then she broke into a run. She didn\u2019t call Hunt. Or Ruhn.\nShe knew what they\u2019d say. Do not fucking go there without me, Bryce.\nWait.\nBut she didn\u2019t have time to waste."}, "65": {"Name": "PART III THE CANYON-Chapter 65", "Page Content": " 5 \nBryce gripped Tharion\u2019s waist so hard it was a wonder he didn\u2019t have\ndifficulty breathing. Beneath them, the wave skimmer bobbed on the river\u2019s\ncurrent. Only the occasional passing glow under the dark surface indicated\nthat there was anything or anyone around them.\nShe\u2019d hesitated when the mer arrived at the pier, the matte black wave\nskimmer idling. It\u2019s either this or swimming, Legs, he\u2019d informed her.\nShe\u2019d opted for the wave skimmer, but had spent the last five minutes\nregretting it.\n\u201cUp there,\u201d the mer male murmured, cutting the already quiet engine.\nIt must have been a stealth vehicle from the River Queen\u2019s stash. Or\nTharion\u2019s own, as her Captain of Intelligence.\nBryce beheld the small barge idling on the river. Mist drifted around\nthem, turning the few firstlights on the barge into bobbing orbs.\n\u201cI count six people,\u201d Tharion observed.\nShe peered into the gloom ahead. \u201cI can\u2019t make out what they are.\nHumanoid shapes.\u201d\nTharion\u2019s body hummed, and the wave skimmer drifted forward,\ncarried on a current of his own making.\n\u201cNeat trick,\u201d she murmured.\n\u201cIt always gets the ladies,\u201d he muttered back.\nBryce might have chuckled had they not neared the barge. \u201cKeep\ndownwind so they can\u2019t scent us.\u201d\n\u201cI know how to remain unseen, Legs.\u201d But he obeyed her.\nThe people on the boat were hooded against the misting rain, but as\nthey drifted closer\u2014\n\u201cIt\u2019s the Viper Queen,\u201d Bryce said, her voice hushed. No one else in\nthis city would have the swagger to wear that ridiculous purple raincoat.\n\u201cLying asshole. She said she didn\u2019t deal in synth.\u201d\n\u201cNo surprise,\u201d Tharion growled. \u201cShe\u2019s always up to shady shit.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but is she buying or selling this time?\u201d\n\u201cOnly one way to find out.\u201d\nThey drifted closer. The barge, they realized, was painted with a pair\nof snake eyes. And the crates piled on the rear of the barge \u2026 \u201cSelling,\u201d\nTharion observed. He jerked his chin to a tall figure facing the Viper Queen,\napparently in a heated discussion with someone beside them. \u201cThose are the\nbuyers.\u201d A nod to the person half-hidden in the shadows, arguing with the\ntall figure. \u201cDisagreeing about what it\u2019s worth, probably.\u201d\nThe Viper Queen was selling synth. Had it really been her this entire\ntime? Behind Danika and the pack\u2019s deaths, too, despite that alibi? Or had\nshe merely gotten her hands on the substance once it leaked from the lab?\nThe arguing buyer shook their head with clear disgust. But their\nassociate seemed to ignore whatever was said and chucked the Viper Queen\nwhat looked like a dark sack. She peered inside, and pulled something out.\nGold flashed in the mist.\n\u201cThat is a fuck-ton of money,\u201d Tharion murmured. \u201cEnough for that\nentire shipment, I bet.\u201d\n\u201cCan you get closer so we can hear?\u201d\nTharion nodded, and they drifted again. The barge loomed, the\nattention of all aboard fixed on the deal going down rather than the shadows\nbeyond it.\nThe Viper Queen was saying to them, \u201cI think you\u2019ll find this to be\nsufficient for your goals.\u201d\nBryce knew she should call Hunt and Ruhn and get every legionary\nand Aux member over here to shut this down before more synth flooded the\nstreets or wound up in worse hands. In the hands of fanatics like Philip\nBriggs and his ilk.\nShe pulled her phone from her jacket pocket, flicking a button to keep\nthe screen from lighting up. A push of another button had the camera\nfunction appearing. She snapped a few photos of the boat, the Viper Queen,\nand the tall, dark figure she faced. Human, shifter, or Fae, she couldn\u2019t tell\nwith the jacket and hood.\nBryce pulled up Hunt\u2019s number.\nThe Viper Queen said to the buyers, \u201cI think this is the start of a\nbeautiful friendship, don\u2019t you?\u201d\nThe tallest buyer didn\u2019t reply. Just stiffly turned back to their\ncompanions, displeasure written in every movement as the firstlights\nilluminated the face beneath the hood.\n\u201cHoly fuck,\u201d Tharion whispered.\nEvery thought eddied out of Bryce\u2019s head.\nThere was nothing left in her but roaring silence as Hunt\u2019s face became\nclear."}, "66": {"Name": "PART III THE CANYON-Chapter 66", "Page Content": " 6 \nBryce didn\u2019t know how she wound up on the barge. What she said to\nTharion to make him pull up. How she climbed off the wave skimmer and\nonto the boat itself.\nBut it happened fast. Fast enough that Hunt had made it only three\nsteps before Bryce was there, soaked and wondering if she\u2019d puke.\nGuns clicked, pointing at her. She didn\u2019t see them.\nShe only saw Hunt whirl toward her, his eyes wide.\nOf course she hadn\u2019t recognized him from a distance. He had no\nwings. But the powerful build, the height, the angle of his head \u2026 That was\nall him.\nAnd his colleague behind him, the one who\u2019d handed over the money\n\u2014Viktoria. Justinian emerged from the shadows beyond them, his wings\npainted black to conceal them in the moonlight.\nBryce was distantly aware of Tharion behind her, telling the Viper\nQueen that she was under arrest on behalf of the River Queen. Distantly\naware of the Viper Queen chuckling.\nBut all she heard was Hunt breathe, \u201cBryce.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the fuck is this?\u201d she whispered. Rain slashed her face. She\ncouldn\u2019t hear, couldn\u2019t get any air down, couldn\u2019t think as she said again,\nher voice breaking, \u201cWhat the fuck is this, Hunt?\u201d\n\u201cIt is exactly what it looks like,\u201d a cold, deep voice said behind her.\nIn a storm of white wings, Micah emerged from the mists and landed,\nflanked by Isaiah, Naomi, and six other angels, all armed to the teeth and in\nlegion black. But they made no move to incapacitate the Viper Queen or her\ncronies.\nNo, they all faced Hunt and his companions. Aimed their guns toward\nthem.\nHunt looked at the Governor\u2014then at the Viper Queen. He snarled\nsoftly, \u201cYou fucking bitch.\u201d\nThe Viper Queen chuckled. She said to Micah, \u201cYou owe me a favor\nnow, Governor.\u201d\nMicah jerked his chin in confirmation.\nViktoria hissed at her, halo crinkling on her brow, \u201cYou set us up.\u201d\nThe Viper Queen crossed her arms. \u201cI knew it would be worth my\nwhile to see who came sniffing around for this shit when word leaked that I\ngot my hands on a shipment,\u201d she said, motioning toward the synth. Her\nsmile was pure poison as she looked at Hunt. \u201cI was hoping it\u2019d be you,\nUmbra Mortis.\u201d\nBryce\u2019s heart thundered. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\nHunt pivoted to her, his face bleak in the floodlights. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t\nsupposed to go down like this, Bryce. Maybe at first, but I saw that video\ntonight and I tried to stop it, stop them, but they wouldn\u2019t fucking listen\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThese three thought synth would be an easy way to regain what was\ntaken from them,\u201d the Viper Queen said. A vicious pause. \u201cThe power to\noverthrow their masters.\u201d\nThe world shifted beneath her. Bryce said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d\nBut the flicker of pain in Hunt\u2019s eyes told her that her blind, stupid\nfaith in his innocence had gutted him.\n\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d Micah said, his voice like ice. \u201cThese three learned of the\nsynth days ago, and have since been seeking a way to purchase it\u2014and to\ndistribute it among their fellow would-be rebels. To attain its powers long\nenough to break their halos, and finish what Shahar started on Mount\nHermon.\u201d He nodded toward the Viper Queen. \u201cShe was gracious enough to\ninform me of this plan, after Justinian tried to recruit a female under her \u2026\ninfluence.\u201d\nBryce shook her head. She was trembling so hard that Tharion gripped\nher around the waist.\n\u201cI told you I\u2019d figure out your asking price, Athalar,\u201d the Viper Queen\nsaid.\nBryce began crying. She hated every tear, every shuddering, stupid\ngasp. Hated the pain in Hunt\u2019s eyes as he stared at her, only her, and said,\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nBut Bryce just asked, \u201cDays ago?\u201d\nSilence.\nShe said again, \u201cYou knew about the synth days ago?\u201d\nHer heart\u2014it was her stupid fucking heart that was cracking and\ncracking and cracking \u2026\nHunt said, \u201cMicah assigned me some targets. Three drug lords. They\ntold me that two years ago, a small amount of synth leaked from the Redner\nlab and onto the streets. But it ran out fast\u2014too fast. They said that finally,\nafter two years of trying to replicate it, someone had figured out the formula\nat last, and it was now being made\u2014and would be capable of amping up\nour power. I didn\u2019t think it had anything to do with the case\u2014not until\nrecently. I didn\u2019t know the truth of what the Hel it could even do until I saw\nthat footage of the trials.\u201d\n\u201cHow.\u201d Her word cut through the rain. \u201cHow did it leak?\u201d\nHunt shook his head. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\nMicah said coldly, \u201cDanika Fendyr.\u201d\nBryce backed up a step, into Tharion\u2019s grip. \u201cThat\u2019s not possible.\u201d\nHunt said with a gentleness that decimated her, \u201cDanika sold it, Bryce.\nIt\u2019s why she was spotted on that boat with the crate of it. I figured it out\nnearly a week ago. She stole the formula for it, sold the stock, and\u2014\u201d He\nstopped himself.\n\u201cAnd what?\u201d Bryce whispered. \u201cAnd what, Hunt?\u201d\n\u201cAnd Danika used it herself. Was addicted to it.\u201d\nShe was going to be sick. \u201cDanika would never have done that. She\nnever would have done any of this.\u201d\nHunt shook his head. \u201cShe did, Bryce.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nWhen Micah didn\u2019t interrupt them, Hunt said, \u201cLook at the evidence.\u201d\nHis voice was sharp as knives. \u201cLook at the last messages between you. The\ndrugs we found in your system that night\u2014that was standard shit for you\ntwo. So what was one more kind of drug? One that in small doses could\ngive an even more intense high? One that could take the edge off for Danika\nafter a long day, after Sabine had ripped her apart yet again? One that gave\nher a taste of what it\u2019d be like to be Prime of the wolves, gave her that\npower, since she was waiting to make the Drop with you?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nHunt\u2019s voice cracked. \u201cShe took it, Bryce. All signs point to her killing\nthose two CCU students the night the Horn was stolen. They saw her\nstealing the Horn and she chased them down and killed them.\u201d\nBryce remembered Danika\u2019s pallor when she\u2019d told her about the\nstudents\u2019 deaths, her haunted eyes.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not true.\u201d\nHunt shook his head. As if he could undo it, unlearn it. \u201cThose drug\nlords I killed said Danika was seen around the Meat Market. Talking about\nsynth. It was how Danika knew Maximus Tertian\u2014he was an addict like\nher. His girlfriend had no idea.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nBut Hunt looked to Micah. \u201cI assume we\u2019re going now.\u201d He held out\nhis wrists. For cuffs. Indeed, those were gorsian stones\u2014thick, magic-\nkilling manacles\u2014gleaming in Isaiah\u2019s hands.\nThe Archangel said, \u201cAren\u2019t you going to tell her the rest?\u201d\nHunt stilled. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessary. Let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\u201cTell me what,\u201d Bryce whispered. Tharion\u2019s hands tightened on her\narms in warning.\n\u201cThat he already knows the truth about Danika\u2019s murder,\u201d the\nArchangel said coldly. Bored. As if he\u2019d done this a thousand times, in a\nthousand variations. As if he\u2019d already guessed.\nBryce looked at Hunt and saw it in his eyes. She began shaking her\nhead, weeping. \u201cNo.\u201d\nHunt said, \u201cDanika took the synth the night she died. Took too much\nof it. It drove her out of her mind. She slaughtered her own pack. And then\nherself.\u201d\nOnly Tharion\u2019s grip was keeping her upright. \u201cNo, no, no\u2014\u201d\nHunt said, \u201cIt\u2019s why there was never any audio of the killer, Bryce.\u201d\n\u201cShe was begging for her life\u2014\u201d\n\u201cShe was begging herself to stop,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cThe only snarls on the\nrecording were hers.\u201d\nDanika. Danika had killed the pack. Killed Thorne. Killed Connor.\nAnd then ripped herself to shreds.\n\u201cBut the Horn\u2014\u201d\n\u201cShe must have stolen it just to piss off Sabine. And then probably sold\nit on the black market. It had nothing to do with any of this. It was always\nabout the synth for her.\u201d\nMicah cut in, \u201cI have it on good authority that Danika stole footage of\nthe synth trials from Redner\u2019s lab.\u201d\n\u201cBut the kristallos\u2014\u201d\n\u201cA side effect of the synth, when used in high doses,\u201d Micah said.\n\u201cThe surge of powerful magic it grants the user also brings the ability to\nopen portals, thanks to the obsidian salt in its formula. Danika did just that,\naccidentally summoning the kristallos. The black salt in the synth can have\na mind of its own. A sentience. Its measurement in the synth\u2019s formula\nmatches the unholy number of the kristallos. With high doses of synth, the\npower of the salt gains control and can summon the kristallos. That\u2019s why\nwe\u2019ve been seeing them recently\u2014the drug is on the streets now, in doses\noften higher than recommended. Like you suspected, the kristallos feeds on\nvital organs, using the sewers to deposit bodies into the waterway. The two\nrecent murder victims\u2014the acolyte and the temple guard\u2014were the\nunfortunate victims of someone high on the synth.\u201d\nSilence fell again. And Bryce turned once more to Hunt. \u201cYou knew.\u201d\nHe held her stare. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nHer voice rose to a scream. \u201cYou knew!\u201d\nHunt lunged\u2014one step toward her.\nA gun gleamed in the dark, pressed against his head, and halted him in\nhis tracks.\nBryce knew that handgun. The engraved silver wings on the black\nbarrel.\n\u201cYou move, angel, and you fucking die.\u201d\nHunt held up his hands. But his eyes did not leave Bryce as Fury Axtar\nemerged from the shadows beyond the crates of synth.\nBryce didn\u2019t question how Fury had arrived without even Micah\nnoticing or how she knew to come. Fury Axtar was liquid night\u2014she\u2019d\nmade herself infamous for knowing the world\u2019s secrets.\nFury edged around Hunt, backing up to Bryce\u2019s side. She pocketed the\ngun in the holster at her thigh, her usual skintight black suit gleaming with\nrain and her chin-length black hair dripping with it, but said to the Viper\nQueen, \u201cGet the fuck out of my sight.\u201d\nA sly smile. \u201cIt\u2019s my boat.\u201d\n\u201cThen go somewhere I can\u2019t see your face.\u201d\nBryce didn\u2019t have it in her to be shocked that the Viper Queen obeyed\nFury\u2019s order.\nDidn\u2019t have it in her to do anything but stare at Hunt. \u201cYou knew,\u201d she\nsaid again.\nHunt\u2019s eyes scanned hers. \u201cI never wanted you to be hurt. I never\nwanted you to know\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou knew, you knew, you knew!\u201d He\u2019d figured out the truth, and for\nnearly a week, he\u2019d said nothing to her. Had let her go on and on about how\nmuch she loved her friend, how great Danika had been, and had led her in\nfucking circles. \u201cAll your talk about the synth being a waste of my time to\nlook into \u2026\u201d She could barely get the words out. \u201cBecause you realized the\ntruth already. Because you lied.\u201d She threw out an arm to the crates of\ndrugs. \u201cBecause you learned the truth and then realized you wanted the\nsynth for yourself? And when you wanted to help the medwitch find an\nantidote \u2026 It was for yourself. And all of this for what\u2014to rebel again?\u201d\nHunt slid to his knees, as if he\u2019d beg her forgiveness. \u201cAt first, yes, but\nit was all just based on a rumor of what it could do. Then tonight I saw that\nfootage you found, and I wanted to pull out from the deal. I knew it wasn\u2019t\nright\u2014any of it. Even with the antidote, it was too dangerous. I realized all\nthis was the wrong path. But you and me, Bryce \u2026 You are where I want to\nend up. A life\u2014with you. You are my fucking path.\u201d He pointed to Justinian\nand Viktoria, stone-faced and handcuffed. \u201cI messaged them that it was\nover, but they got spooked, contacted the Viper Queen, and insisted it was\ngoing down tonight.

The same as those\naround Viktoria\u2019s and Justinian\u2019s wrists.\nBryce couldn\u2019t stop shaking as she leaned back into Tharion, Fury a\nsilent force beside her.\n\u201cBryce, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Hunt said as a grim-looking Isaiah clapped the\nshackles on him. \u201cI couldn\u2019t bear the thought of you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d Fury said. \u201cYou\u2019ve said and done enough.\u201d She\nlooked to Micah. \u201cShe\u2019s done with you. All of you.\u201d She tugged Bryce\ntoward her wave skimmer idling beside Tharion\u2019s, the mer male guarding\ntheir backs. \u201cYou bother her again and I\u2019ll pay you a visit, Governor.\u201d\nBryce didn\u2019t notice as she was eased onto the wave skimmer. As Fury\ngot on in front of her and gunned the engine. As Tharion slipped onto his\nand trailed, to guard the way back to shore.\n\u201cBryce,\u201d Hunt tried again as she wrapped her arms around Fury\u2019s tiny\nwaist. \u201cYour heart was already so broken, and the last thing I ever wanted to\ndo was\u2014\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t look back at him as the wind whipped her hair and the wave\nskimmer launched into the rain and darkness.\n\u201cBRYCE!\u201d Hunt roared.\nShe didn\u2019t look back."}, "67": {"Name": "PART III THE CANYON-Chapter 67", "Page Content": " 7 \nRuhn was in the apartment lobby when Fury dropped her off. Tharion left\nthem at the docks, saying he was going to help haul in the seized synth\nshipment, and Fury departed fast enough that Bryce knew she was heading\nout to make sure the Viper Queen didn\u2019t abscond with any of it, either.\nRuhn said nothing as they rode the elevator.\nBut she knew Fury had told him. Summoned him here.\nHer friend had been messaging someone on the walk back from the\ndocks. And she\u2019d spied Flynn and Declan standing guard on the rooftops of\nher block, armed with their long-range rifles.\nHer brother didn\u2019t speak until they were in the apartment, the place\ndark and hollow and foreign. Every piece of clothing and gear belonging to\nHunt was like an asp, ready to strike. That bloodstain on the couch was the\nworst of all.\nBryce made it halfway across the great room before she puked all over\nthe carpet.\nRuhn was instantly there, his arms and shadows around her.\nShe could feel her sobs, hear them, but they were distant.

It couldn\u2019t be true.\nNo better than a bunch of drug addicts. That\u2019s what Hunt had implied.\nShe and Danika had been no better than two addicts, inhaling and snorting\neverything they could get their hands on.\nIt wasn\u2019t like that. Hadn\u2019t ever been like that. It had been stupid, but it\nhad been for fun, for distraction and release, never for something dark\u2014\nShe was shaking so hard she thought her bones might snap.\nRuhn\u2019s grip on her tightened, like he could keep her together.\nHunt must have known she was getting close to learning the truth\nwhen she\u2019d shown him the trial videos. So he\u2019d spun her lies about a happy\nending for the two of them, a future for them, had distracted her with his\nmouth and hands. And then, as one of the triarii, he\u2019d gotten the alert from\nher old landlord about her request to visit the apartment\u2014and snuck out,\nletting her think he was asleep. A bolt of his lightning had probably sparked\nthe flame.\nShe remembered the water nymph saying that there hadn\u2019t been any\ncasualties\u2014had some shred of decency in Hunt made him trigger the fire\nalarms in an attempt to warn people? She had to believe it.\nBut once Hunt had burned the building down so there was no hint of\nevidence left, he\u2019d met with the Viper Queen to barter for what he needed to\nfuel his rebellion. She didn\u2019t believe his bullshit about pulling out of the\ndeal. Not for a heartbeat. He knew the world of hurt about to come down on\nhim. He\u2019d have said anything.\nDanika had killed the Pack of Devils. Killed Thorne and Connor. And\nthen herself.\nAnd now Danika lived on, in shame, among the mausoleums of the\nSleeping City.

He\u2019ll be dead soon enough if he\u2019s lucky.\nWhat about the wraith?\nMicah ripped her from her body and shoved her essence into a glass\nbox. Put it at the base of Justinian\u2019s crucifix.

You can\u2019t do anything?\nThey\u2019re traitors to the Republic. They were caught conspiring against\nit. So, no.\nBut Athalar\u2019s not crucified beside Justinian?\nI think Micah came up with a different punishment for him. Something\nworse.\nWhat could be worse than what the other two are enduring?\nA long, horrible pause. A lot of things, Ruhn Danaan.\nBryce let the words wash over her.

And stared into the black pit inside herself.\nPART IV\nTHE RAVINE"}, "68": {"Name": "PART IV THE RAVINE-Chapter 68", "Page Content": " 8 \nFor some reason, Hunt had expected a stone dungeon.\nHe didn\u2019t know why, since he\u2019d been in these holding cells beneath the\nComitium countless times to deposit the few enemies Micah wanted left\nalive, but he\u2019d somehow pictured his capture to be the mirror of what had\ngone down in Pangera: the dark, filthy dungeons of the Asteri, the ones that\nwere so similar in Sandriel\u2019s palace.\nNot this white cell, the chrome bars humming with magic to nullify his\nown. A screen on the wall of the hallway showed a feed of the Comitium\natrium: the one body spiked to the iron crucifix in its center, and the glass\nbox, covered in dripping blood, sitting at its feet.\nJustinian still groaned every now and then, his toes or fingers\ntwitching as he slowly asphyxiated, his body trying and failing to heal his\ntaxed lungs. His wings had already been cut off. Left on the marble floor\nbeneath him.\nViktoria, her essence invisible within that glass box, was forced to\nwatch. To endure Justinian\u2019s blood dripping on the lid of her container.\nHunt had sat on the small cot and watched every second of what had\nbeen done to them. How Viktoria had screamed while Micah ripped her\nfrom that body she\u2019d been trapped in for so long. How Justinian had fought,\neven as they held down his brutalized body on the crucifix, even as the iron\nspikes went into him. Even as they raised the crucifix, and he\u2019d begun\nscreaming at the pain.\nA door clanged open down the hallway. Hunt didn\u2019t rise from the cot\nto see who approached. The wound on his temple had healed, but he hadn\u2019t\nbothered to wash away the blood streaking down his cheek and jaw.\nThe footsteps down the hall were steady, unhurried. Isaiah.\nHunt remained seated as his old companion paused before the bars.\n\u201cWhy.\u201d There was nothing charming, nothing warm on the handsome\nface. Just anger, exhaustion, and fear.\nHunt said, aware of every camera and not caring, \u201cBecause it has to\nstop at some point.\u201d\n\u201cIt stops when you\u2019re dead. When everyone we love is dead.\u201d Isaiah\npointed to the screen behind him, to Justinian\u2019s ravaged body and Viktoria\u2019s\nblood-soaked box. \u201cDoes this make you feel like you\u2019re on the right path,\nHunt? Was this worth it?\u201d\nWhen he\u2019d gotten Justinian\u2019s message that the deal was going down,\nas he climbed into bed, he\u2019d realized it wasn\u2019t worth it. Not even with the\nmedwitch\u2019s antidote. Not after these weeks with Bryce. Not after what\nthey\u2019d done on that couch. But Hunt said, because it was still true,\n\u201cNothing\u2019s changed since Mount Hermon, Isaiah. Nothing has gotten\nbetter.\u201d\n\u201cHow long have you three been planning this shit?\u201d\n\u201cSince I killed those three drug lords. Since they told me about the\nsynth and what it could do. Since they told me what kind of power it gave\nDanika Fendyr when she took it in the right doses. We decided it was time.\nNo more fucking bargains with Micah. No more deaths for deaths. Just the\nones we choose.\u201d\nThe three of them had known there was one place, one person, who\nmight get the synth. He\u2019d paid the Viper Queen a private visit a few days\nago. Had found her in her den of poisons and told her what he wanted. Vik\nhad the gold, thanks to the paychecks she\u2019d saved up for centuries.\nIt hadn\u2019t occurred to him that the snake would be in the Archangel\u2019s\npocket. Or looking for a way into it.\nIsaiah shook his head. \u201cAnd you thought that you, you and Vik and\nJustinian and whatever idiots would follow you, could take the synth and do\nwhat? Kill Micah? Sandriel? All of them?\u201d\n\u201cThat was the idea.\u201d They\u2019d planned to do it at the Summit. And\nafterward, they\u2019d make their way to Pangera. To the Eternal City. And finish\nwhat was started so long ago.\n\u201cWhat if it turned on you\u2014what if you took too much and ripped\nyourself to shreds instead?\u201d\n\u201cI was working on getting my hands on an antidote.\u201d Hunt shrugged.\n\u201cBut I\u2019ve already confessed to everything, so spare me the interrogation.\u201d\nIsaiah banged a hand on the cell bars. Wind howled in the corridor\naround him. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have let it go, couldn\u2019t serve and prove yourself\nand\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI tried to stop it, for fuck\u2019s sake. I was on that barge because I realized\n\u2026\u201d He shook his head. \u201cIt makes no difference at this point. But I did try. I\nsaw that footage of what it really did to someone who took it, and even with\nan antidote, it was too fucking dangerous. But Justinian and Vik refused to\nquit. By the time Vik gave the Viper Queen the gold, I just wanted us to go\nour separate ways.\u201d\nIsaiah shook his head in disgust.\nHunt spat, \u201cYou might be able to accept the bit in your mouth, but I\nnever will.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Isaiah hissed. \u201cBut I have a reason to work for my freedom,\nHunt.\u201d A flash of his eyes. \u201cI thought you did, too.\u201d\nHunt\u2019s stomach twisted. \u201cBryce had nothing to do with this.\u201d\n\u201cOf course she didn\u2019t. You shattered her fucking heart in front of\neveryone. It was obvious she had no idea.\u201d\nHunt flinched, his chest aching. \u201cMicah won\u2019t go after her to\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo. You\u2019re lucky as fuck, but no. He won\u2019t crucify her to punish you.\nThough don\u2019t be na\u00efve enough to believe the thought didn\u2019t cross his\nmind.\u201d\nHunt couldn\u2019t stop his shudder of relief.\nIsaiah said, \u201cMicah knows that you tried to stop the deal. Saw the\nmessages between you and Justinian about it. That\u2019s why they\u2019re in the\nlobby right now and you\u2019re here.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s he going to do with me?\u201d\n\u201cHe hasn\u2019t declared it yet.\u201d His face softened slightly. \u201cI came down to\nsay goodbye. Just in case we can\u2019t later on.\u201d\nHunt nodded. He\u2019d accepted his fate. He\u2019d tried, and failed, and would\npay the price. Again.\nIt was a better end than the slow death of his soul as he took one life\nafter another for Micah. \u201cTell her I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cPlease.\u201d\nAt the end of the day, despite Vik and Justinian, despite the brutal end\nthat would come his way, it was the sight of Bryce\u2019s face that haunted him.\nThe sight of the tears he\u2019d caused.\nHe\u2019d promised her a future and then brought that pain and despair and\nsorrow to her face. He\u2019d never hated himself more.\nIsaiah\u2019s fingers lifted toward the bars, as if he\u2019d reach for Hunt\u2019s hand,\nbut then lowered back to his side. \u201cI will.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s been three days,\u201d Lehabah said. \u201cAnd the Governor hasn\u2019t announced\nwhat he\u2019s doing with Athie.\u201d\nBryce looked up from the book she was reading in the library. \u201cTurn\noff that television.\u201d\nLehabah did no such thing, her glowing face fixed on the tablet\u2019s\nscreen. The news footage of the Comitium lobby and the now-rotting corpse\nof the triarii soldier crucified there. The blood-crusted glass box beneath it.\nDespite the endless bullshitting by the news anchors and analysts, no\ninformation had leaked regarding why two of Micah\u2019s top soldiers had been\nso brutally executed. A failed coup was all that had been suggested. No\nmention of Hunt. Whether he lived.\n\u201cHe\u2019s alive,\u201d Lehabah whispered. \u201cI know he is. I can feel it.\u201d\nBryce ran a finger over a line of text. It was the tenth time she\u2019d\nattempted to read it in the twenty minutes since the messenger had left,\ndropping off a vial of the antidote from the medwitch who\u2019d taken the\nkristallos venom from her leg. Apparently, she\u2019d found the way to make the\nantidote work without her being present. But Bryce didn\u2019t marvel. Not\nwhen the vial was just a silent reminder of what she and Hunt had shared\nthat day.\nShe\u2019d debated throwing it out, but had opted to lock the antidote in the\nsafe in Jesiba\u2019s office, right next to that six-inch golden bullet for the\nGodslayer Rifle. Life and death, salvation and destruction, now entombed\nthere together.\n\u201cViolet Kappel said on the morning news that there might be more\nwould-be rebels\u2014\u201d\n\u201cTurn off that screen, Lehabah, before I throw it in the fucking tank.\u201d\nHer sharp words cut through the library. The rustling creatures in their\ncages stilled. Even Syrinx stirred from his nap.\nLehabah dimmed to a faint pink. \u201cAre you sure there\u2019s nothing we can\n\u2014\u201d\nBryce slammed the book shut and hauled it with her, aiming for the\nstairs.\nShe didn\u2019t hear Lehabah\u2019s next words over the front door\u2019s buzzer.\nWork had proved busier than usual, a grand total of six shoppers wasting\nher time asking about shit they had no interest in buying. If she had to deal\nwith one more idiot today\u2014\nShe glanced at the monitors. And froze.\nThe Autumn King surveyed the gallery, the showroom stocked with\npriceless artifacts, the door that led up to Jesiba\u2019s office and the window in\nit that overlooked the floor. He stared at the window for long enough that\nBryce wondered if he could somehow see through the one-way glass, all the\nway to the Godslayer Rifle mounted on the wall behind Jesiba\u2019s desk. Sense\nits deadly presence, and that of the golden bullet in the wall safe beside it.\nBut his eyes drifted on, to the iron door sealed to her right, and finally,\nfinally to Bryce herself.\nHe\u2019d never come to see her. In all these years, he\u2019d never come. Why\nbother?\n\u201cThere are cameras everywhere,\u201d she said, staying seated behind her\ndesk, hating every whiff of his ashes-and-nutmeg scent that dragged her\nback twelve years, to the weeping thirteen-year-old she\u2019d been the last time\nshe\u2019d spoken to him. \u201cIn case you\u2019re thinking of stealing something.\u201d\nHe ignored the taunt and slid his hands into the pockets of his black\njeans, still conducting his silent survey of the gallery. He was gorgeous, her\nfather. Tall, muscled, with an impossibly beautiful face beneath that long\nred hair, the exact same shade and silken texture as her own. He looked just\na few years older than her, too\u2014dressed like a young man, with those black\njeans and a matching long-sleeved T-shirt. But his amber eyes were ancient\nand cruel as he said at last, \u201cMy son told me what occurred on the river on\nWednesday night.\u201d\nHow he managed to make that slight emphasis on my son into an insult\nwas beyond her.\n\u201cRuhn is a good dog.\u201d\n\u201cPrince Ruhn deemed it necessary that I know, since you might be \u2026\nin peril.\u201d\n\u201cAnd yet you waited three days? Were you hoping I\u2019d be crucified,\ntoo?\u201d\nHer father\u2019s eyes flashed. \u201cI have come to tell you that your security\nhas been assured, and that the Governor knows you were innocent in the\nmatter and will not dare to harm you. Even to punish Hunt Athalar.\u201d\nShe snorted. Her father stilled. \u201cYou are incredibly foolish if you think\nthat would not be enough to break Athalar at last.\u201d\nRuhn must have told him about that, too. The disaster that had been\nthis thing between her and Hunt. Whatever it had been. Whatever using her\nlike that could be called.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about this.\u201d Not with him, not with anyone. Fury\nhad disappeared again, and while Juniper had messaged, Bryce kept the\nconversation brief. Then the calls from her mother and Randall had started.\nAnd the big lies had begun.\nShe didn\u2019t know why she\u2019d lied about Hunt\u2019s involvement. Maybe\nbecause explaining her own idiocy in letting Hunt in\u2014being so fucking\nblind to the fact that he\u2019d led her around when everyone had warned her,\nthat he\u2019d even told her he would love Shahar until the day he died\u2014was too\nmuch. It gutted her to know he\u2019d chosen the Archangel and their rebellion\nover her, over them \u2026 She couldn\u2019t talk to her mom about it. Not without\ncompletely losing what was left of her ability to function.\nSo Bryce had gone back to work, because what else was there to do?\nShe\u2019d heard nothing from the places where she\u2019d applied for new jobs.\n\u201cI\u2019m not talking about this,\u201d she repeated.\n\u201cYou will talk about this. With your king.\u201d A crackling ember of his\npower set the firstlights guttering.\n\u201cYou are not my king.\u201d\n\u201cLegally, I am,\u201d her father said. \u201cYou are listed as a half-Fae citizen.\nThat places you under my jurisdiction both in this city and as a member of\nthe House of Sky and Breath.\u201d\nShe clicked her nails together. \u201cSo what is it you want to talk about,\nYour Majesty?\u201d\n\u201cHave you stopped looking for the Horn?\u201d\nShe blinked. \u201cDoes it matter now?\u201d\n\u201cIt is a deadly artifact. Just because you learned the truth regarding\nDanika and Athalar doesn\u2019t mean whoever wishes to use it is done.\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t Ruhn tell you? Danika stole the Horn on a lark. Ditched it\nsomewhere in one of her flying-high-as-a-fucking-kite moments. It was a\ndead end.\u201d At her father\u2019s frown, she explained, \u201cThe kristallos were all\naccidentally summoned by Danika and the others who took synth, thanks to\nthe black salt in it. We were wrong in even looking for the Horn. There was\nno one pursuing it.\u201d\nShe couldn\u2019t decide whom she hated more: Hunt, Danika, or herself\nfor not seeing their lies. Not wanting to see any of it. It haunted every step,\nevery breath, that loathing. Burned deep inside.\n\u201cEven if no enemy seeks it, it is worth ensuring that the Horn does not\nfall into the wrong hands.\u201d\n\u201cOnly Fae hands, right?\u201d She smiled coldly. \u201cI thought your Chosen\nOne son was put on its tail.\u201d\n\u201cHe is otherwise occupied.\u201d Ruhn must have told him to go fuck\nhimself.\n\u201cWell, if you can think where Danika unloaded it in her synth-high\nstupor, I\u2019m all ears.\u201d\n\u201cIt is no trivial matter. Even if the Horn is long defunct, it still holds a\nspecial place in Fae history. It will mean a great deal to my people if it is\nrecovered. I\u2019d think with your professional expertise, such a search would\nbe of interest to you. And your employer.\u201d\nShe looked back at her computer screen. \u201cWhatever.\u201d\nHe paused, and then his power buzzed, warping every audio feed\nbefore he said, \u201cI loved your mother very much, you know.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, so much you left a scar on her face.\u201d\nShe could have sworn he flinched. \u201cDo not think I have not spent\nevery moment since then regretting my actions. Living in shame.\u201d\n\u201cCould have fooled me.\u201d\nHis power rumbled through the room. \u201cYou are so much like her. More\nthan you know. She never forgave anyone for anything.\u201d\n\u201cI take that as a compliment.\u201d That fire burned and raged inside her\nhead, her bones.\nHer father said quietly, \u201cI would have made her my queen. I had the\npaperwork ready.\u201d\nShe blinked. \u201cHow surprisingly un-elitist of you.\u201d Her mother had\nnever suggested, never hinted at it. \u201cShe would have hated being queen. She\nwould have said no.\u201d\n\u201cShe loved me enough to have said yes.\u201d Absolute certainty laced his\nwords.\n\u201cYou think that somehow erases what you did?\u201d\n\u201cNo. Nothing shall ever erase what I did.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s skip the woe-is-me bullshit. You came here after all these years\nto tell me this crap?\u201d\nHer father looked at her for a long moment. Then strode for the door,\nopening it in silence. But he said before he stepped into the street, his red\nhair gleaming in the afternoon sunlight, \u201cI came here after all these years to\ntell you that you may be like your mother, but you are also more like me\nthan you realize.\u201d His amber eyes\u2014her own\u2014flickered. \u201cAnd that is not a\ngood thing.\u201d\nThe door shut, the gallery darkening. Bryce stared at the computer\nscreen before her, then typed in a few words.\nThere was still nothing on Hunt. No mention of him in the news. Not a\nwhisper about whether the Umbra Mortis was imprisoned or tortured or\nalive or dead.\nAs if he had never existed. As if she had dreamed him up."}, "69": {"Name": "PART IV THE RAVINE-Chapter 69", "Page Content": " 9 \nHunt ate only because his body demanded it, slept because there was\nnothing else to do, and watched the TV screen in the hall beyond his cell\nbars because he\u2019d brought this upon himself and Vik and Justinian and there\nwas no undoing it.\nMicah had left the latter\u2019s body up. Justinian would hang there for\nseven full days and then be pulled off the crucifix\u2014and dumped into the\nIstros. No Sailings for traitors. Just the bellies of the river beasts.\nViktoria\u2019s box had already been dumped into the Melino\u00eb Trench.\nThe thought of her trapped on the seafloor, the deepest place in\nMidgard, nothing but dark and silence and that tight, tight space \u2026\nDreams of her suffering had launched Hunt over to the toilet, puking\nup his guts.\nAnd then the itching began. Deep in his back, radiating through the\nframework now beginning to regrow, it itched and itched and itched. His\nfledgling wings remained sore enough that scratching them resulted in near-\nblinding pain, and as the hours ticked by, each new bit of growth had him\nclenching his jaw against it.\nA waste, he silently told his body. A big fucking waste to regrow his\nwings, when he was likely hours or days away from an execution.\nHe\u2019d had no visitors since Isaiah six days ago. He\u2019d tracked the time\nby watching the sunlight shift in the atrium on the TV feed.\nNot a whisper from Bryce. Not that he dared hope she\u2019d somehow find\na way to see him, if only to let him beg on his knees for her forgiveness. To\ntell her what he needed to say.\nMaybe Micah would let him rot down here. Let him go mad like Vik,\nburied beneath the earth, unable to fly, unable to feel fresh air on his face.\nThe doors down the hall hissed, and Hunt blinked, rising from his\nsilence. Even his miserably itching wings halted their torture.\nBut the female scent that hit him a heartbeat later was not Bryce\u2019s.\nIt was a scent he knew just as well\u2014would never forget as long as he\nlived. A scent that stalked his nightmares, whetted his rage into a thing that\nmade it impossible to think.\nThe Archangel of northwestern Pangera smiled as she appeared before\nhis cell. He\u2019d never get used to it: how much she looked like Shahar. \u201cThis\nseems familiar,\u201d Sandriel said. Her voice was soft, beautiful. Like music.\nHer face was, too.\nAnd yet her eyes, the color of fresh-tilled soil, gave her away. They\nwere sharp, honed by millennia of cruelty and near-unchecked power. Eyes\nthat delighted in pain and bloodshed and despair. That had always been the\ndifference between her and Shahar\u2014their eyes. Warmth in one; death in the\nother.\n\u201cI heard you want to kill me, Hunt,\u201d the Archangel said, crossing her\nthin arms. She clicked her tongue. \u201cAre we really back to that old game?\u201d\nHe said nothing. Just sat on his cot and held her gaze.\n\u201cYou know, when you had your belongings confiscated, they found\nsome interesting things, which Micah was kind enough to share.\u201d She\npulled an object from her pocket. His phone. \u201cThis in particular.\u201d\nShe waved a hand and his phone screen appeared on the TV behind\nher, its wireless connection showing every movement of her fingers through\nthe various programs. \u201cYour email, of course, was dull as dirt. Do you never\ndelete anything?\u201d She didn\u2019t wait for his response before she went on. \u201cBut\nyour messages \u2026\u201d Her lips curled, and she clicked on the most recent\nchain.\nBryce had changed her contact name one last time, it seemed.\nBryce Thinks Hunt Is the Best had written:\nI know you\u2019re not going to see this. I don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m writing\nto you.\nShe\u2019d messaged a minute after that, I just \u2026 Then another pause.\nNever mind. Whoever is screening this, never mind. Ignore this.\nThen nothing. His head became so, so quiet.\n\u201cAnd you know what I found absolutely fascinating?\u201d Sandriel was\nsaying, clicking away from the messages and going into his photos.\n\u201cThese.\u201d She chuckled. \u201cLook at all of this. Who knew you could act so \u2026\ncommonly?\u201d\nShe hit the slideshow function. Hunt just sat there as photos began\nappearing on the screen.\nHe\u2019d never looked through them. The photos that he and Bryce had\ntaken these weeks.\nThere he was, drinking a beer on her couch, petting Syrinx while\nwatching a sunball game.\nThere he was, making her breakfast because he\u2019d come to enjoy\nknowing that he could take care of her like that. She\u2019d snapped another\nphoto of him working in the kitchen: of his ass. With her own hand in the\nforeground, giving a thumbs-up of approval.\nHe might have laughed, might have smiled, had the next photo not\npopped up. A photo he\u2019d taken this time, of her mid-sentence.\nThen one of him and her on the street, Hunt looking notably annoyed\nat having his photo taken, while she grinned obnoxiously.\nThe photo he\u2019d snapped of her dirty and drenched by the sewer grate,\nspitting mad.\nA photo of Syrinx sleeping on his back, limbs splayed. A photo of\nLehabah in the library, posing like a pinup girl on her little couch. Then a\nphoto he\u2019d gotten of the river at sunset as he flew overhead. A photo of\nBryce\u2019s tattooed back in the bathroom mirror, while she gave a saucy wink\nover her shoulder. A photo he\u2019d taken of an otter in its yellow vest, then one\nhe\u2019d managed to grab a second later of Bryce\u2019s delighted face.\nHe didn\u2019t hear what Sandriel was saying.\nThe photos had begun as an ongoing joke, but they\u2019d become real.\nEnjoyable. There were more of the two of them. And more photos that Hunt\nhad taken, too. Of the food they\u2019d eaten, interesting graffiti along the alleys,\nof clouds and things he normally never bothered to notice but had suddenly\nwanted to capture. And then ones where he looked into the camera and\nsmiled.\nOnes where Bryce\u2019s face seemed to glow brighter, her smile softer.\nThe dates drew closer to the present. There they were, on her couch,\nher head on his shoulder, smiling broadly while he rolled his eyes. But his\narm was around her. His fingers casually tangled in her hair. Then a photo\nhe\u2019d taken of her in his sunball hat. Then a ridiculous medley she\u2019d taken of\nJelly Jubilee and Peaches and Dreams and Princess Creampuff tucked into\nhis bed. Posed on his dresser. In his bathroom.\nAnd then some by the river again. He had a vague memory of her\nasking a passing tourist to snap a few. One by one, the various shots\nunfolded.\nFirst, a photo with Bryce still talking and him grimacing.\nThen one with her smiling and Hunt looking at her.\nThe third was of her still smiling\u2014and Hunt still looking at her. Like\nshe was the only person on the planet. In the galaxy.\nHis heart thundered. In the next few, her face had turned toward him.\nTheir eyes had met. Her smile had faltered.\nAs if realizing how he was looking at her.\nIn the next, she was smiling at the ground, his eyes still on her. A\nsecret, soft smile. Like she knew, and didn\u2019t mind one bit.\nAnd then in the last, she had leaned her head against his chest, and\nwrapped her arms around his middle. He\u2019d put his arm and wing around\nher. And they had both smiled.\nTrue, broad smiles. Belonging to the people they might have been\nwithout the tattoo on his brow and the grief in her heart and this whole\nstupid fucking world around them.\nA life. These were the photos of someone with a life, and a good one at\nthat. A reminder of what it had felt like to have a home, and someone who\ncared whether he lived or died. Someone who made him smile just by\nentering a room.\nHe\u2019d never had that before. With anyone.\nThe screen went dark, and then the photos began again.\nAnd he could see it, this time. How her eyes\u2014they had been so cold at\nthe start. How even with her ridiculous pictures and poses, that smile hadn\u2019t\nreached her eyes. But with each photo, more light had crept into them.\nBrightened them. Brightened his eyes, too. Until those last photos. When\nBryce was near-glowing with joy.\nShe was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen.\nSandriel was smirking like a cat. \u201cIs this really what you wanted in the\nend, Hunt?\u201d She gestured to the photos. To Bryce\u2019s smiling face. \u201cTo be\nfreed one day, to marry the girl, to live out some ordinary, basic life?\u201d She\nchuckled. \u201cWhatever would Shahar say?\u201d\nHer name didn\u2019t clang. And the guilt he thought would sear him didn\u2019t\nso much as sizzle.\nSandriel\u2019s full lips curved upward, a mockery of her twin\u2019s smile.\n\u201cSuch simple, sweet wishes, Hunt. But that\u2019s not how these things work\nout. Not for people like you.\u201d\nHis stomach twisted. The photos were torture, he realized. To remind\nhim of the life he might have had. What he\u2019d tasted on the couch with\nBryce the other night. What he\u2019d pissed away.\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Sandriel said, \u201cif you had played the obedient dog, Micah\nwould have eventually petitioned for your freedom.\u201d The words pelted him.\n\u201cBut you couldn\u2019t be patient. Couldn\u2019t be smart. Couldn\u2019t choose this\u201d\u2014\nshe gestured to their photos\u2014\u201cover your own petty revenge.\u201d Another\nsnake\u2019s smile. \u201cSo here we are. Here you are.\u201d She studied a photo Hunt\nhad taken of Bryce with Syrinx, the chimera\u2019s pointed little teeth bared in\nsomething terrifyingly close to a grin. \u201cThe girl will probably cry her little\nheart out for a while. But then she\u2019ll forget you, and she\u2019ll find someone\nelse. Maybe there will be some Fae male who can stomach an inferior\npairing.\u201d\nHunt\u2019s senses pricked, his temper stirring.\nSandriel shrugged. \u201cOr she\u2019ll wind up in a dumpster with the other\nhalf-breeds.\u201d\nHis fingers curled into fists. There was no threat in Sandriel\u2019s words.\nJust the terrible practicality of how their world treated people like Bryce.\n\u201cThe point is,\u201d Sandriel continued, \u201cshe will go on. And you and I will\ngo on, Hunt.\u201d\nAt last, at last, he dragged his eyes from Bryce and the photos of the\nlife, the home, they\u2019d made. The life he still so desperately, stupidly\nwanted. His wings resumed their itching. \u201cWhat.\u201d\nSandriel\u2019s smile sharpened. \u201cDidn\u2019t they tell you?\u201d\nDread curled as he looked at his phone in her hands. As he realized\nwhy he\u2019d been left alive, and why Sandriel had been allowed to take his\nbelongings.\nThey were her belongings now.\nBryce entered the near-empty bar just after eleven. The lack of a brooding\nmale presence guarding her back was like a phantom limb, but she ignored\nit, made herself forget about it as she spotted Ruhn sitting at the counter,\nsipping his whiskey.\nOnly Flynn had joined him, the male too busy seducing the female\ncurrently playing billiards with him to give Bryce more than a wary, pitying\nnod. She ignored it and slid onto the stool beside Ruhn, her dress squeaking\nagainst the leather. \u201cHi.\u201d\nRuhn glanced sidelong at her. \u201cHey.\u201d\nThe bartender strode over, brows raised in silent question. Bryce shook\nher head. She didn\u2019t plan to be here long enough for a drink, water or\notherwise. She wanted this over with as quickly as possible so she could go\nback home, take off her bra, and put on her sweats.\nBryce said, \u201cI wanted to come by to say thanks.\u201d Ruhn only stared at\nher. She watched the sunball game on the TV above the bar. \u201cFor the other\nday. Night. For looking out for me.\u201d\nRuhn squinted at the tiled ceiling.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cI\u2019m just checking to see if the sky\u2019s falling, since you\u2019re thanking me\nfor something.\u201d\nShe shoved his shoulder. \u201cAsshole.\u201d\n\u201cYou could have called or messaged.\u201d He sipped from his whiskey.\n\u201cI thought it\u2019d be more adultlike to do it face-to-face.\u201d\nHer brother surveyed her carefully. \u201cHow are you holding up?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been better.\u201d She admitted, \u201cI feel like a fucking idiot.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not.\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah? Half a dozen people warned me, you included, to be on my\nguard around Hunt, and I laughed in all your faces.\u201d She blew out a breath.\n\u201cI should have seen it.\u201d\n\u201cIn your defense, I didn\u2019t think Athalar was still that ruthless.\u201d His\nblue eyes blazed. \u201cI thought his priorities had shifted lately.\u201d\nShe rolled her eyes. \u201cYeah, you and dear old Dad.\u201d\n\u201cHe visited you?\u201d\n\u201cYep. Told me I\u2019m just as big a piece of shit as he himself is. Like\nfather, like daughter. Like calls to like or whatever.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re nothing like him.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t bullshit a bullshitter, Ruhn.\u201d She tapped the bar. \u201cAnyway,\nthat\u2019s all I came to say.\u201d She noted the Starsword hanging at his side, its\nblack hilt not reflecting the firstlights in the room. \u201cYou on patrol tonight?\u201d\n\u201cNot until midnight.\u201d With his Fae metabolism, the whiskey would be\nout of his system long before then.\n\u201cWell \u2026 good luck.\u201d She hopped off the stool, but Ruhn halted her\nwith a hand on her elbow.\n\u201cI\u2019m having some people over at my place in a couple weeks to watch\nthe big sunball game. Why don\u2019t you come over?\u201d\n\u201cPass.\u201d\n\u201cJust come for the first period. If it isn\u2019t your thing, no problem. Leave\nwhen you want.\u201d\nShe scanned his face, weighing the offer there. The hand extended.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked quietly. \u201cWhy keep bothering?\u201d\n\u201cWhy keep pushing me away, Bryce?\u201d His voice strained. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t\njust about that fight.\u201d\nShe swallowed, her throat thick. \u201cYou were my best friend,\u201d she said.\n\u201cBefore Danika, you were my best friend. And I \u2026 It doesn\u2019t matter now.\u201d\nShe\u2019d realized back then that the truth didn\u2019t matter\u2014she wouldn\u2019t let it\nmatter. She shrugged, as if it\u2019d help lighten the crushing weight in her chest.\n\u201cMaybe we could start over. On a trial basis only.\u201d\nRuhn started to smile. \u201cSo you\u2019ll come watch the game?\u201d\n\u201cJuniper was supposed to come over that day, but I\u2019ll see if she\u2019s up\nfor it.\u201d Ruhn\u2019s blue eyes twinkled like stars, but Bryce cut in, \u201cNo promises,\nthough.\u201d\nHe was still grinning when she rose from her barstool. \u201cI\u2019ll save a seat\nfor you.\u201d"}, "70": {"Name": "PART IV THE RAVINE-Chapter 70", "Page Content": " 0 \nFury was sitting on the couch when Bryce returned from the bar. In the\nexact spot where she\u2019d gotten used to seeing Hunt.\nBryce chucked her keys onto the table beside the front door, loosed\nSyrinx upon her friend, and said, \u201cHey.\u201d\n\u201cHey, yourself.\u201d Fury gave Syrinx a look that stopped him in his\ntracks. That made him sit his fluffy butt down on the carpet, lion\u2019s tail\nswaying, and wait until she deigned to greet him. Fury did so after a\nheartbeat, ruffling his velvety, folded ears.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Bryce toed off her heels, rotated her aching feet a few\ntimes, and reached back to tug at the zipper to her dress. Gods, it was\nincredible to have no pain in her leg\u2014not even a flicker. She padded for her\nbedroom before Fury could answer, knowing she\u2019d hear anyway.\n\u201cI got some news,\u201d Fury said casually.\nBryce peeled off her dress, sighing as she took off her bra, and\nchanged into a pair of sweats and an old T-shirt before pulling her hair into\na ponytail. \u201cLet me guess,\u201d she said from the bedroom, shoving her feet\ninto slippers, \u201cyou finally realized that black all the time is boring and want\nme to help you find some real-person clothes?\u201d\nA quiet laugh. \u201cSmart-ass.\u201d Bryce emerged from the bedroom, and\nFury eyed her with that swift assassin\u2019s stare. So unlike Hunt\u2019s.\nEven when she and Fury had been out partying, Fury never really lost\nthat cold gleam. That calculation and distance. But Hunt\u2019s stare\u2014\nShe shut out the thought. The comparison. That roaring fire in her\nveins flared.\n\u201cLook,\u201d Fury said, standing from the couch. \u201cI\u2019m heading out a few\ndays early to the Summit. So I just thought you should know something\nbefore I go.\u201d\n\u201cYou love me and you\u2019ll write often?\u201d\n\u201cGods, you\u2019re the worst,\u201d Fury said, running a hand through her sleek\nbob. Bryce missed the long ponytail her friend had worn in college. The\nnew look made Fury seem even more lethal, somehow. \u201cEver since I met\nyou in that dumb-ass class, you\u2019ve been the worst.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but you find it delightful.\u201d Bryce aimed for the fridge.\nA huff. \u201cLook, I\u2019m going to tell you this, but I want you to first\npromise me that you won\u2019t do anything stupid.\u201d\nBryce froze with her fingers grasping the handle of the fridge. \u201cAs\nyou\u2019ve told me so often, stupid is my middle name.\u201d\n\u201cI mean it this time. I don\u2019t even think anything can be done, but I\nneed you to promise.\u201d\n\u201cI promise.\u201d\nFury studied her face, then leaned against the kitchen counter. \u201cMicah\ngave Hunt away.\u201d\nThat fire in her veins withered to ash. \u201cTo whom?\u201d\n\u201cWho do you think? Fucking Sandriel, that\u2019s who.\u201d\nShe couldn\u2019t feel her arms, her legs. \u201cWhen.\u201d\n\u201cYou said you wouldn\u2019t do anything stupid.\u201d\n\u201cIs asking for details stupid?\u201d\nFury shook her head. \u201cThis afternoon. That bastard knew giving Hunt\nback to Sandriel was a bigger punishment than publicly crucifying him or\nshoving his soul into a box and dumping it into the sea.\u201d\nIt was. For so many reasons.\nFury went on, \u201cShe and the other angels are heading to the Summit\ntomorrow afternoon. And I have it on good authority that once the\nmeeting\u2019s done next week, she\u2019ll go back to Pangera to keep dealing with\nthe Ophion rebels. With Hunt in tow.\u201d\nAnd he\u2019d never be free again. What Sandriel would do to him \u2026 He\ndeserved it. He fucking deserved everything.\nBryce said, \u201cIf you\u2019re so concerned I\u2019ll do something stupid, why tell\nme at all?\u201d\nFury\u2019s dark eyes scanned her again. \u201cBecause \u2026 I just thought you\nshould know.\u201d\nBryce turned to the fridge. Yanked it open. \u201cHunt dug his own grave.\u201d\n\u201cSo you two weren\u2019t \u2026\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cHis scent is on you, though.\u201d\n\u201cWe lived in this apartment together for a month. I\u2019d think it\u2019d be on\nme.\u201d\nShe\u2019d handed over a hideous number of silver marks to have his blood\nremoved from the couch. Along with all traces of what they\u2019d done there.\nA small, strong hand slammed the fridge door shut. Fury glared up at\nher. \u201cDon\u2019t bullshit me, Quinlan.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d Bryce let her friend see her true face. The one her father had\ntalked about. The one that did not laugh and did not care for anybody or\nanything. \u201cHunt is a liar. He lied to me.\u201d\n\u201cDanika did some fucked-up stuff, Bryce. You know that. You always\nknew it and laughed it off, looked the other way. I\u2019m not so sure Hunt was\nlying about that.\u201d\nBryce bared her teeth. \u201cI\u2019m over it.\u201d\n\u201cOver what?\u201d\n\u201cAll of it.\u201d She yanked open the fridge again, nudging Fury out of the\nway. To her surprise, Fury let her. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go back to Pangera and\nignore me for another two years?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t ignore you.\u201d\n\u201cYou fucking did,\u201d Bryce spat. \u201cYou talk to June all the time, and yet\nyou dodge my calls and barely reply to my messages?\u201d\n\u201cJune is different.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I know. The special one.\u201d\nFury blinked at her. \u201cYou nearly died that night, Bryce. And Danika\ndid die.\u201d The assassin\u2019s throat bobbed. \u201cI gave you drugs\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI bought that mirthroot.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I bought the lightseeker. I don\u2019t fucking care, Bryce. I got too\nclose to all of you, and bad things happen when I do that with people.\u201d\n\u201cAnd yet you can still talk to Juniper?\u201d Bryce\u2019s throat closed up. \u201cI\nwasn\u2019t worth the risk to you?\u201d\nFury hissed, \u201cJuniper and I have something that is none of your\nfucking business.\u201d Bryce refrained from gaping. Juniper had never hinted,\nnever suggested\u2014\u201cI could no sooner stop talking to her than I could rip out\nmy own fucking heart, okay?\u201d\n\u201cI get it, I get it,\u201d Bryce said. She blew out a long breath. \u201cLove\ntrumps all.\u201d\nToo fucking bad Hunt hadn\u2019t realized that. Or he had, but he\u2019d just\nchosen the Archangel who still held his heart and their cause. Too fucking\nbad Bryce had still been stupid enough to believe nonsense about love\u2014and\nlet it blind her.\nFury\u2019s voice broke. \u201cYou and Danika were my friends. You were these\ntwo stupid fucking puppies that came bounding into my perfectly fine life,\nand then one of you was slaughtered.\u201d Fury bared her teeth. \u201cAnd. I.\nCouldn\u2019t. Fucking. Deal.\u201d\n\u201cI needed you. I needed you here. Danika died, but it was like I lost\nyou, too.\u201d Bryce didn\u2019t fight the burning in her eyes. \u201cYou walked away\nlike it was nothing.\u201d\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t.\u201d Fury blew out a breath. \u201cFuck, did Juniper not tell you\nanything?\u201d At Bryce\u2019s silence, she swore again. \u201cLook, she and I have been\nworking through a lot of my shit, okay? I know it was fucked up that I\nbailed like that.\u201d She dragged her fingers through her hair. \u201cIt\u2019s all just \u2026\nit\u2019s more fucked than you know, Bryce.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever.\u201d\nFury angled her head. \u201cDo I need to call Juniper?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cIs this a repeat of two winters ago?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Juniper must have told her about that night on the roof. They\ntold each other everything, apparently.\nBryce grabbed a jar of almond butter, screwed off the lid, and dug in\nwith a spoon. \u201cWell, have fun at the Summit. See you in another two years.\u201d\nFury didn\u2019t smile. \u201cDon\u2019t make me regret telling you all this.\u201d\nShe met her friend\u2019s dark stare. \u201cI\u2019m over it,\u201d she said again.\nFury sighed. \u201cAll right.\u201d Her phone buzzed and she peered at the\nscreen before saying, \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a week. Let\u2019s hang then, okay? Maybe\nwithout screaming at each other.\u201d\n\u201cSure.\u201d\nFury stalked for the door, but paused on the threshold. \u201cIt\u2019ll get better,\nBryce. I know the past two years have been shit, but it will get better. I\u2019ve\nbeen there, and I promise you it does.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Bryce added, because real concern shone on Fury\u2019s normally\ncold face, \u201cThanks.\u201d\nFury had the phone to her ear before she\u2019d shut the door. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m\non my way,\u201d she said. \u201cWell, why don\u2019t you shut the fuck up and let me\ndrive so I can get there on time, dickbag?\u201d\nThrough the peephole, Bryce watched her get onto the elevator. Then\ncrossed the room and watched from the window as Fury climbed into a\nfancy black sports car, gunned the engine, and roared off into the streets.\nBryce peered at Syrinx. The chimera wagged his little lion\u2019s tail.\nHunt had been given away. To the monster he hated and feared above\nall others.\n\u201cI am over it,\u201d she said to Syrinx.\nShe looked toward the couch, and could nearly see Hunt sitting there,\nthat sunball cap on backward, watching a game on TV. Could nearly see his\nsmile as he looked over his shoulder at her.\nThat roaring fire in her veins halted\u2014and redirected. She wouldn\u2019t\nlose another friend.\nEspecially not Hunt. Never Hunt.\nNo matter what he had done, what and who he\u2019d chosen, even if this\nwas the last she would ever see of him \u2026 she wouldn\u2019t let this happen. He\ncould go to Hel afterward, but she would do this. For him.\nSyrinx whined, pacing in a circle, claws clicking on the wood floor.\n\u201cI promised Fury not to do anything stupid,\u201d Bryce said, her eyes on\nSyrinx\u2019s branded-out tattoo. \u201cI didn\u2019t say I wouldn\u2019t do something smart.\u201d"}, "71": {"Name": "PART IV THE RAVINE-Chapter 71", "Page Content": " 1 \nHunt had a night to puke out his guts.\nOne night in that cell, likely the last bit of security he\u2019d have for the\nrest of his existence.\nHe knew what would happen after the Summit. When Sandriel took\nhim back to her castle in the misty, mountainous wilds of northwestern\nPangera. To the gray-stoned city in its heart.\nHe\u2019d lived it for more than fifty years, after all.\nShe\u2019d left the photo feed up on the hallway TV screen, so he could see\nBryce over and over and over. See the way Bryce had looked at him by the\nend, like he wasn\u2019t a complete waste of life.\nIt wasn\u2019t just to torture him with what he\u2019d lost.\nIt was a reminder. Of who would be targeted if he disobeyed. If he\nresisted. If he fought back.\nBy dawn, he\u2019d stopped puking. Had washed his face in the small sink.\nA change of clothes had arrived for him. His usual black armor. No helmet.\nHis back itched incessantly as he dressed, the cloth scraping against\nthe wings that were taking form. Soon they\u2019d be fully regenerated. A week\nof careful physical therapy after that and he\u2019d be in the skies.\nIf Sandriel ever let him out of her dungeons.\nShe\u2019d lost him once, to pay off her debts. He had few illusions that\nshe\u2019d allow it to happen again. Not until she found a way to break him for\nhow he\u2019d targeted her forces on Mount Hermon. How he and Shahar had\ncome so close to destroying her completely.\nIt wasn\u2019t until nearly sunset that they came for him. As if Sandriel\nwanted him stewing all day.\nHunt let them shackle him again with the gorsian stones. He knew\nwhat the stones would do if he so much as moved wrong. Disintegration of\nblood and bone, his brain turned into soup before it leaked out his nose.\nThe armed guard, ten deep, led him from the cell and into the elevator.\nWhere Pollux Antonius, the golden-haired commander of Sandriel\u2019s triarii,\nwaited, a smile on his tan face.\nHunt knew that dead, cruel smile well. Had tried his best to forget it.\n\u201cMiss me, Athalar?\u201d Pollux asked, his clear voice belying the monster\nlurking within. The Hammer could smash through battlefields and delighted\nin every second of carnage. Of fear and pain. Most Vanir never walked\naway. No humans ever had.\nBut Hunt didn\u2019t let his rage, his hatred for that smirking, handsome\nvisage so much as flicker across his face. A glimmer of annoyance flashed\nin Pollux\u2019s cobalt eyes, his white wings shifting.\nSandriel waited in the Comitium lobby, the last of the sunlight shining\nin her curling hair.\nThe lobby. Not the landing pad levels above. So he might see\u2014\nMight see\u2014\nJustinian still hung from the crucifix. Rotting away.\n\u201cWe thought you might want to say goodbye,\u201d Pollux purred in his ear\nas they crossed the lobby. \u201cThe wraith, of course, is at the bottom of the sea,\nbut I\u2019m sure she knows you\u2019ll miss her.\u201d\nHunt let the male\u2019s words flow through him, out of him. They would\nonly be the start. Both from the Malleus and from Sandriel herself.\nThe Archangel smiled at Hunt as they approached, the cruelty on her\nface making Pollux\u2019s smirk look downright pleasant. But she said nothing\nas she turned on her heel toward the lobby doors.\nAn armed transport van idled outside, back doors flung wide. Waiting\nfor him, since he sure as fuck couldn\u2019t fly. From the mocking gleam in\nPollux\u2019s eyes, Hunt had a feeling he knew who would be accompanying\nhim.\nAngels from the Comitium\u2019s five buildings filled the lobby.\nHe noted Micah\u2019s absence\u2014coward. The bastard probably didn\u2019t want\nto sully himself by witnessing the horror he\u2019d inflicted. But Isaiah stood\nnear the heart of the gathered crowd, his expression grim. Naomi gave Hunt\na grave nod.\nIt was all she dared, the only farewell they could make.\nThe angels silently watched Sandriel. Pollux. Him. They hadn\u2019t come\nto taunt, to witness his despair and humiliation. They, too, had come to say\ngoodbye.\nEvery step toward the glass doors was a lifetime, was impossible.\nEvery step was abhorrent.\nHe had done this, brought this upon himself and his companions, and\nhe would pay for it over and over and\u2014\n\u201cWait!\u201d The female voice rang out from across the lobby.\nHunt froze. Everyone froze.\n\u201cWait!\u201d\nNo. No, she couldn\u2019t be here. He couldn\u2019t bear for her to see him like\nthis, knees wobbling and a breath away from puking again. Because Pollux\nstrode beside him, and Sandriel prowled in front of him, and they would\ndestroy her\u2014\nBut there was Bryce. Running toward them. Toward him.\nFear and pain tightened her face, but her wide eyes were trained on\nhim as she shouted again, to Sandriel, to the entire lobby full of angels,\n\u201cWait!\u201d\nShe was breathless as the crowd parted. Sandriel halted, Pollux and the\nguards instantly on alert, forcing Hunt to pause with them, too.\nBryce skidded to a stop before the Archangel. \u201cPlease,\u201d she panted,\nbracing her hands on her knees, her ponytail drooping over a shoulder as\nshe tried to catch her breath. No sign of that limp. \u201cPlease, wait.\u201d\nSandriel surveyed her like she would a gnat buzzing about her head.\n\u201cYes, Bryce Quinlan?\u201d\nBryce straightened, still panting. Looked at Hunt for a long moment,\nfor eternity, before she said to the Archangel of northwestern Pangera,\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t take him.\u201d\nHunt could barely stand to hear the plea in her voice. Pollux let out a\nsoft, hateful laugh.\nSandriel was not amused. \u201cHe has been gifted to me. The papers were\nsigned yesterday.\u201d\nBryce pulled something from her pocket, causing the guards around\nthem to reach for their weapons. Pollux\u2019s sword was instantly in his hand,\nangled toward her with lethal efficiency.\nBut it wasn\u2019t a gun or a knife. It was a piece of paper.\n\u201cThen let me buy him from you.\u201d\nUtter silence.\nSandriel laughed then, the sound rich and lilting. \u201cDo you know how\nmuch\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll pay you ninety-seven million gold marks.\u201d\nThe floor rocked beneath Hunt. People gasped. Pollux blinked, eyeing\nBryce again.\nBryce extended a piece of paper toward Sandriel, though the malakh\ndidn\u2019t take it. Even from a few feet behind the Archangel, Hunt\u2019s sharp\neyesight could make out the writing.\nProof of funds. A check from the bank, made out to Sandriel. For\nnearly a hundred million marks.\nA check from Jesiba Roga.\nHorror sluiced through him, rendering him speechless. How many\nyears had Bryce added to her debt?\nHe didn\u2019t deserve it. Didn\u2019t deserve her. Not for a heartbeat. Not in a\nthousand years\u2014\nBryce waved the check toward Sandriel. \u201cTwelve million more than\nhis asking price when you sold him, right? You\u2019ll\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI know how to do the mathematics.\u201d\nBryce remained with her arm outstretched. Hope in her beautiful face.\nThen she reached up, Pollux and the guards tensing again. But it was to just\nunclasp the golden amulet from around her neck. \u201cHere. To sweeten the\ndeal. An Archesian amulet. It\u2019s fifteen thousand years old, and fetches\naround three million gold marks on the market.\u201d\nThat tiny necklace was worth three million gold marks?\nBryce extended both the necklace and the paper, the gold glinting.\n\u201cPlease.\u201d\nHe couldn\u2019t let her do it. Not even for what remained of his soul. Hunt\nopened his mouth, but the Archangel took the dangling necklace from\nBryce\u2019s fingers. Sandriel glanced between them. Read everything on Hunt\u2019s\nface. A snake\u2019s smile curled her mouth. \u201cYour loyalty to my sister was the\none good thing about you, Athalar.\u201d She clenched her fist around the\namulet. \u201cBut it seems those photographs did not lie.\u201d\nThe Archesian amulet melted into streams of gold on the floor.\nSomething ruptured in Hunt\u2019s chest at the devastation that crumpled\nBryce\u2019s face.\nHe said quietly to her, his first words all day, \u201cGet out of here, Bryce.\u201d\nBut Bryce pocketed the check. And slid to her knees.\n\u201cThen take me.\u201d\nTerror rocked him, so violently he had no words when Bryce looked\nup at Sandriel, tears filling her eyes as she said, \u201cTake me in his place.\u201d\nA slow grin spread across Pollux\u2019s face.\nNo. She\u2019d already traded her eternal resting place in the Bone Quarter\nfor Danika. He couldn\u2019t let her trade her mortal life for him. Not for him\u2014\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare!\u201d The male bellow cracked across the space. Then\nRuhn was there, wreathed in shadows, Declan and Flynn flanking him.\nThey weren\u2019t foolish enough to reach for their guns as they sized up\nSandriel\u2019s guards. Realized that Pollux Antonius, the Malleus, stood there,\nsword angled to punch through Bryce\u2019s chest if Sandriel so much as gave\nthe nod.\nThe Crown Prince of the Fae pointed at Bryce. \u201cGet off the floor.\u201d\nBryce didn\u2019t move. She just repeated to Sandriel, \u201cTake me in his\nplace.\u201d\nHunt snapped at Bryce, \u201cBe quiet,\u201d just as Ruhn snarled at the\nArchangel, \u201cDon\u2019t listen to a word she says\u2014\u201d\nSandriel took a step toward Bryce. Another. Until she stood before her,\npeering down into Bryce\u2019s flushed face.\nHunt pleaded, \u201cSandriel\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou offer your life,\u201d Sandriel said to Bryce. \u201cUnder no coercion, no\nforce.\u201d\nRuhn lunged forward, shadows unfurling around him, but Sandriel\nraised a hand and a wall of wind held him in check. It choked off the\nprince\u2019s shadows, shredding them into nothing.\nIt held Hunt in check, too, as Bryce met Sandriel\u2019s stare and said, \u201cYes.\nIn exchange for Hunt\u2019s freedom, I offer myself in his place.\u201d Her voice\nshook, cracking. She knew how he\u2019d suffered at the Archangel\u2019s hands.\nKnew what awaited her would be even worse.\n\u201cEveryone here would call me a fool to take this bargain,\u201d Sandriel\nmused. \u201cA half-breed with no true power or hope to come into it\u2014in\nexchange for the freedom of one of the most powerful malakim to ever\ndarken the skies. The only warrior on Midgard who can wield lightning.\u201d\n\u201cSandriel, please,\u201d Hunt begged. The air ripping from his throat\nchoked off his words.\nPollux smiled again. Hunt bared his teeth at him as Sandriel stroked a\nhand over Bryce\u2019s cheek, wiping away her tears. \u201cBut I know your secret,\nBryce Quinlan,\u201d Sandriel whispered. \u201cI know what a prize you are.\u201d\nRuhn cut in, \u201cThat is enough\u2014\u201d\nSandriel stroked Bryce\u2019s face again. \u201cThe only daughter of the Autumn\nKing.\u201d\nHunt\u2019s knees wobbled.\n\u201cHoly fuck,\u201d Tristan Flynn breathed. Declan had gone pale as death.\nSandriel purred at Bryce, \u201cYes, what a prize you would be to possess.\u201d\nHer cousin\u2019s face was stark with terror.\nNot cousin. Brother. Ruhn was her brother. And Bryce was \u2026\n\u201cWhat does your father think of his bastard daughter borrowing such a\nvast amount from Jesiba Roga?\u201d Sandriel went on, chuckling as Bryce\nbegan crying in earnest now. \u201cWhat shame it would bring upon his royal\nhousehold, knowing you sold your life away to a half-rate sorceress.\u201d\nBryce\u2019s pleading eyes met his. The amber eyes of the Autumn King.\nSandriel said, \u201cYou thought you were safe from me? That after you\npulled your little stunt when I arrived, I wouldn\u2019t look into your history?\nMy spies are second to none. They found what could not be found.\nIncluding your life span test from twelve years ago, and whom it exposed as\nyour father. Even though he paid steeply to bury it.\u201d\nRuhn stepped forward, either pushing past Sandriel\u2019s wind or being\nallowed to do so. He grabbed Bryce under the arm and hauled her to her\nfeet. \u201cShe is a female member of the Fae royal household and a full civitas\nof the Republic. I lay claim to her as my sister and kin.\u201d\nAncient words. From laws that had never been changed, though public\nsentiment had.\nBryce whirled on him. \u201cYou have no right\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBased upon the laws of the Fae, as approved by the Asteri,\u201d Ruhn\ncharged on, \u201cshe is my property. My father\u2019s. And I do not permit her to\ntrade herself in exchange for Athalar.\u201d\nHunt\u2019s legs almost gave out with relief. Even as Bryce shoved at Ruhn,\nclawed at him, and growled, \u201cI\u2019m no property of yours\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou are a Fae female of my bloodline,\u201d Ruhn said coldly. \u201cYou are\nmy property and our father\u2019s until you marry.\u201d\nShe looked to Declan, to Flynn, whose solemn faces must have told\nher she\u2019d find no allies among them. She hissed at Ruhn, \u201cI will never\nforgive you. I will never\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re done here,\u201d Ruhn said to Sandriel.\nHe tugged Bryce away, his friends falling into formation around them,\nand Hunt tried to memorize her face, even with despair and rage twisting it.\nRuhn tugged her again, but she thrashed against him.\n\u201cHunt,\u201d she pleaded, stretching a hand for him, \u201cI\u2019ll find a way.\u201d\nPollux laughed. Sandriel just began to turn from them, bored.\nBut Bryce continued to reach for him, even as Ruhn tried to drag her\ntoward the doors.\nHunt stared at her outstretched fingers. The desperate hope in her eyes.\nNo one had ever fought for him. No one had ever cared enough to do\nso.\n\u201cHunt,\u201d Bryce begged, shaking. Her fingers strained. \u201cI\u2019ll find a way\nto save you.\u201d\n\u201cStop it,\u201d Ruhn ordered, and grabbed for her waist.\nSandriel walked toward the lobby doors and the awaiting motorcade.\nShe said to Ruhn, \u201cYou should have slit your sister\u2019s throat when you had\nthe chance, Prince. I speak from personal experience.\u201d\nBryce\u2019s wrenching sobs ripped at Hunt as Pollux shoved him into\nmovement.\nShe\u2019d never stop fighting for him, would never give up hope. So Hunt\nwent in for the kill as he passed her, even as each word broke him apart, \u201cI\nowe you nothing, and you owe me nothing. Don\u2019t ever come looking for me\nagain.\u201d\nBryce mouthed his name. As if he were the sole person in the room.\nThe city. The planet.\nAnd it was only when Hunt was loaded onto the armored truck, when\nhis chains were anchored to the metal sides and Pollux was smirking across\nfrom him, when the driver had embarked on the five-hour drive to the town\nin the heart of the Psamathe Desert where the Summit would be held in five\ndays, that he let himself take a breath.\nRuhn watched as Pollux loaded Athalar into that prison van. Watched as it\nrumbled to life and sped off, watched as the crowd in the lobby dispersed,\nmarking the end of this fucking disaster.\nUntil Bryce wrenched out of his grip. Until Ruhn let her. Pure,\nundiluted hatred twisted her features as she said again, \u201cI will never forgive\nyou for this.\u201d\nRuhn said coldly, \u201cDo you have any idea what Sandriel does to her\nslaves? Do you know that was Pollux Antonius, the fucking Hammer, with\nher?\u201d\n\u201cYes. Hunt told me everything.\u201d\n\u201cThen you\u2019re a fucking idiot.\u201d She advanced on him, but Ruhn\nseethed, \u201cI will not apologize for protecting you\u2014not from her, and not\nfrom yourself. I get it, I do. Hunt was your\u2014whatever he was to you. But\nthe last thing he would ever want is\u2014\u201d\n\u201cGo fuck yourself.\u201d Her breathing turned jagged. \u201cGo fuck yourself,\nRuhn.\u201d\nRuhn jerked his chin toward the lobby doors in dismissal. \u201cCry about it\nto someone else. You\u2019ll have a hard time finding anyone who\u2019ll agree with\nyou.\u201d\nHer fingers curled at her sides. As if she\u2019d punch him, claw him, shred\nhim.\nBut she just spat at Ruhn\u2019s feet and stalked away. Bryce reached her\nscooter and didn\u2019t look back as she zoomed off.\nFlynn said, voice low, \u201cWhat the fuck, Ruhn.\u201d\nRuhn sucked in a breath. He didn\u2019t even want to think about what kind\nof bargain she\u2019d struck with the sorceress to get that kind of money.\nDeclan was shaking his head. And Flynn \u2026 disappointment and hurt\nflickered on his face. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell us? Your sister, Ruhn?\u201d Flynn\npointed to the glass doors. \u201cShe\u2019s our fucking princess.\u201d\n\u201cShe is not,\u201d Ruhn growled. \u201cThe Autumn King has not recognized\nher, nor will he ever.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Dec demanded.\n\u201cBecause she\u2019s his bastard child. Because he doesn\u2019t like her. I don\u2019t\nfucking know,\u201d Ruhn spat. He couldn\u2019t\u2014wouldn\u2019t\u2014ever tell them his own\nmotivations for it. That deep-rooted fear of what the Oracle\u2019s prophecy\nmight mean for Bryce should she ever be granted a royal title. For if the\nroyal bloodline was to end with Ruhn, and Bryce was officially a princess\nof their family \u2026 She would have to be out of the picture for it to come to\npass. Permanently. He\u2019d do whatever was necessary to keep her safe from\nthat particular doom. Even if the world hated him for it.\nIndeed, at his friends\u2019 disapproving frowns, he snapped, \u201cAll I know is\nthat I was given an order never to reveal it, even to you.\u201d\nFlynn crossed his arms. \u201cYou think we would have told anyone?\u201d\n\u201cNo. But I couldn\u2019t take the risk of him finding out. And she didn\u2019t\nwant anyone to know.\u201d And now wasn\u2019t the time or place to speak about\nthis. Ruhn said, \u201cI need to talk to her.\u201d\nWhat came after he spoke with Bryce, he didn\u2019t know if he could\nhandle.\nBryce rode to the river. To the arches of the Black Dock.\nDarkness had fallen by the time she chained her scooter to a lamppost,\nthe night balmy enough that she was grateful for Danika\u2019s leather jacket\nkeeping her warm as she stood on the dark dock and stared across the Istros.\nSlowly, she sank to her knees, bowing her head. \u201cIt\u2019s so fucked,\u201d she\nwhispered, hoping the words would carry across the water, to the tombs and\nmausoleums hidden behind the wall of mist. \u201cIt is all so, so fucked,\nDanika.\u201d\nShe\u2019d failed. Utterly and completely failed. And Hunt was \u2026 he was\n\u2026\nBryce buried her face in her hands. For a while, the only sounds were\nthe wind hissing through the palms and the lapping of the river against the\ndock.\n\u201cI wish you were here,\u201d Bryce finally allowed herself to say. \u201cEvery\nday, I wish that, but today especially.\u201d\nThe wind quieted, the palms going still. Even the river seemed to halt.\nA chill crept toward her, through her. Every sense, Fae and human,\nwent on alert. She scanned the mists, waiting, praying for a black boat. She\nwas so busy looking that she didn\u2019t see the attack coming.\nDidn\u2019t twist to see a kristallos demon leaping from the shadows, jaws\nopen, before it tackled her into the eddying waters."}, "72": {"Name": "PART IV THE RAVINE-Chapter 72", "Page Content": " 2 \nClaws and teeth were everywhere. Ripping at her, snatching her, dragging\nher down.\nThe river was pitch-black, and there was no one, no one at all, who\u2019d\nseen or would know\u2014 Something burned along her arm, and she screamed,\nwater rushing down her throat.\nThen the claws splayed. Loosened.\nBryce kicked, shoving blindly away, the surface somewhere\u2014in any\ndirection\u2014oh gods, she was going to pick wrong\u2014 Something grabbed her\nby the shoulder, dragging her away, and she would have screamed if there\nhad been any air left in her lungs\u2014 Air broke around her face, open and\nfresh, and then there was a male voice at her ear saying, \u201cI\u2019ve got you, I\u2019ve\ngot you.\u201d\nShe might have sobbed, if she hadn\u2019t spewed water, hadn\u2019t launched\ninto a coughing fit. Hunt had said those words to her, and now Hunt was\ngone, and the male voice at her ear\u2014Declan Emmet.\nRuhn shouted from a few feet away, \u201cIt\u2019s down.\u201d\nShe thrashed, but Declan held her firm, murmuring, \u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t fucking all right. Hunt should have been there. He should\nhave been with her, he should have been freed, and she should have found a\nway to help him\u2014 It took half a moment for Declan to heave her out of the\nwater. Ruhn, his face grim, hauled her the rest of the way, cursing up a\nstorm while she shuddered on the dock.\n\u201cWhat the fucking fuck,\u201d Tristan Flynn was panting, rifle aimed at the\nblack water, ready to unload a hail of bullets at the slightest ripple.\n\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Declan asked, water streaming down his face, red\nhair plastered to his head.\nBryce drew back into herself enough to survey her body. A gash sliced\ndown her arm, but it had been made with claws, not those venomous teeth.\nOther slices peppered her, but \u2026\nDeclan didn\u2019t wait before kneeling before her, hands wreathed in light\nas he held them over the gash in her arm. It was rare\u2014the Fae healing gift.\nNot as powerful as the talent of a medwitch, but a valuable strength to\npossess. She\u2019d never known Dec had the ability.\nRuhn asked, \u201cWhy the fuck were you standing on the Black Dock after\nsundown?\u201d\n\u201cI was kneeling,\u201d she muttered.\n\u201cSame fucking question.\u201d\nShe met her brother\u2019s gaze as her wounds healed shut. \u201cI needed a\nbreather.\u201d\nFlynn muttered something.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d She narrowed her eyes at him.\nFlynn crossed his arms. \u201cI said I\u2019ve known that you\u2019re a princess for\nall of an hour and you\u2019re already a pain in my ass.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not a princess,\u201d she said at the same moment Ruhn snapped,\n\u201cShe\u2019s not a princess.\u201d\nDeclan snorted. \u201cWhatever, assholes.\u201d He pulled back from Bryce,\nhealing complete. \u201cWe should have realized. You\u2019re the only one who even\ncomes close to getting under Ruhn\u2019s skin as easily as his father does.\u201d\nFlynn cut in, \u201cWhere did that thing come from?\u201d\n\u201cApparently,\u201d she said, \u201cpeople who take large quantities of synth can\ninadvertently summon a kristallos demon. It was probably a freak\naccident.\u201d\n\u201cOr a targeted attack,\u201d Flynn challenged.\n\u201cThe case is over,\u201d Bryce said flatly. \u201cIt\u2019s done.\u201d\nThe Fae lord\u2019s eyes flashed with a rare show of anger. \u201cMaybe it\nisn\u2019t.\u201d\nRuhn wiped the water off his face. \u201cOn the chance Flynn\u2019s right,\nyou\u2019re staying with me.\u201d\n\u201cOver my dead fucking body.\u201d Bryce stood, water pouring off her.\n\u201cLook, thanks for rescuing me. And thanks for royally fucking me and Hunt\nover back there. But you know what?\u201d She bared her teeth and pulled out\nher phone, wiping water from it, praying the protective spell she\u2019d paid\ngood money for had held. It had. She scrolled through screens until she got\nto Ruhn\u2019s contact info. She showed it to him. \u201cYou?\u201d She swiped her finger,\nand it was deleted. \u201cAre dead to me.\u201d\nShe could have sworn her brother, her fuck-you-world brother,\nflinched.\nShe looked at Dec and Flynn. \u201cThanks for saving my ass.\u201d\nThey didn\u2019t come after her. Bryce could barely stop shaking long\nenough to steer her scooter home, but she somehow made it. Made it\nupstairs, walked Syrinx.\nThe apartment was too quiet without Hunt in it. No one had come to\ntake his things. If they had, they\u2019d have found that sunball hat missing.\nHidden in the box alongside Jelly Jubilee.\nExhausted, Bryce peeled off her clothes and stared at herself in the\nbathroom mirror. She lifted a palm to her chest, where the weight of the\nArchesian amulet had been for the past three years.\nRed, angry lines marred her skin where the kristallos had swiped, but\nwith Declan\u2019s magic still working on her, they\u2019d be faded to nothing by\nmorning.\nShe twisted, bracing herself to see the damage to the tattoo on her\nback. This last shred of Danika. If that fucking demon had wrecked it \u2026\nShe nearly wept to see it intact. To look at the lines in that ancient,\nunreadable alphabet and know that even with everything gone to Hel, this\nstill remained: The words Danika had insisted they ink there, with Bryce\ntoo plastered to object. Danika had picked the alphabet out of some booklet\nat the shop, though it sure as fuck didn\u2019t look like any Bryce recognized.\nMaybe the artist had just made it up, and told them it said what Danika had\nwanted: Through love, all is possible.\nThe same words on the jacket in a pile at her feet. The same words that\nhad been a clue\u2014to her Redner account, to finding that flash drive.\nNonsense. It was all fucking nonsense. The tattoo, the jacket, losing\nthat amulet, losing Danika, losing Connor and the Pack of Devils, losing\nHunt\u2014 Bryce tried and failed to wrest herself from the cycle of thoughts,\nthe maelstrom that brought them around and around and around, until they\nall eddied together."}, "73": {"Name": "PART IV THE RAVINE-Chapter 73", "Page Content": " 3 \nThe last Summit Hunt had attended had been in an ancient, sprawling\npalace in Pangera, bedecked in the riches of the empire: silk tapestries and\nsconces of pure gold, goblets twinkling with precious stones, and succulent\nmeats crusted in the rarest spices.\nThis one was held in a conference center.\nThe glass and metal space was sprawling, its layout reminding Hunt of\na bunch of shoeboxes stacked beside and atop each other. Its central hall\nrose three stories high, the stairs and escalators at the back of the space\nadorned with the crimson banners of the Republic, the long pathway\nleading to them carpeted in white.\nEach territory in Midgard held their own Summit every ten years,\nattended by various leaders within their borders, along with a representative\nof the Asteri and a few visiting dignitaries relevant to whatever issues\nwould be discussed. This one was no different, save for its smaller scope:\nThough Valbara was far smaller than Pangera, Micah held four different\nSummit meetings, each for a separate quadrant of his realm. This one, for\nthe southeastern holdings\u2014with Lunathion\u2019s leaders at its heart\u2014was the\nfirst.\nThe site, located in the heart of the Psamathe Desert, a good five-hour\ndrive from Crescent City\u2014an hour for an angel at top flying speeds or a\nmere half hour by helicopter\u2014had its own holding cells for dangerous\nVanir.\nHe\u2019d spent the last five days there, marking them by the shift in his\nfood: breakfast, lunch, dinner. At least Sandriel and Pollux had not come to\ntaunt him. At least he had that small reprieve. He\u2019d barely listened to the\nHammer\u2019s attempts to bait him during the drive. He\u2019d barely felt or heard\nanything at all.\nYet this morning, a set of black clothes had arrived with his breakfast\ntray. No weapons, but the uniform was clear enough. So was the message:\nhe was about to be displayed, a mockery of an imperial Triumphus parade,\nfor Sandriel to gloat about regaining ownership of him.\nBut he\u2019d obediently dressed, and let Sandriel\u2019s guards fit the gorsian\nmanacles on him, rendering his power null and void.\nHe followed the guards silently, up through the elevator, and into the\ngrand lobby itself, bedecked in imperial regalia.\nVanir of every House filled the space, most dressed in business clothes\nor what had once been known as courtly attire. Angels, shifters, Fae,\nwitches \u2026 Delegations flanked either side of the red runner leading toward\nthe stairs. Fury Axtar stood among the crowd, clad in her usual assassin\nleathers, watching everyone. She didn\u2019t look his way.\nHunt was led toward a delegation of angels near the staircase\u2014\nmembers of Sandriel\u2019s 45th Legion. Her triarii. Pollux stood in front of\nthem, his commander status marked by his gold armor, his cobalt cape, his\nsmirking face.\nThat smirk only grew as Hunt took up his position nearby, wedged\nbetween her guards.\nHer other triarii were nearly as bad as the Hammer. Hunt would never\nforget any of them: the thin, pale-skinned, dark-haired female known as the\nHarpy; the stone-faced, black-winged male called the Helhound; and the\nhaughty, cold-eyed angel named the Hawk. But they ignored him. Which,\nhe\u2019d learned, was better than their attention.\nNo sign of the Hind, the final member of the triarii\u2014though maybe her\nwork as a spy-breaker in Pangera was too valuable to the Asteri for Sandriel\nto be allowed to drag her here.\nAcross the runner stood Isaiah and the 33rd. What remained of its\ntriarii. Naomi was stunning in her uniform, her chin high and right hand on\nthe hilt of her formal legion sword, its winged cross guard glinting in the\nmorning light.\nIsaiah\u2019s eyes drifted over to his. Hunt, in his black armor, was\npractically naked compared to the full uniform of the Commander of the\n33rd: the bronze breastplate, the epaulets, the greaves and vambraces \u2026\nHunt still remembered how heavy it was. How stupid he\u2019d always felt\ndecked out in the full regalia of the Imperial Army. Like some prize\nwarhorse.\nThe Autumn King\u2019s Auxiliary forces stood to the left of the angels,\ntheir armor lighter but no less ornate. Across from them were the shifters, in\ntheir finest clothes. Amelie Ravenscroft didn\u2019t so much as dare look in his\ndirection. Smaller groups of Vanir filled the rest of the space: mer and\ndaemonaki. No sign of any humans. Certainly no one with mixed heritage,\neither.\nHunt tried not to think of Bryce. Of what had gone down in the lobby.\nPrincess of the Fae. Bastard princess was more like it, but she was still\nthe only daughter of the Autumn King.\nShe might have been furious at him for lying, but she\u2019d lied plenty to\nhim as well.\nDrummers\u2014fucking Hel, the gods-damned drummers\u2014sounded the\nbeat. The trumpeters began a moment later. The rolling, hateful anthem of\nthe Republic filled the cavernous glass space. Everyone straightened as a\nmotorcade pulled up beyond the doors.\nHunt sucked in a breath as Jesiba Roga emerged first, clad in a thigh-\nlength black dress cut to her curvy body, ancient gold glittering at her ears\nand throat, a diaphanous midnight cape flowing behind her on a phantom\nwind. Even in towering high heels, she moved with the eerie smoothness of\nthe House of Flame and Shadow.\nMaybe she\u2019d been the one who told Bryce how to sell her soul to the\nruler of the Sleeping City.\nThe blond sorceress kept her gray eyes on the three flags hanging\nabove the stairs as she moved toward them: on the left, the flag of Valbara;\non the right, the insignia of Lunathion with its crescent moon bow and\narrow. And in the center, the SPQM and its twin branches of stars\u2014the flag\nof the Republic.\nThe witches came next, their steps ringing out. A young, brown-\nskinned female in flowing azure robes strode down the carpet, her braided\nblack hair gleaming like spun night.\nQueen Hypaxia. She\u2019d worn her mother\u2019s gold-and-red crown of\ncloudberries for barely three months, and though her face was unlined and\nbeautiful, there was a weariness to her dark eyes that spoke volumes about\nher lingering grief.\nRumor had it that Queen Hecuba had raised her deep in the boreal\nforest of the Heliruna Mountains, far from the corruption of the Republic.\nHunt might have expected that such a person would shy from the gathered\ncrowd and imperial splendor, or at least gape a little, but her chin remained\nhigh, her steps unfaltering. As if she had done this a dozen times.\nShe was to be formally recognized as Queen of the Valbaran Witches\nwhen the Summit officially began. Her final bit of pageantry before truly\ninheriting her throne. But\u2014\nHunt got a look at her face as she neared.\nHe knew her: the medwitch from the clinic. She acknowledged Hunt\nwith a swift sidelong glance as she passed.\nHad Ruhn known? Who he\u2019d met with, who had fed him research\nabout the synth?\nThe mer leaders arrived, Tharion in a charcoal suit beside a female in a\nflowing, gauzy teal gown. Not the River Queen\u2014she rarely left the Istros.\nBut the beautiful, dark-skinned female might as well have been her\ndaughter. Probably was her daughter, in the way that all mer claimed the\nRiver Queen as their mother.\nTharion\u2019s red-brown hair was slicked back, with a few escaped strands\nhanging over his brow. He\u2019d swapped his fins for legs, but they didn\u2019t falter\nas his eyes slid toward Hunt. Sympathy shone there.\nHunt ignored it. He hadn\u2019t forgotten just who had brought Bryce to the\nbarge that night.\nTharion, to his credit, didn\u2019t balk from Hunt\u2019s stare. He just gave him a\nsad smile and looked ahead, following the witches to the mezzanine level\nand open conference room doors beyond.\nThen came the wolves. Sabine walked beside the hunched figure of the\nPrime, helping the old male along. His brown eyes were milky with age, his\nonce-strong body bent over his cane. Sabine, clad in a dove-gray suit,\nsneered at Hunt, steering the ancient Prime toward the escalator rather than\nthe steps.\nBut the Prime halted upon seeing where she planned to bring him.\nDrew her to the stairs. And began the ascent, step by painful step.\nProud bastard.\nThe Fae left their black cars, stalking onto the carpet. The Autumn\nKing emerged, an onyx crown upon his red hair, the ancient stone like a\npiece of night even in the light of morning.\nHunt didn\u2019t know how he hadn\u2019t seen it before. Bryce looked more\nlike her father than Ruhn did. Granted, plenty of the Fae had that coloring,\nbut the coldness on the Autumn King\u2019s face \u2026 He\u2019d seen Bryce make that\nexpression countless times.\nThe Autumn King, not some prick lordling, had been the one to go\nwith her to the Oracle that day. The one to kick a thirteen-year-old to the\ncurb.\nHunt\u2019s fingers curled at his sides. He couldn\u2019t blame Ember Quinlan\nfor running the moment she\u2019d seen the monster beneath the surface. Felt its\ncold violence.\nAnd realized she was carrying its child. A potential heir to the throne\u2014\none that might complicate things for his pure-blooded, Chosen One son. No\nwonder the Autumn King had hunted them down so ruthlessly.\nRuhn, a step behind his father, was a shock to the senses. In his\nprincely raiment, the Starsword at his side, he could have very well been\none of the first Starborn with that coloring of his. Might have been one of\nthe first through the Northern Rift, so long ago.\nThey passed Hunt, and the king didn\u2019t so much as glance his way. But\nRuhn did.\nRuhn looked to the shackles on Hunt\u2019s wrists, the 45th\u2019s triarii around\nhim. And subtly shook his head. To any observer, it was in disgust, in\nreprimand. But Hunt saw the message.\nI\u2019m sorry.\nHunt kept his face unmoved, neutral. Ruhn moved on, the circlet of\ngilded birch leaves atop his head glinting.\nAnd then the atrium seemed to inhale. To pause.\nThe angels did not arrive in cars. No, they dropped from the skies.\nForty-nine angels in the Asterian Guard, in full white-and-gold regalia,\nmarched into the lobby, spears in their gloved hands and white wings\nshining. Each had been bred, hand-selected, for this life of service. Only the\nwhitest, purest of wings would do. Not one speck of color on them.\nHunt had always thought they were swaggering assholes.\nThey took up spots along the carpet, standing at attention, wings high\nand spears pointing at the glass ceiling, their snowy capes draping to the\nfloor. The white plumes of horsehair on their golden helmets gleamed as if\nfreshly brushed, and the visors remained down.\nThey\u2019d been sent from Pangera as a reminder to all of them, the\nGovernors included, that the ones who held their leashes still monitored\neverything.\nMicah and Sandriel arrived next, side by side. Each in their Governor\u2019s\narmor.\nThe Vanir sank to a knee before them. Yet the Asterian Guard\u2014who\nwould bow only for their six masters\u2014remained standing, their spears like\ntwin walls of thorns that the Governors paraded between.\nNo one dared speak. No one dared breathe as the two Archangels\npassed by.\nThey were all fucking worms at their feet.\nSandriel\u2019s smile seared Hunt as she breezed past. Almost as badly as\nMicah\u2019s utter disappointment and weariness.\nMicah had picked his method of torture well, Hunt would give him\nthat. There was no way Sandriel would let him die quickly. The torment\nwhen he returned to Pangera would last decades. No chance of a new death-\nbargain or a buyout.\nAnd if he so much as stepped out of line, she\u2019d know where to strike\nfirst. Who to strike.\nThe Governors swept up the stairs, their wings nearly touching. Why\nthe two of them hadn\u2019t become a mated pair was beyond Hunt. Micah was\ndecent enough that he likely found Sandriel as abhorrent as everyone else\ndid. But it was still a wonder the Asteri hadn\u2019t ordered the bloodlines\nmerged. It wouldn\u2019t have been unusual. Sandriel and Shahar had been the\nresult of such a union.\nThough perhaps the fact that Sandriel had likely killed her own parents\nto seize power for her and her sister had made the Asteri put a halt to the\npractice.\nOnly when the Governors reached the conference room did those\nassembled in the lobby move, first the angels peeling off for the stairs, the\nrest of the assembly falling into line behind them.\nHunt was kept wedged between two of the 45th\u2019s triarii\u2014the\nHelhound and the Hawk, who both sneered at him\u2014and took in as many\ndetails as he could when they entered the meeting room.\nIt was cavernous, with rings of tables flowing down to a central floor\nand round table where the leaders would sit.\nThe Pit of Hel. That\u2019s what it was. It was a wonder none of its princes\nstood there.\nThe Prime of Wolves, the Autumn King, the two Governors, the River\nQueen\u2019s fair daughter, Queen Hypaxia, and Jesiba all took seats at that\ncentral table. Their seconds\u2014Sabine, Ruhn, Tharion, an older-looking\nwitch\u2014all claimed spots in the ring of tables around them. No one else\nfrom the House of Flame and Shadow had come with Jesiba, not even a\nvampyr. The ranks fell into place beyond that, each ring of tables growing\nlarger and larger, seven in total. The Asterian Guard lined the uppermost\nlevel, standing against the wall, two at each of the room\u2019s three exits.\nThe seven levels of Hel indeed.\nVidscreens were interspersed throughout the room, two hanging from\nthe ceiling itself, and computers lined the tables, presumably for references.\nFury Axtar, to his surprise, took up a spot in the third circle, leaning back in\nher chair. No one else accompanied her.\nHunt was led to a spot against the wall, nestled between two Asterian\nGuards who ignored him completely. Thank fuck the angle blocked his\nview of Pollux and the rest of Sandriel\u2019s triarii.\nHunt braced himself as the vidscreens flicked on. The room went quiet\nat what appeared.\nHe knew those crystal halls, torches of firstlight dancing on the carved\nquartz pillars rising toward the arched ceiling stories above. Knew the\nseven crystal thrones arranged in a curve on the golden dais, the one empty\nthrone at its far end. Knew the twinkling city beyond them, the hills rolling\naway into the dimming light, the Tiber a dark band wending between them.\nEveryone rose from their seats as the Asteri came into view. And\neveryone knelt.\nEven from nearly six thousand miles away, Hunt could have sworn\ntheir power rippled into the conference room. Could have sworn it sucked\nout the warmth, the air, the life.\nThe first time he\u2019d been before them, he\u2019d thought he\u2019d never\nexperienced anything worse. Shahar\u2019s blood had still coated his armor, his\nthroat had still been ravaged from screaming during the battle, and yet he\nhad never encountered anything so horrific. So unearthly. As if his entire\nexistence were but a mayfly, his power but a wisp of breeze in the face of\ntheir hurricane. As if he\u2019d been hurled into deep space.\nThey each held the power of a sacred star, each could level this planet\nto dust, yet there was no light in their cold eyes.\nThrough lowered lashes, Hunt marked who else dared to lift their eyes\nfrom the gray carpet as the six Asteri surveyed them: Tharion and Ruhn.\nDeclan Emmet. And Queen Hypaxia.\nNo others. Not even Fury or Jesiba.\nRuhn met Hunt\u2019s stare. And a quiet male voice said in his head, Bold\nmove.\nHunt held in his shock. He\u2019d known there were occasional telepaths\nout there among the Fae, especially the ones who dwelled in Avallen. But\nhe\u2019d never had a conversation with one. Certainly not inside his head. Neat\ntrick.\nA gift from my mother\u2019s kin\u2014one I\u2019ve kept quiet.\nAnd you trust me with this secret?\nRuhn was silent for a moment. I can\u2019t be seen talking to you. If you\nneed anything, let me know. I\u2019ll do what I can for you.\nAnother shock, as physical as his lightning zapping through him. Why\nwould you help me?\nBecause you would have done everything in your power to keep Bryce\nfrom trading herself to Sandriel. I could see it on your face. Ruhn hesitated,\nthen added, a shade uncertainly, And because I don\u2019t think you\u2019re quite as\nmuch of an asshole now.\nThe corner of Hunt\u2019s mouth lifted. Likewise.\nIs that a compliment? Another pause. How are you holding up,\nAthalar?\nFine. How is she?\nBack at work, according to the eyes I have on her.\nGood. He didn\u2019t think he could endure any more talk of Bryce without\ncompletely falling apart, so he said, Did you know that medwitch was\nQueen Hypaxia?\nNo. I fucking didn\u2019t.\nRuhn might have gone on, but the Asteri began to speak. As one, like\nthey always did. Telepaths in their own regard. \u201cYou have converged to\ndiscuss matters pertaining to your region. We grant you our leave.\u201d They\nlooked to Hypaxia.\nImpressively, the witch didn\u2019t flinch, didn\u2019t so much as tremble as the\nsix Asteri looked upon her, the world watching with them, and said, \u201cWe\nformally recognize you as the heir of the late Queen Hecuba Enador, and\nwith her passing, now anoint you Queen of the Valbaran Witches.\u201d\nHypaxia bowed her head, her face grave. Jesiba\u2019s face revealed\nnothing. Not even a hint of sorrow or anger for the heritage she\u2019d walked\naway from. So Hunt dared a look at Ruhn, who was frowning.\nThe Asteri again surveyed the room, none more haughtily than\nRigelus, the Bright Hand. That slim teenage boy\u2019s body was a mockery of\nthe monstrous power within. As one the Asteri continued, \u201cYou may begin.\nMay the blessings of the gods and all the stars in the heavens shine upon\nyou.\u201d\nHeads bowed further, in thanks for merely being allowed to exist in\ntheir presence.\n\u201cIt is our hope that you discuss a way to end this inane war. Governor\nSandriel will prove a valuable witness to its destruction.\u201d A slow, horrible\nscan through the room followed. And Hunt knew their eyes were upon him\nas they said, \u201cAnd there are others here who may also provide their\ntestimony.\u201d\nThere was only one testimony to provide: that the humans were\nwasteful and foolish, and the war was their fault, their fault, their fault, and\nmust be ended. Must be avoided here at all costs. There was to be no\nsympathy for the human rebellion, no hearing of the humans\u2019 plight. There\nwas only the Vanir side, the good side, and no other.\nHunt held Rigelus\u2019s dead stare on the central screen. A zap of icy wind\nthrough his body courtesy of Sandriel warned him to avert his eyes. He did\nnot. He could have sworn the Head of the Asteri smiled. Hunt\u2019s blood\nturned to ice, not just from Sandriel\u2019s wind, and he lowered his eyes.\nThis empire had been built to last for eternity. In more than fifteen\nthousand years, it had not broken. This war would not be the thing that\nended it.\nThe Asteri said together, \u201cFarewell.\u201d Another small smile from all of\nthem\u2014the worst being Rigelus\u2019s, still directed at Hunt. The screens went\ndark.\nEveryone in the room, the two Governors included, blew out a breath.\nSomeone puked, by the sound and reek from the far corner. Sure enough, a\nleopard shifter bolted through the doors, a hand over his mouth.\nMicah leaned back in his chair, his eyes on the wood table before him.\nFor a moment, no one spoke. As if they all needed to reel themselves back\nin. Even Sandriel.\nThen Micah straightened, his wings rustling, and declared in a deep,\nclear voice, \u201cI hereby commence this Valbaran Summit. All hail the Asteri\nand the stars they possess.\u201d\nThe room echoed the words, albeit half-heartedly. As if everyone\nremembered that even in this land across the sea from Pangera, so far from\nthe muddy battlefields and the shining crystal palace in a city of seven hills,\neven here, there was no escaping."}, "74": {"Name": "PART IV THE RAVINE-Chapter 74", "Page Content": " 4 \nBryce tried not to dwell on the fact that Hunt and the world knew what and\nwho she really was. At least the press hadn\u2019t caught wind of it, for whatever\nsmall mercy that was.\nAs if being a bastard princess meant anything. As if it said anything\nabout her as a person. The shock on Hunt\u2019s face was precisely why she\nhadn\u2019t told him.\nShe\u2019d torn up Jesiba\u2019s check, and with it the centuries of debts.\nNone of it mattered now anyway. Hunt was gone.\nShe knew he was alive. She\u2019d seen the news footage of the Summit\u2019s\nopening procession. Hunt had looked just as he had before everything went\nto shit. Another small mercy.\nShe\u2019d barely noticed the others arriving: Jesiba, Tharion, her sire, her\nbrother \u2026 No, she\u2019d just kept her eyes on that spot in the crowd, those gray\nwings that had now regrown.\nPathetic. She was utterly pathetic.\nShe would have done it. Would have gladly traded places with Hunt,\neven knowing what Sandriel would do to her. What Pollux would do to her.\nMaybe it made her an idiot, as Ruhn said. Na\u00efve.\nMaybe she was lucky to have walked out of the Comitium lobby still\nbreathing.\nMaybe being attacked by that kristallos was payment for her fuckups.\nShe\u2019d spent the past few days looking through the laws to see if there\nwas anything to be done for Hunt. There wasn\u2019t. She\u2019d done the only two\nthings that might have granted him his freedom: offered to buy him, and\noffered herself in his stead.\nShe didn\u2019t believe Hunt\u2019s bullshit last words to her. She would have\nsaid the same had she been in his place. Would have been as nasty as she\ncould, if it would have gotten him to safety.\nBryce sat at the front desk in the showroom, staring at the blank\ncomputer screen. The city had been quiet these past two days. As if\neveryone\u2019s attention was on the Summit, even though only a few of\nCrescent City\u2019s leaders and citizens had gone.\nShe\u2019d watched the news recaps only to catch another glimpse of Hunt\n\u2014without any luck.\nShe slept in his room every night. Had put on one of his T-shirts and\ncrawled between the sheets that smelled of him and pretended he was lying\nin the dark beside her.\nAn envelope with the Comitium listed as its return address had arrived\nat the gallery three days ago. Her heart had thundered as she\u2019d ripped it\nopen, wondering if he\u2019d been able to get a message out\u2014\nThe white opal had fallen to the desk. Isaiah had written a reserved\nnote, as if aware that every piece of mail was read:\nNaomi found this on the barge. Thought you might want it back.\nThen he\u2019d added, as if on second thought, He\u2019s sorry.\nShe\u2019d slid the stone into her desk drawer.\nSighing, Bryce opened it now, peering at the milky gem. She ran her\nfinger over its cool surface.\n\u201cAthie looks miserable,\u201d Lehabah observed, floating by Bryce\u2019s head.\nShe pointed to the tablet, where Bryce had paused her third replay of the\nopening procession on Hunt\u2019s face. \u201cSo do you, BB.\u201d\n\u201cThank you.\u201d\nAt her feet, Syrinx stretched out, yawning. His curved claws glinted.\n\u201cSo what do we do now?\u201d\nBryce\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\nLehabah wrapped her arms around herself, floating in midair. \u201cWe just\ngo back to normal?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nHer flickering eyes met Bryce\u2019s. \u201cWhat is normal, anyway?\u201d\n\u201cSeems boring to me.\u201d\nLehabah smiled slightly, turning a soft rose color.\nBryce offered one in return. \u201cYou\u2019re a good friend, Lele. A really good\nfriend.\u201d She sighed again, setting the sprite\u2019s flame guttering. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I\nhaven\u2019t been such a good one to you at times.\u201d\nLehabah waved a hand, going scarlet. \u201cWe\u2019ll get through this, BB.\u201d\nShe perched on Bryce\u2019s shoulder, her warmth seeping into skin Bryce\nhadn\u2019t realized was so cold. \u201cYou, me, and Syrie. Together, we\u2019ll get\nthrough this.\u201d\nBryce held up a finger, letting Lehabah take it in both of her tiny,\nshimmering hands. \u201cDeal.\u201d"}, "75": {"Name": "PART IV THE RAVINE-Chapter 75", "Page Content": " 5 \nRuhn had anticipated that the Summit would be intense, vicious, flat-out\ndangerous\u2014each moment spent wondering whether someone\u2019s throat\nwould be ripped out. Just as it was at every one he\u2019d attended.\nThis time, his only enemy seemed to be boredom.\nIt had taken Sandriel all of two hours to tell them that the Asteri had\nordered more troops to the front from every House. There was no point in\narguing. It wasn\u2019t going to change. The order had come from the Asteri.\nTalk turned to the new trade proposals. And then circled and circled\nand circled, even Micah getting caught in the semantics of who did what\nand got what and on and on until Ruhn was wondering if the Asteri had\ncome up with this meeting as some form of torture.\nHe wondered how many of the Asterian Guard were sleeping behind\ntheir masks. He\u2019d caught a few of the lesser members of the various\ndelegations nodding off. But Athalar was alert\u2014every minute, the assassin\nseemed to be listening. Watching.\nMaybe that was what the Governors wanted: all of them so bored and\ndesperate to end this meeting that they eventually agreed to terms that\nweren\u2019t to their advantage.\nThere were a few holdouts, still. Ruhn\u2019s father being one, along with\nthe mer and the witches.\nOne witch in particular.\nQueen Hypaxia spoke little, but he noticed that she, too, listened to\nevery word being bandied about, her rich brown eyes full of wary\nintelligence despite her youth.\nIt had been a shock to see her the first day\u2014that familiar face in this\nsetting, with her crown and royal robes. To know he\u2019d been talking to his\nwould-be betrothed for weeks now with no fucking idea.\nHe\u2019d managed to slip between two of her coven members as they filed\ninto the dining hall the first day, and, like an asshole, demanded, \u201cWhy\ndidn\u2019t you say anything? About who you really are?\u201d\nHypaxia held her lunch tray with a grace better suited to holding a\nscepter. \u201cYou didn\u2019t ask.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the Hel were you doing in that shop?\u201d\nHer dark eyes shuttered. \u201cMy sources told me that evil was stirring in\nthe city. I came to see for myself\u2014discreetly.\u201d It was why she\u2019d been at the\nscene of the temple guard\u2019s murder, he realized. And there the night Athalar\nand Bryce had been attacked in the park. \u201cI also came to see what it was\nlike to be \u2026 ordinary. Before this.\u201d She waved with a hand toward her\ncrown.\n\u201cDo you know what my father expects of you? And me?\u201d\n\u201cI have my suspicions,\u201d she said coolly. \u201cBut I am not considering\nsuch \u2026 changes in my life right now.\u201d She gave him a nod before walking\naway. \u201cNot with anyone.\u201d\nAnd that was it. His ass had been handed to him.\nToday, at least, he\u2019d tried to pay attention. To not look at the witch who\nhad absolutely zero interest in marrying him, thank fuck. With her healing\ngifts, could she sense whatever was wrong inside him that would mean he\nwas the last of the bloodline? He didn\u2019t want to find out. Ruhn shoved away\nthe memory of the Oracle\u2019s prophecy. He wasn\u2019t the only one ignoring\nHypaxia, at least. Jesiba Roga hadn\u2019t spoken one word to her.\nGranted, the sorceress hadn\u2019t said much, other than to assert that the\nHouse of Flame and Shadow thrived on death and chaos, and had no quarrel\nwith a long, devastating war. Reapers were always happy to ferry the souls\nof the dead, she said. Even the Archangels had looked disconcerted at that.\nAs the clock struck nine and all took their seats in the room, Sandriel\nannounced, \u201cMicah has been called away, and will be joining us later.\u201d\nOnly one person\u2014well, six of them\u2014could summon Micah away\nfrom this meeting. Sandriel seemed content to rule over the day\u2019s\nproceedings, and declared, \u201cWe will begin with the mer explaining their\nshortsighted resistance to the building of a canal for the transportation of\nour tanks and the continuation of the supply lines.\u201d\nThe River Queen\u2019s daughter bit her bottom lip, hesitating. But it was\nCaptain Tharion Ketos who drawled to Sandriel, \u201cI\u2019d say that when your\nwar machines rip up our oyster beds and kelp forests, it\u2019s not shortsighted to\nsay that it will destroy our fishing industry.\u201d\nSandriel\u2019s eyes flashed. But she said sweetly, \u201cYou will be\ncompensated.\u201d\nTharion didn\u2019t back down. \u201cIt is not just about the money. It is about\nthe care of this planet.\u201d\n\u201cWar requires sacrifice.\u201d\nTharion crossed his arms, muscles rippling beneath his black long-\nsleeved T-shirt. After the initial parade and that first day of endless\nmeetings, most of them had donned far less formal wear for the rest of the\ntalks. \u201cI know the costs of war, Governor.\u201d\nBold male, to say that, to look Sandriel dead in the eye.\nQueen Hypaxia said, her voice soft but unflinching, \u201cTharion\u2019s\nconcern has merit. And precedent.\u201d Ruhn straightened as all eyes slid\ntoward the witch-queen. She, too, did not back down from the storms in\nSandriel\u2019s eyes. \u201cAlong the eastern borders of the Rhagan Sea, the coral and\nkelp beds that were destroyed in the Sorvakkian Wars two thousand years\nago have still not returned. The mer who farmed them were compensated,\nas you claim. But only for a few seasons.\u201d Utter silence in the meeting\nroom. \u201cWill you pay, Governor, for a thousand seasons? Two thousand\nseasons? What of the creatures who make their homes in places you\npropose to destroy? How shall you pay them?\u201d\n\u201cThey are Lowers. Lower than the Lowers,\u201d Sandriel said coldly,\nunmoved.\n\u201cThey are children of Midgard. Children of Cthona,\u201d the witch-queen\nsaid.\nSandriel smiled, all teeth. \u201cSpare me your bleeding-heart nonsense.\u201d\nHypaxia didn\u2019t smile back. She just held Sandriel\u2019s stare. No challenge\nin it, but frank assessment.\nTo Ruhn\u2019s eternal shock, it was Sandriel who looked away first, rolling\nher eyes and shuffling her papers. Even his father blinked at it. And\nassessed the young queen with a narrowed gaze. No doubt wondering how a\ntwenty-six-year-old witch had the nerve. Or what Hypaxia might have on\nSandriel to make an Archangel yield to her.\nWondering if the witch-queen would indeed be a good bride for Ruhn\n\u2014or a thorn in his side.\nAcross the table, Jesiba Roga smiled slightly at Hypaxia. Her first\nacknowledgment of the young witch.\n\u201cThe canal,\u201d Sandriel said tightly, setting down her papers, \u201cwe shall\ndiscuss later. The supply lines \u2026\u201d The Archangel launched into another\nspeech about her plans to streamline the war.\nHypaxia went back to the papers before her. But her eyes lifted to the\nsecond ring of tables.\nTo Tharion.\nThe mer male gave her a slight, secret smile\u2014gratitude and\nacknowledgment.\nThe witch-queen nodded back, barely a dip of her chin.\nThe mer male just casually lifted his paper, flashing what looked like\nabout twenty rows of markings\u2014counting something.\nHypaxia\u2019s eyes widened, bright with reproach and disbelief, and\nTharion lowered the paper before anyone else noticed. Added another slash\nto it.\nA flush crept over the witch-queen\u2019s cheeks.\nHis father, however, began speaking, so Ruhn ignored their antics and\nsquared his shoulders, trying his best to look like he was paying attention.\nLike he cared.\nNone of it would matter, in the end. Sandriel and Micah would get\nwhat they wanted.\nAnd everything would remain the same.\nHunt was so bored he honestly thought his brain was going to bleed out his\nears.\nBut he tried to savor these last days of calm and relative comfort, even\nwith Pollux monitoring everything from across the room. Waiting until he\ncould stop appearing civilized. Hunt knew Pollux was counting down the\nhours until he\u2019d be unleashed upon him.\nSo every time the asshole smiled at him, Hunt grinned right back.\nHunt\u2019s wings, at least, had healed. He\u2019d been testing them as much as\nhe could, stretching and flexing. If Sandriel allowed him to get airborne, he\nknew they\u2019d carry him. Probably.\nStanding against the wall, dissecting each word spoken, was its own\nform of torture, but Hunt listened. Paid attention, even when it seemed like\nso many others were fighting sleep.\nHe hoped the delegations who held out\u2014the Fae, the mer, the witches\n\u2014would last until the end of the Summit before remembering that control\nwas an illusion and the Asteri could simply issue an edict regarding the new\ntrade laws. Just as they had with the war update.\nA few more days, that was all Hunt wanted. That\u2019s what he told\nhimself."}, "76": {"Name": "PART IV THE RAVINE-Chapter 76", "Page Content": " 6 \nBryce had camped out in the gallery library for the past three days, staying\nwell after closing and returning at dawn. There was no point in spending\nmuch time at the apartment, since her fridge was empty and Syrinx was\nalways with her. She figured she might as well be at the office until she\nstopped feeling like her home was just an empty shell.\nJesiba, busy with the Summit, didn\u2019t check the gallery video feeds.\nDidn\u2019t see the takeout containers littering every surface of the library, the\nmini fridge mostly full of cheese, or the fact that Bryce had started wearing\nher athletic clothes into the office. Or that she\u2019d begun showering in the\nbathroom in the back of the library. Or that she\u2019d canceled all their client\nmeetings. And taken a new Archesian amulet right from the wall safe in\nJesiba\u2019s office\u2014the very last one in the territory. One of five left in the\nentire world.\nIt was only a matter of time, however, until Jesiba got bored and pulled\nup the dozens of feeds to see everything. Or looked at their calendar and\nsaw all the rescheduled appointments.\nBryce had heard back about two potential new jobs, and had\ninterviews lined up. She\u2019d need to invent some excuse to feed Jesiba, of\ncourse. A medwitch appointment or teeth cleaning or something else normal\nbut necessary. And if she got one of those jobs, she\u2019d have to come up with\na plan for repaying her debt for Syrinx\u2014something that would please\nJesiba\u2019s ego enough to keep her from transforming Bryce into some awful\ncreature just for asking to leave.\nBryce sighed, running a hand over an ancient tome full of legal jargon\nthat required a degree to decipher. She\u2019d never seen so many ergos and\ntherefores and hence the followings and shall be included but not limited\ntos. But she kept looking.\nSo did Lehabah. \u201cWhat about this, BB?\u201d The sprite flared, pointing to\na page before her. \u201cIt says here, A criminal\u2019s sentence may be commuted to\nservice if\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWe saw that one two days ago,\u201d Bryce said. \u201cIt leads us right back to\nslavery.\u201d\nA faint scratching filled the room. Bryce glanced at the n\u00f8kk from\nunder her lashes, careful not to let him see her attention.\nThe creature was grinning at her anyway. Like it knew something she\ndidn\u2019t.\nShe found out why a moment later.\n\u201cThere\u2019s another case beneath it,\u201d Lehabah said. \u201cThe human woman\nwas freed after\u2014\u201d\nSyrinx growled. Not at the tank. At the green-carpeted stairs.\nCasual footsteps thudded. Bryce was instantly standing, reaching for\nher phone.\nA pair of boots, then dark jeans, and then\u2014\nSnow-white wings. An unfairly beautiful face.\nMicah.\nEvery thought short-circuited as he stepped into the library, surveying\nits shelves and the stairs leading to the brass mezzanines and alcoves, the\ntank and the n\u00f8kk who was still grinning, the exploding-sun light high\nabove.\nHe couldn\u2019t be down here. Couldn\u2019t see these books\u2014\n\u201cYour Grace,\u201d Bryce blurted.\n\u201cThe front door was open,\u201d he said. The sheer power behind his stare\nwas like being hit in the face with a brick.\nOf course the locks and enchantments hadn\u2019t kept him out. Nothing\ncould ever keep him out.\nShe calmed her racing heart enough to say, \u201cI\u2019d be happy to meet with\nyou upstairs, Your Grace, if you want me to phone Jesiba.\u201d\nJesiba, who is at the Summit where you are currently supposed to be.\n\u201cDown here is fine.\u201d He slowly stalked over to one of the towering\nshelves.\nSyrinx was shaking on the couch; Lehabah hid behind a small stack of\nbooks. Even the animals in their various cages and small tanks cowered.\nOnly the n\u00f8kk kept smiling.\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you have a seat, Your Grace?\u201d Bryce said, scooping\ntakeout containers into her arms, not caring if she got chili oil on her white\nT-shirt, only that Micah got the fuck away from the shelves and those\nprecious books.\nHe ignored her, examining the titles at eye level.\nUrd save her. Bryce dumped the takeout containers into the\noverflowing trash can. \u201cWe have some fascinating art upstairs. Perhaps you\ncan tell me what you\u2019re looking for.\u201d She glanced at Lehabah, who had\nturned a startling shade of cyan, and shook her head in a silent warning to\nbe careful.\nMicah folded his wings, and turned to her. \u201cWhat I\u2019m looking for?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d she breathed. \u201cI\u2014\u201d\nHe pinned her with those icy eyes. \u201cI\u2019m looking for you.\u201d\nToday\u2019s meeting was by far the worst. The slowest.\nSandriel delighted in leading them in circles, lies and half-truths\nspewing from her lips, as if savoring the kill soon to come: the moment they\nyielded everything to her and the Asteri\u2019s wishes.\nHunt leaned against the wall, standing between the Asterian Guards in\ntheir full regalia, and watched the clock inch toward four. Ruhn looked like\nhe\u2019d fallen asleep half an hour ago. Most of the lower-level parties had been\ndismissed, leaving the room barely occupied. Even Naomi had been sent\nback to Lunathion to make sure the 33rd remained in shape. Only skeleton\nstaff and their leaders remained. As if everyone now knew this was over.\nThat this republic was a sham. Either one ruled or one bowed.\n\u201cOpening a new port along the eastern coastline of Valbara,\u201d Sandriel\nsaid for the hundredth time, \u201cwould allow us to build a secure facility for\nour aquatic legion\u2014\u201d\nA phone buzzed.\nJesiba Roga, to his surprise, pulled it from an inner pocket of the gray\nblazer she wore over a matching dress. She shifted in her seat, angling the\nphone away from the curious male to her left.\nA few of the other leaders had noticed Roga\u2019s change in attention.\nSandriel kept talking, unaware, but Ruhn had stirred at the sound and was\nlooking at the woman. So was Fury, seated two rows behind her.\nJesiba\u2019s thumbs flew over her phone, her red-painted mouth tightening\nas she lifted a hand. Even Sandriel shut up.\nRoga said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry to interrupt, Governor, but there\u2019s something\nthat you\u2014that all of us\u2014need to see.\u201d\nHe had no rational reason for the dread that began to curl in his\nstomach. Whatever was on her phone could have been about anything. Yet\nhis mouth dried up.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Sabine demanded from across the room.\nJesiba ignored her, and glanced to Declan Emmet. \u201cCan you link\nwhat\u2019s on my phone to these screens?\u201d She indicated the array of them\nthroughout the room.\nDeclan, who had been half-asleep in the circle behind Ruhn, instantly\nstraightened. \u201cYeah, no problem.\u201d He was smart enough to look to Sandriel\nfirst\u2014and the Archangel rolled her eyes but nodded. Declan\u2019s laptop was\nopen a heartbeat later. He frowned at what popped up on the laptop, but\nthen he hit a button.\nAnd revealed dozens of different video feeds\u2014all from Griffin\nAntiquities. In the lower right corner, in a familiar library \u2026 Hunt forgot to\nbreathe entirely.\nEspecially as Jesiba\u2019s phone buzzed again, and a message\u2014a\ncontinuation of a previous conversation, it seemed\u2014popped up on the\nscreens. His heart stalled at the name: Bryce Quinlan.\nHis heart wholly stopped at the message. Are the feeds on yet?\n\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Ruhn hissed.\nBryce was standing in front of the camera, pouring what seemed to be\na glass of wine. And behind her, seated at the main table of the library, was\nMicah.\nSandriel murmured, \u201cHe said he had a meeting \u2026\u201d\nThe camera was hidden inside one of the books, just above Bryce\u2019s\nhead.\nDeclan hit a few keys on his computer, pulling up that particular feed.\nAnother keystroke and its audio filled the conference room.\nBryce was saying over her shoulder, throwing Micah a casual smile,\n\u201cWould you like some food with your wine? Cheese?\u201d\nMicah lounged at the table, surveying a spread of books. \u201cThat would\nbe appreciated.\u201d\nBryce hummed, covertly typing on her phone as she fiddled on the\nrefreshment cart.\nThe next message to Jesiba blared across the conference room screens.\nOne word that had Hunt\u2019s blood going cold.\nHelp.\nIt was not a cheeky, charming plea. Not as Bryce lifted her gaze to the\ncamera.\nFear shone there. Stark, bright fear. Every instinct in Hunt went on\nroaring alert.\n\u201cGovernor,\u201d the Autumn King said to Sandriel, \u201cI would like an\nexplanation.\u201d\nBut before Sandriel could reply, Ruhn quietly ordered, with eyes glued\nto the feeds, \u201cFlynn, send an Aux unit to Griffin Antiquities. Right now.\u201d\nFlynn instantly had his phone out, fingers flying.\n\u201cMicah has not done anything wrong,\u201d Sandriel snapped at the Fae\nPrince. \u201cExcept demonstrate his poor choice in females.\u201d\nHunt\u2019s snarl ripped from him.\nIt would have earned him a whip of cold wind from Sandriel, he knew,\nhad the sound not been hidden by matching snarls from Declan and Ruhn.\nTristan Flynn was snapping at someone, \u201cGet over to Griffin\nAntiquities right now. Yes, in the Old Square. No\u2014just go. That is a fucking\norder.\u201d\nRuhn barked another command at the Fae lord, but Micah began\nspeaking again.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve certainly been busy.\u201d Micah motioned to the table. \u201cLooking\nfor a loophole?\u201d\nBryce swallowed as she began assembling a plate for Micah. \u201cHunt is\nmy friend.\u201d\nThose were\u2014those were law books on the table. Hunt\u2019s stomach\ndropped to his feet.\n\u201cAh yes,\u201d Micah said, leaning back in his chair. \u201cI admire that about\nyou.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the fuck is going on?\u201d Fury bit out.\n\u201cLoyal unto death\u2014and beyond,\u201d Micah continued. \u201cEven with all the\nproof in the world, you still didn\u2019t believe Danika was little better than a\ndrug-addicted whore.\u201d\nSabine and several wolves growled. Hunt heard Amelie Ravenscroft\nsay to Sabine, \u201cWe should send a wolf pack.\u201d\n\u201cAll the top packs are here,\u201d Sabine murmured, eyes fixed on the feed.\n\u201cEvery top security force is here. I only left a few behind.\u201d\nBut like a struck match, Bryce\u2019s entire countenance shifted. Fear\npivoted into bright, sharp anger. Hunt ordinarily thrilled to see that blazing\nlook. Not now.\nUse your fucking head, he silently begged her. Be smart.\nBryce let Micah\u2019s insult settle, surveying the platter of cheese and\ngrapes she was assembling. \u201cWho knows what the truth is?\u201d she asked\nblandly.\n\u201cThe philosophers in this library certainly had opinions on the matter.\u201d\n\u201cOn Danika?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t play stupid.\u201d Micah\u2019s smile widened. He gestured to the books\naround them. \u201cDo you know that harboring these volumes earns you a one-\nway ticket to execution?\u201d\n\u201cSeems like a lot of fuss over some books.\u201d\n\u201cHumans died for these books,\u201d Micah purred, motioning to the\nshelves towering around them. \u201cBanned titles, if I\u2019m not mistaken, many of\nthem supposed to only exist in the Asteri Archives. Evolution, mathematics,\ntheories to disprove the superiority of the Vanir and Asteri. Some from\nphilosophers people claimed existed before the Asteri arrived.\u201d A soft,\nawful laugh. \u201cLiars and heretics, who admitted they were wrong when the\nAsteri tortured them for the truth. They were burned alive with the heretical\nworks used as kindling. And yet here, they survive. All the knowledge of\nthe ancient world. Of a world before Asteri. And theories of a world in\nwhich the Vanir are not your masters.\u201d\n\u201cInteresting,\u201d Bryce said. She still did not turn to face him.\nRuhn said to Jesiba, \u201cWhat, exactly, is in that library?\u201d\nJesiba said nothing. Absolutely nothing. Her gray eyes promised cold\ndeath, though.\nMicah went on, unwittingly answering the prince\u2019s question. \u201cDo you\neven know what you are surrounded by, Bryce Quinlan? This is the Great\nLibrary of Parthos.\u201d\nThe words clanged through the room. Jesiba refused to so much as\nopen her mouth.\nBryce, to her credit, said, \u201cSounds like a lot of conspiracy theory crap.\nParthos is a bedtime story for humans.\u201d\nMicah chuckled. \u201cSays the female with the Archesian amulet around\nher neck. The amulet of the priestesses who once served and guarded\nParthos. I think you know what\u2019s here\u2014that you spend your days in the\nmidst of all that remains of the library after most of it burned at Vanir hands\nfifteen thousand years ago.\u201d\nHunt\u2019s stomach turned. He could have sworn a chill breeze drifted\nfrom Jesiba.\nMicah went on idly, \u201cDid you know that during the First Wars, when\nthe Asteri gave the order, it was at Parthos that a doomed human army made\nits final stand against the Vanir? To save proof of what they were before the\nRifts opened\u2014to save the books. A hundred thousand humans marched that\nday knowing they would die, and lose the war.\u201d Micah\u2019s smile grew. \u201cAll to\nbuy the priestesses time to grab the most vital volumes. They loaded them\nonto ships and vanished. I am curious to learn how they landed with Jesiba\nRoga.\u201d\nThe sorceress watching her truth unfold on the screens still did not\nspeak. To acknowledge what had been suggested. Did it have something to\ndo with why she\u2019d left the witches? Or why she\u2019d joined the Under-King?\nMicah leaned back in his seat, wings rustling. \u201cI\u2019ve long suspected that\nthe remains of Parthos were housed here\u2014a record of two thousand years\nof human knowledge before the Asteri arrived. I took one look at some of\nthe titles on the shelves and knew it to be true.\u201d\nNo one so much as blinked as the truth settled. But Jesiba pointed to\nthe screens and said to Tristan Flynn, to Sabine, her voice shaking, \u201cTell the\nAux to move their fucking asses. Save those books. I beg you.\u201d\nHunt ground his teeth. Of course the books were more important to her\nthan Bryce.\n\u201cThe Aux shall do no such thing,\u201d Sandriel said coldly. She smiled at\nJesiba as the female went rigid. \u201cAnd whatever Micah has in mind for your\nlittle assistant is going to look mild compared to what the Asteri do to you\nfor harboring that lying rubbish\u2014\u201d\nBut Bryce picked up the cheese tray and glass of wine. \u201cLook, I only\nwork here, Governor.\u201d\nShe faced Micah at last. She was wearing athletic clothes: leggings and\na long-sleeved white T-shirt. Her neon-pink sneakers shone like firstlight in\nthe dim library.\n\u201cRun,\u201d Flynn urged to the screen, as if Bryce could hear him. \u201cFucking\nrun, Bryce.\u201d\nSandriel glared at the Fae warrior. \u201cYou dare accuse a Governor of foul\nplay?\u201d But doubt shone in her eyes.\nThe Fae lord ignored her, his eyes again on the screens.\nHunt couldn\u2019t move. Not as Bryce set down the cheese platter, the\nwine, and said to Micah, \u201cYou came here looking for me, and here I am.\u201d A\nhalf smile. \u201cThat Summit must have been a real bore.\u201d She crossed her arms\nbehind her back, the portrait of casualness. She winked. \u201cAre you going to\nask me out again?\u201d\nMicah didn\u2019t see the angle of the second feed that Declan pulled up\u2014\nhow her fingers began flicking behind her back. Pointing to the stairs. A\nsilent, frantic order to Lehabah and Syrinx to flee. Neither moved.\n\u201cAs you once said to me,\u201d Micah replied smoothly, \u201cI\u2019m not\ninterested.\u201d\n\u201cToo bad.\u201d Silence throbbed in the conference room.\nBryce gestured again behind her back, her fingers shaking now.\nPlease, those hands seemed to say. Please run. While he\u2019s distracted by me.\n\u201cHave a seat,\u201d Micah said, gesturing to the chair across the table. \u201cWe\nmight as well be civilized about it.\u201d\nBryce obeyed, batting her eyelashes. \u201cAbout what?\u201d\n\u201cAbout you giving me Luna\u2019s Horn.\u201d"}, "77": {"Name": "PART IV THE RAVINE-Chapter 77", "Page Content": " 7 \nBryce knew there was little chance of this ending well.\nBut if Jesiba had seen her messages, maybe it wouldn\u2019t be in vain.\nMaybe everyone would know what had happened to her. Maybe they could\nsave the books, if the protective spells on them held out against an\nArchangel\u2019s wrath. Even if the gallery\u2019s enchantments had not.\nBryce said smoothly to Micah, \u201cI have no idea where the Horn is.\u201d\nHis smile didn\u2019t waver. \u201cTry again.\u201d\n\u201cI have no idea where the Horn is, Governor?\u201d\nHe braced his powerful forearms on the table. \u201cDo you want to know\nwhat I think?\u201d\n\u201cNo, but you\u2019re going to tell me anyway?\u201d Her heart raced and raced.\nMicah chuckled. \u201cI think you figured it out. Likely at the same\nmoment I did a few days ago.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m flattered you think I\u2019m that smart.\u201d\n\u201cNot you.\u201d Another cold laugh. \u201cDanika Fendyr was the smart one.\nShe stole the Horn from the temple, and you knew her well enough to\nfinally realize what she did with it.\u201d\n\u201cWhy would Danika have ever wanted the Horn?\u201d Bryce asked\ninnocently. \u201cIt\u2019s broken.\u201d\n\u201cIt was cleaved. And I\u2019m guessing you already learned what could\nrepair it at last.\u201d Her heart thundered as Micah growled, \u201cSynth.\u201d\nShe got to her feet, her knees shaking only slightly. \u201cGovernor or not,\nthis is private property. If you want to burn me at the stake with all these\nbooks, you\u2019ll need a warrant.\u201d\nBryce reached the steps. Syrinx and Lehabah hadn\u2019t moved, though.\n\u201cHand over the Horn.\u201d\n\u201cI told you, I don\u2019t know where it is.\u201d\nShe put one foot on the steps, and then Micah was there, his hand at\nthe collar of her shirt. He hissed, \u201cDo not lie.\u201d\nHunt staggered all of one step down the stairs before Sandriel stopped him,\nher wind shoving him back against the wall. It snaked down his throat,\nclamping on to his vocal cords. Rendering him silent to watch what\nunfolded on the screens.\nMicah growled in Bryce\u2019s ear, more animal than angel, \u201cDo you want\nto know how I figured it out?\u201d\nShe trembled as the Governor ran a possessive hand down the curve of\nher spine.\nHunt saw red at that touch, the entitlement in it, the sheer dread that\nwidened her eyes.\nBryce wasn\u2019t stupid enough to try to run as Micah ran his fingers back\nup her spine, intent in every stroke.\nHunt\u2019s jaw clenched so hard it hurt, his breath coming out in great,\nbellowing pants. He\u2019d kill him. He\u2019d find a way to get free of Sandriel, and\nfucking kill Micah for that touch\u2014\nMicah trailed his fingers over the delicate chain of her necklace. A new\none, Hunt realized.\nMicah purred, unaware of the camera mere feet away, \u201cI saw the\nfootage of you in the Comitium lobby. You gave your Archesian amulet to\nSandriel. And she destroyed it.\u201d His broad hand clamped around her neck,\nand Bryce squeezed her eyes shut. \u201cThat\u2019s how I realized. How you realized\nthe truth, too.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Bryce whispered.\nMicah\u2019s hand tightened, and it might as well have been his hand on\nHunt\u2019s throat for all the difficulty he had breathing. \u201cFor three years, you\nwore that amulet. Every single day, every single hour. Danika knew that.\nKnew you were without ambition, too, and would never have the drive to\nleave this job. And thus never take off the amulet.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re insane,\u201d Bryce managed to say.\n\u201cAm I? Then explain to me why, within an hour after you took off the\namulet, that kristallos demon attacked you.\u201d\nHunt stilled. A demon had attacked her that day? He found Ruhn\u2019s\nstare, and the prince nodded, his face deathly pale. We got to her in time\nwas all Danaan said to him, mind-to-mind.\n\u201cBad luck?\u201d Bryce tried.\nMicah didn\u2019t so much as smile, his hand still clamped on her neck.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t just have the Horn. You are the Horn.\u201d His hand again ran down\nher back. \u201cYou became its bearer the night Danika had it ground into a fine\npowder, mixed it with witch-ink, and then got you so drunk you didn\u2019t ask\nquestions when she had it tattooed onto your back.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Fury Axtar barked.\nHoly fucking gods. Hunt bared his teeth, still forbidden from speaking.\nBut Bryce said, \u201cCool as that sounds, Governor, this tattoo says\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThe language is beyond that of this world. It is the language of\nuniverses. And it spells out a direct command to activate the Horn through a\nblast of raw power upon the tattoo itself. Just as it once did for the Starborn\nPrince. You may not possess his gifts like your brother, but I believe your\nbloodline and the synth shall compensate for it when I use my power upon\nyou. To fill the tattoo\u2014to fill you\u2014with power is, in essence, to blow the\nHorn.\u201d\nBryce\u2019s nostrils flared. \u201cBlow me, asshole.\u201d She snapped her head\nback, fast enough that even Micah couldn\u2019t stop the collision of her skull\nwith his nose. He stumbled, buying her time to twist and flee\u2014\nHis hand didn\u2019t let go, though.\nAnd with a shove, her shirt ripping down the back, Micah hurled her to\nthe floor.\nHunt\u2019s shout was lodged in his throat, but Ruhn\u2019s echoed through the\nconference room as Bryce skidded across the carpet.\nLehabah screamed as Syrinx roared, and Bryce managed to snap,\n\u201cHide.\u201d\nBut the Archangel halted, surveying the woman sprawled on the floor\nbefore him.\nThe tattoo down her back. Luna\u2019s Horn contained within its dark ink.\nBryce scrambled to her feet, as if there were anywhere to go, anywhere\nto hide from the Governor and his terrible power. She made it across the\nroom, to the steps up to the mezzanine\u2014\nMicah moved fast as the wind. He wrapped a hand around her ankle\nand tossed her across the room.\nBryce\u2019s scream as she collided with the wood table and it shattered\nbeneath her was the worst sound Hunt had ever heard.\nRuhn breathed, \u201cHe\u2019s going to fucking kill her.\u201d\nBryce crawled backward through the debris of the table, blood running\nfrom her mouth as she whispered to Micah, \u201cYou killed Danika and the\npack.\u201d\nMicah smiled. \u201cI enjoyed every second of it.\u201d\nThe conference room shook. Or maybe that was just Hunt himself.\nAnd then the Archangel was upon her, and Hunt couldn\u2019t bear it, the\nsight of him grabbing Bryce by the neck and throwing her across the room\nagain, into those shelves.\n\u201cWhere is the fucking Aux?\u201d Ruhn screamed at Flynn. At Sabine.\nBut her eyes were wide. Stunned.\nSo slowly, Bryce crawled backward, up the mezzanine stairs again,\nclawing at the books to heave herself along. A gash leaked blood onto her\nleggings, bone gleaming beneath a protruding shard of wood. She panted,\nhalf sobbing, \u201cWhy?\u201d\nLehabah had crept to the metal bathroom door in the back of the\nlibrary and managed to open it, as if silently signaling Bryce to get there\u2014\nso they could lock themselves inside until help arrived.\n\u201cDid you learn, in all your research, that I am an investor in Redner\nIndustries? That I have access to all its experiments?\u201d\n\u201cOh fuck,\u201d Isaiah said from across the pit.\n\u201cAnd did you ever learn,\u201d Micah went on, \u201cwhat Danika did for\nRedner Industries?\u201d\nBryce still crawled backward up the stairs. There was nowhere to go,\nthough. \u201cShe did part-time security work.\u201d\n\u201cIs that how she sanitized it for you?\u201d He smirked. \u201cDanika tracked\ndown the people that Redner wanted her to find. People who didn\u2019t want to\nbe found. Including a group of Ophion rebels who had been experimenting\nwith a formula for synthetic magic\u2014to assist in the humans\u2019 treachery.\nThey\u2019d dug into long-forgotten history and learned that the kristallos\ndemons\u2019 venom nullified magic\u2014our magic. So these clever rebels decided\nto look into why, isolating the proteins that were targeted by that venom.\nThe source of magic. Redner\u2019s human spies tipped him off, and out Danika\nwent to bring in the research\u2014and the people behind it.\u201d\nBryce gasped for breath, still slowly crawling upward. No one spoke in\nthe conference room as she said, \u201cThe Asteri don\u2019t approve of synthetic\nmagic. How did Redner even get away with doing the research on it?\u201d\nHunt shook. She was buying herself time.\nMicah seemed all too happy to indulge her. \u201cBecause Redner knew the\nAsteri would shut down any synthetic magic research, that I would shut\ntheir experiments down, they spun synth experiments as a drug for healing.\nRedner invited me to invest. The earliest trials were a success: with it,\nhumans could heal faster than with any medwitch or Fae power. But later\ntrials did not go according to plan. Vanir, we learned, went out of their\nminds when given it. And humans who took too much synth \u2026 well.\nDanika used her security clearance to steal footage of the trials\u2014and I\nsuspect she left it for you, didn\u2019t she?\u201d\nBurning Solas. Up and up, Bryce crawled along the stairs, fingers\nscrabbling over those ancient, precious books. \u201cHow did she learn what you\nwere really up to?\u201d\n\u201cShe always stuck her nose where it didn\u2019t belong. Always wanting to\nprotect the meek.\u201d\n\u201cFrom monsters like you,\u201d Bryce spat, still inching upward. Still\nbuying herself time.\nMicah\u2019s smile was hideous. \u201cShe made no secret that she kept an eye\non the synth trials, because she was keen to find a way to help her weak,\nvulnerable, half-human friend. You, who would inherit no power\u2014she\nwondered if it might give you a fighting chance against the predators who\nrule this world. And when she saw the horrors the synth could bring about,\nshe became concerned for the test subjects. Concerned for what it\u2019d do to\nhumans if it leaked into the world. But Redner\u2019s employees said Danika had\nher own research there, too. No one knew what, but she spent time in their\nlabs outside of her own duties.\u201d\nAll of it had to be on the flash drive Bryce had found. Hunt prayed\nshe\u2019d put it somewhere safe. Wondered what other bombshells might be on\nit.\nBryce said, \u201cShe was never selling the synth on that boat, was she?\u201d\n\u201cNo. By that point, I\u2019d realized I needed someone with unrestricted\naccess to the temple to take the Horn\u2014I would be too easily noticed. So\nwhen she stole the synth trial footage, I had my chance to use her.\u201d\nBryce made it up another step. \u201cYou dumped the synth into the\nstreets.\u201d\nMicah kept trailing her. \u201cYes. I knew Danika\u2019s constant need to be the\nhero would send her running after it, to save the low-lifes of Lunathion\nfrom destroying themselves with it. She got most of it, but not all. When I\ntold her I\u2019d seen her on the river, when I claimed no one would believe the\nParty Princess was trying to get drugs off the streets, her hands were tied. I\ntold her I\u2019d forget about it, if she did one little favor for me, at just the right\nmoment.\u201d\n\u201cYou caused the blackout that night she stole the Horn.\u201d\n\u201cI did. But I underestimated Danika. She\u2019d been wary of my interest in\nthe synth long before I leaked it onto the streets, and when I blackmailed\nher into stealing the Horn, she must have realized the connection between\nthe two. That the Horn could be repaired by synth.\u201d\n\u201cSo you killed her for it?\u201d Another step, another question to buy\nherself time.\n\u201cI killed her because she hid the Horn before I could repair it with the\nsynth. And thus help my people.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d think your power alone would be enough for that,\u201d Bryce said, as\nif trying flattery to save herself.\nThe Archangel looked truly sad for a moment. \u201cEven my power is not\nenough to help them. To keep war from Valbara\u2019s shores. For that, I need\nhelp from beyond our own world. The Horn will open a portal\u2014and allow\nme to summon an army to decimate the human rebels and end their wanton\ndestruction.\u201d\n\u201cWhat world?\u201d Bryce asked, blanching. \u201cHel?\u201d\n\u201cHel would resist kneeling to me. But ancient lore whispers of other\nworlds that exist that would bow to a power like mine\u2014and bow to the\nHorn.\u201d He smiled, cold as a deep-sea fish. \u201cThe one who possesses the\nHorn at full power can do anything. Perhaps establish oneself as an Asteri.\u201d\n\u201cTheir power is born, not made,\u201d Bryce snapped, even as her face\nturned ashen.\n\u201cWith the Horn, you would not need to inherit a star\u2019s might to rule.\nAnd the Asteri would recognize that. Welcome me as one of them.\u201d Another\nsoft laugh.\n\u201cYou killed those two CCU students.\u201d\n\u201cNo. They were slaughtered by a satyr high on synth\u2014while Danika\nwas busy stealing the Horn that night. I\u2019m sure the guilt of it ate her up.\u201d\nBryce was shaking. Hunt was, too. \u201cSo you went to the apartment and\nkilled her and the Pack of Devils?\u201d\n\u201cI waited until Philip Briggs was released.\u201d\nShe murmured, \u201cHe had the black salt in his lab that would incriminate\nhim.\u201d\n\u201cYes. Once he was again on the streets, I went to Danika\u2019s apartment\n\u2014your apartment\u2014disabled the Pack of Devils with my power, and\ninjected her with the synth. And watched as she ripped them apart before\nturning on herself.\u201d\nBryce was crying in earnest now. \u201cShe didn\u2019t tell you, though. Where\nthe Horn was.\u201d\nMicah shrugged. \u201cShe held out.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what\u2014you summoned the kristallos afterward to cover your\ntracks? Let it attack you in the alley to keep your triarii from suspecting\nyou? Or just to give yourself a reason to monitor this case so closely\nwithout raising any eyebrows? And then you waited two fucking years?\u201d\nHe frowned. \u201cI have spent these past two years looking for the Horn,\ncalling kristallos demons to track it down for me, but I couldn\u2019t find a trace\nof it. Until I realized I didn\u2019t have to do the legwork. Because you, Bryce\nQuinlan, were the key to finding the Horn. I knew Danika had hidden it\nsomewhere, and you, if I gave you a chance for vengeance, would lead me\nto it. All my power couldn\u2019t find it, but you\u2014you loved her. And the power\nof your love would bring the Horn to me. Would fuel your need for justice\nand lead you right to it.\u201d He snorted. \u201cBut there was a chance you might not\nget that far\u2014not alone. So I planted a seed in the mind of the Autumn\nKing.\u201d\nEveryone in the room looked to the stone-faced Fae male.\nRuhn growled at his father, \u201cHe played you like a fucking fiddle.\u201d\nThe Autumn King\u2019s amber eyes flashed with white-hot rage. But\nMicah went on before he could speak. \u201cI knew a bit of taunting about the\nFae\u2019s waning power, about the loss of the Horn, would rankle his pride just\nenough for him to order his Starborn son to look for it.\u201d\nBryce let out a long breath. \u201cSo if I couldn\u2019t find it, then Ruhn might.\u201d\nRuhn blinked. \u201cI\u2014every time I went to look for the Horn \u2026\u201d He\npaled. \u201cI always had the urge to go to Bryce.\u201d He twisted in his seat to meet\nHunt\u2019s stare and said to him mind-to-mind, I thought it was the gallery,\nsome knowledge in there, but \u2026 fuck, it was her.\nYour Starborn connection to her and the Horn must have overcome\neven the masking power of the Archesian amulet, Hunt answered. That\u2019s\nquite a bond, Prince.\nBryce demanded, \u201cAnd summoning the kristallos these months? The\nmurders?\u201d\nMicah drawled, \u201cI summoned the kristallos to nudge you both along,\nmaking sure it kept just enough out of camera range, knowing its\nconnection to the Horn would lead you toward it. Injecting Tertian, the\nacolyte, and the temple guard with the synth\u2014letting them rip themselves\napart\u2014was also to prompt you. Tertian, to give us an excuse to come to you\nfor this investigation, and the others to keep pointing you toward the Horn. I\ntargeted two people from the temple that were on duty the night Danika\nstole it.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the bombing at the White Raven, with an image of the Horn on\nthe crate? Another nudge?\u201d\n\u201cYes, and to raise suspicions that humans were behind everything. I\nplanted bombs throughout the city, in places I thought you might go. When\nAthalar\u2019s phone location pinged at the club, I knew the gods were helping\nme along. So I remotely detonated it.\u201d\n\u201cI could have died.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe. But I was willing to bet Athalar would shield you. And why\nnot cause a little chaos, to stir more resentment between the humans and\nVanir? It would only make it easier to convince others of the wisdom of my\nplan to end this conflict. Especially at a cost most would deem too high.\u201d\nHunt\u2019s head swam. No one in the room spoke.\nBryce slowed her retreat as she winced in pain, \u201cAnd the apartment\nbuilding? I thought it was Hunt, but it wasn\u2019t, was it? It was you.\u201d\n\u201cYes. Your landlord\u2019s request went to all of my triarii. And to me. I\nknew Danika had left nothing there. But by that time, Bryce Quinlan, I was\nenjoying watching you squirm. I knew Athalar\u2019s plan to acquire the synth\nwould soon be exposed\u2014and I took a guess that you\u2019d be willing to believe\nthe worst of him. That he\u2019d used the lightning in his veins to endanger\ninnocent people. He\u2019s a killer. I thought you might need a reminder. That it\nplayed into Athalar\u2019s guilt was an unexpected boon.\u201d\nHunt ignored the eyes that glanced his way. The fucking asshole had\nnever planned to honor his bargain. If he\u2019d solved the case, Micah would\nhave killed him. Killed them both. He\u2019d been played like a fucking fool.\nBryce asked, voice raw, \u201cWhen did you start to think it was me?\u201d\n\u201cThat night it attacked Athalar in the garden. I realized only later that\nhe\u2019d probably come into contact with one of Danika\u2019s personal items,\nwhich must have come into contact with the Horn.\u201d\nHunt had touched Danika\u2019s leather jacket that day. Gotten its scent on\nhim.\n\u201cOnce I got Athalar off the streets, I summoned the kristallos again\u2014\nand it went right to you. The only thing that had changed was that you\nfinally, finally took that amulet off. And then \u2026\u201d He chuckled. \u201cI looked at\nHunt Athalar\u2019s photos of your time together. Including that one of your\nback. The tattoo you had inked there, days before Danika\u2019s death, according\nto the list of Danika\u2019s last locations Ruhn Danaan sent to you and Athalar\u2014\nwhose account is easily accessible to me.\u201d\nBryce\u2019s fingers curled into the carpet, as if she\u2019d sprout claws. \u201cHow\ndo you know the Horn will even work now that it\u2019s in my back?\u201d\n\u201cThe Horn\u2019s physical shape doesn\u2019t matter. Whether it is fashioned as\na horn or a necklace or a powder mixed with witch-ink, its power remains.\u201d\nHunt silently swore. He and Bryce had never visited the tattoo parlor.\nBryce had said she knew why Danika was there.\nMicah went on, \u201cDanika knew the Archesian amulet would hide you\nfrom any detection, magical or demonic. With that amulet, you were\ninvisible to the kristallos, bred to hunt the Horn. I suspect she knew that\nJesiba Roga has similar enchantments upon this gallery, and perhaps Danika\nplaced some upon your apartments\u2014your old one and the one she left to\nyou\u2014to make sure you would be even more veiled from it.\u201d\nHunt scanned the gallery camera feeds from the street. Where the fuck\nwas the Aux?\nBryce spat, \u201cAnd you thought no one would figure this out? What\nabout Briggs\u2019s testimony?\u201d\n\u201cBriggs is a raving fanatic who\u2019d been caught by Danika before a\nplanned bombing. No one would listen to his pleas of innocence.\u201d\nEspecially when his lawyer had been provided by Micah.\nBryce glanced up at the camera. As if checking that it was on.\nSabine whispered, \u201cShe\u2019s been leading him along to get a full\nconfession.\u201d\nDespite the terror tightening his body, pride flared through Hunt.\nMicah smiled again. \u201cSo here we are.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a piece of shit,\u201d Bryce said.\nBut then Micah reached into his jacket pocket. Pulled out a needle.\nFull of clear liquid. \u201cCalling me names isn\u2019t going to stop me from using\nthe Horn.\u201d\nHunt\u2019s breath sawed through his chest.\nMicah advanced on her. \u201cThe Horn\u2019s remnants are now embedded in\nyour flesh. When I inject you with synth, the healing properties in it will\ntarget and fix whatever it finds to be broken. And the Horn will again be\nwhole. Ready for me to learn if it works at last.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d risk opening a portal to another fucking world in the middle of\nCrescent City,\u201d she spat, inching farther away, \u201cjust to learn if it works?\u201d\n\u201cIf I am correct, the benefits shall far outweigh any casualties,\u201d Micah\nanswered mildly as a bead of liquid gleamed on the syringe\u2019s tip. \u201cToo bad\nyou will not survive the synth\u2019s side effects in order to see for yourself.\u201d\nBryce lunged for a book on a low-lying shelf along the stairs, but\nMicah halted her with a leash of wind.\nHer face crumpled as the Archangel knelt over her. \u201cNo.\u201d\nThis couldn\u2019t happen; Hunt couldn\u2019t let this happen.\nBut Bryce could do nothing, Hunt could do nothing, as Micah stabbed\nthe needle into her thigh. Drained it to the hilt. She screamed, thrashing, but\nMicah stepped back.\nHis power must have lessened its hold on her, because she sagged to\nthe carpeted steps.\nThe bastard glanced at the clock. Assessing how much time remained\nuntil she tore herself apart. And slowly, the wounds on her battered body\nbegan to seal. Her split lip healed fully\u2014though the bone-deep gash in her\nthigh knit far more slowly.\nSmiling, Micah reached for the tattoo on her exposed back. \u201cShall\nwe?\u201d\nBut Bryce moved again\u2014and this time Micah\u2019s power didn\u2019t catch her\nbefore she grabbed a book from the shelf and clutched it tight.\nGolden light erupted from the book, a bubble against which Micah\u2019s\nhand bounced harmlessly off.

And then Bryce was up and running.\nThe bathroom door shuddered. She didn\u2019t so much as look back as she\nsprinted, still limping, for the stairs to the tank. She grabbed a knife off the\nground. Micah\u2019s knife.\nRuhn had to remind himself to take a breath as Bryce hit the stairs,\nripping a piece from her torn shirt, wrapping it around her thigh to bind the\nknife to her. A makeshift sheath.\nDeclan switched the feed to the small chamber atop the tank, the water\nsloshing through the grated floor.

Still slowly healing. The n\u00f8kk must have dug its claws in to the\nbone if the injury was so severe the synth was still stitching it together.\nBryce said, \u201cWe have to run. Now. Before he gets out.\u201d She didn\u2019t wait\nfor Lehabah to reply as she managed to get upright, carrying Syrinx.\nShe limped\u2014badly. And she moved so, so slowly toward the stairs.\nThe bathroom door heated again, the metal red-hot as Micah attempted\nto melt his way through.\nBryce panted through her teeth, a controlled hiss-hiss-hiss with each\nstep. Trying to master the pain the synth hadn\u2019t yet taken away. Trying to\ndrag a thirty-pound chimera down a set of steps on a shredded leg.\nThe bathroom door pulsed with light, sparks flying from its cracks.\nBryce reached the library, took a limping step toward the main stairs up to\nthe showroom, and whimpered.\n\u201cLeave it,\u201d the Autumn King growled. \u201cLeave the chimera.\u201d\nHunt knew, even before Bryce took another step, that she would not.\nThat she\u2019d rather have her back peeled off by an Archangel than leave\nSyrinx behind.\nAnd he could see that Lehabah knew it, too.\nBryce was a third of the way up the stairs, sparks flying from the seams of\nthe bathroom door across the library behind them, when she realized\nLehabah was not with her.\nBryce halted, gasping around the pain in her calf that even the synth\ncould not dull, and looked back at the base of the library stairs. \u201cForget the\nbooks, Lehabah,\u201d she pleaded.\nIf they survived, she\u2019d kill Jesiba for even making the sprite hesitate.\nKill her.\nYet Lehabah did not move. \u201cLehabah,\u201d Bryce said, the name an order.\nLehabah said softly, sadly, \u201cYou won\u2019t make it in time, BB.\u201d\nBryce took one step up, pain flaring up her calf. Each movement kept\nripping it open, an uphill battle against the synth attempting to heal her.\nBefore it\u2019d rip apart her sanity. She swallowed her scream and said, \u201cWe\nhave to try.\u201d\n\u201cNot we,\u201d Lehabah whispered. \u201cYou.\u201d\nBryce felt her face drain of any remaining color. \u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d Her\nvoice cracked.\n\u201cI can,\u201d Lehabah said. \u201cThe enchantments won\u2019t hold him much\nlonger. Let me buy you time.\u201d\nBryce kept moving, gritting her teeth. \u201cWe can figure this out. We can\nget out together\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nBryce looked back to find Lehabah smiling softly. Still at the base of\nthe stairs. \u201cLet me do this for you, BB. For you, and for Syrinx.\u201d\nBryce couldn\u2019t stop the sob that wrenched its way out of her. \u201cYou\u2019re\nfree, Lehabah.\u201d\nThe words rippled through the library as Bryce wept. \u201cI traded with\nJesiba for your freedom last week. I have the papers in my desk. I wanted to\nthrow a party for it\u2014to surprise you.\u201d The bathroom door began warping,\nbending. Bryce sobbed, \u201cI bought you, and now I set you free, Lehabah.\u201d\nLehabah\u2019s smile didn\u2019t falter. \u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cI peeked in your\ndrawer.\u201d\nAnd despite the monster trying to break loose behind them, Bryce\nchoked on a laugh before she begged, \u201cYou are a free person\u2014you do not\nhave to do this. You are free, Lehabah.\u201d\nYet Lehabah remained at the foot of the stairs. \u201cThen let the world\nknow that my first act of freedom was to help my friends.\u201d\nSyrinx shifted in Bryce\u2019s arms, a low, pained sound breaking from\nhim. Bryce thought it might be the sound her own soul was making as she\nwhispered, unable to bear this choice, this moment, \u201cI love you, Lehabah.\u201d\nThe only words that ever mattered.\n\u201cAnd I will love you always, BB.\u201d The fire sprite breathed, \u201cGo.\u201d\nSo Bryce did. Gritting her teeth, a scream breaking from her, Bryce\nheaved herself and Syrinx up the stairs. Toward the iron door at the top.\nAnd whatever time it\u2019d buy them, if the synth didn\u2019t destroy her first.\nThe bathroom door groaned.\nBryce glanced back\u2014just once. To the friend who had stayed by her\nwhen no one else had. Who had refused to be anything but cheerful, even in\nthe face of the darkness that had swallowed Bryce whole.\nLehabah burned a deep, unfaltering ruby and began to move.\nFirst, a sweep of her arm upward. Then an arc down. A twirl, hair\nspiraling above her head. A dance, to summon her power. Whatever kernel\nof it a fire sprite might have.\nA glow spread along Lehabah\u2019s body.\nSo Bryce climbed. And with each painful step upward, she could hear\nLehabah whisper, almost chanting, \u201cI am a descendant of Ranthia Drahl,\nQueen of Embers. She is with me now and I am not afraid.\u201d\nBryce reached the top of the stairs.\nLehabah whispered, \u201cMy friends are behind me, and I will protect\nthem.\u201d\nScreaming, Bryce shoved the library door. Until it clanged shut, the\nenchantments sealing, cutting off Lehabah\u2019s voice with it, and Bryce leaned\nagainst it, sliding to the floor as she sobbed through her teeth.\nBryce had made it up to the showroom and locked the iron door behind her.\nThank the gods for that\u2014thank the fucking gods.\nYet Hunt couldn\u2019t take his eyes off the library feed, where Lehabah\nstill moved, still summoned her power, repeating the words over and over:\n\u201cI am a descendant of Ranthia Drahl, Queen of Embers. She is with me\nnow and I am not afraid.\u201d\nLehabah glowed, bright as the heart of a star.\n\u201cMy friends are behind me, and I will protect them.\u201d\nThe top of the bathroom door began to curl open.\nAnd Lehabah unleashed her power. Three blows. Perfectly aimed.\nNot to the bathroom door and Archangel behind it. No, Lehabah\ncouldn\u2019t slow Micah.\nBut a hundred thousand gallons of water would.\nLehabah\u2019s shimmering blasts of power slammed into the glass tank.\nRight on top of the crack that Bryce had made when the n\u00f8kk threw her into\nit.\nThe creature, sensing the commotion, rose from the rocks. And\nrecoiled in horror as Lehabah struck again. Again. The glass cracked\nfurther.\nAnd then Lehabah hurled herself against it. Pushed her tiny body\nagainst the crack.\nShe kept whispering the words over and over again. They morphed\ntogether into one sentence, a prayer, a challenge.\n\u201cMy friends are with me and I am not afraid.\u201d\nHunt wrested control of his body enough that he was able to put a hand\nover his heart. The only salute he could make as Lehabah\u2019s words\nwhispered through the speakers.\n\u201cMy friends are with me and I am not afraid.\u201d\nOne by one, the angels in the 33rd rose to their feet. Then Ruhn and\nhis friends. And they, too, put their hands on their hearts as the smallest of\ntheir House pushed and pushed against the glass wall, burning gold as the\nn\u00f8kk tried to flee to any place it might survive what was about to come.\nOver and over, Lehabah whispered, \u201cMy friends are with me and I am\nnot afraid.\u201d\nThe glass spiderwebbed.\nEveryone in the conference room rose to their feet. Only Sandriel, her\nattention fixed on the screen, did not notice. They all stood, and bore\nwitness to the sprite who brought her death down upon herself, upon the\nn\u00f8kk\u2014to save her friends. It was all they could offer her, this final respect\nand honor.\nLehabah still pushed. Still shook with terror. Yet she did not stop. Not\nfor one heartbeat.\n\u201cMy friends are with me and I am not afraid.\u201d\nThe bathroom door tore open, metal curling aside to reveal Micah,\nglowing as if newly forged, as if he\u2019d rend this world apart. He surveyed the\nlibrary, eyes landing on Lehabah and the cracked tank wall.\nThe sprite whirled, back pressed against the glass. She hissed at\nMicah, \u201cThis is for Syrinx.\u201d\nShe slammed her little burning palm into the glass.\nAnd a hundred thousand gallons of water exploded into the library."}, "80": {"Name": "PART IV THE RAVINE-Chapter 80", "Page Content": " 0 \nFlashing red lights erupted, casting the world into flickering color.

Wouldn\u2019t watch it.\nMicah\u2019s power rumbled in the library. Parted the water as he plowed\nacross the space.\nBryce grabbed the four parts of the Godslayer Rifle mounted on the\nwall and chucked them onto the desk. Unlocked the safe door and reached\ninside. She pulled out a glass vial and knocked back some sort of potion\u2014\nanother drug? Who knew what the sorceress kept in there?\u2014and then\npulled out a slender golden bullet.\nIt was six inches long, its surface engraved with a grinning, winged\nskull on one side. On the other, two simple words:\nMemento Mori.\nRemember that you will die. They now seemed more of a promise than\nthe mild reminder from the Meat Market.\nBryce clenched the bullet between her teeth as she hauled the first\npiece of the rifle toward her. Fitted the second.\nMicah surged up the stairs, death incarnate.\nBryce whirled toward the open interior window. She threw out a hand,\nand the third piece of the rifle\u2014the barrel\u2014flew from the desk into her\nsplayed fingers, borne on magic she did not naturally possess, thanks to the\nsynth coursing through her veins. A few movements had her locking it into\nplace.\nShe ran for the shattered window, assembling the rifle as she went,\nsummoning the final piece from the desk on an invisible wind, that golden\nbullet still clenched in her teeth.\nHunt had never seen anyone assemble a gun without looking at it,\nrunning toward a target. As if she had done it a thousand times.\nShe had, Hunt remembered.\nBryce might have been fathered by the Autumn King, but she was\nRandall Silago\u2019s daughter. And the legendary sharpshooter had taught her\nwell.\nBryce clicked the last piece into place and dropped into a slide, finally\nloading the bullet. She careened into a stop before the gaping window,\nrising onto her knees as she braced the Godslayer against her shoulder.\nAnd in the two seconds it took Bryce to line up her shot, in the two\nseconds it took for her to loose a steadying breath, Hunt knew those\nseconds were Lehabah\u2019s. Knew that\u2019s what the sprite\u2019s life had bought her\nfriend. What Lehabah had offered to Bryce, and Bryce had accepted,\nunderstanding.\nNot a chance to run. No, there would never be any escaping Micah.\nLehabah had offered Bryce the two extra seconds needed to kill an\nArchangel.\nMicah exploded out of the iron door. Metal embedded in the wood\npaneling of the gallery. The Governor whirled toward the open front door.\nTo the trap Bryce had laid in opening it.\nSo he wouldn\u2019t look up. So he didn\u2019t have time to even glance in\nBryce\u2019s direction before her finger curled on the trigger.\nAnd she shot that bullet right through Micah\u2019s fucking head."}, "81": {"Name": "PART IV THE RAVINE-Chapter 81", "Page Content": " 1 \nTime warped and stretched.\nHunt had the distinct feeling of falling backward, even though he was\nalready against a wall and hadn\u2019t so much as moved a muscle.\nYet the coffee in the mug on the nearest table tilted, the liquid\nendlessly rocking, rocking, rocking to one side\u2014 The death of an\nArchangel, of a world power, could shudder through time and space. A\nsecond could last an hour. A day. A year.\nSo Hunt saw everything. Saw the endlessly slow movements of\neveryone in the room, the gaping shock that rippled, Sandriel\u2019s outrage,\nPollux\u2019s white-faced disbelief, Ruhn\u2019s terror\u2014 The Godslayer bullet was\nstill burrowing through Micah\u2019s skull. Still twisting through bone and brain\nmatter, dragging time in its wake.\nThen Bryce stood at the office\u2019s blown-out window. A sword in both\nhands.\nDanika\u2019s sword\u2014she must have left it in the gallery on her last day\nalive. And Bryce must have stashed it in Jesiba\u2019s office, where it had stayed\nhidden for two years. Hunt saw every minute expression on Sabine\u2019s face,\nthe widening of her pupils, the flow of her corn-silk hair as she reeled at the\nsight of the missing heirloom\u2014 Bryce leapt from the window and into the\nshowroom below. Hunt saw each movement of her body, arcing as she\nraised the sword above her head, then brought it back down as she fell.\nHe could have sworn the ancient steel cut the very air itself. And then\nit cut through Micah.\nSliced his head in two as Bryce drove it through, the sword cleaving a\npath into his body. Peeling him apart. Only Danika\u2019s sword would do for\nthis task.\nHunt savored these final moments of her life, before the synth took\nover. Was this the first sign of it\u2014this madness, this pure, frenzied rage?\nBryce. His Bryce. His friend and \u2026 everything they had that was more\nthan that. She was his and he was hers, and he should have told her that,\nshould have told her in the Comitium lobby that she was the only person\nwho mattered, who would ever matter to him, and he\u2019d find her again, even\nif it took him a thousand years, he\u2019d find her and do everything Sandriel\nhad mocked him about.\nBryce still leapt, still kept cutting through Micah\u2019s body. His blood\nrained upward.\nIn normal time, it would have splattered. But in this warped existence,\nthe Archangel\u2019s blood rose like ruby bubbles, showering Bryce\u2019s face,\nfilling her screaming mouth.\nIn this warped existence, he could see the synth heal every sliced,\nbruised place on Bryce as she cut her way down through Micah. Cut him in\nhalf.\nShe landed on the green carpet. Hunt expected to hear bone cracking.\nBut her calf was wholly healed. The last gift of the synth before it destroyed\nher. Yet in her eyes \u2026 he saw no haze of insanity, of self-destructive frenzy.\nOnly cold, glittering vengeance.\nThe two halves of Micah\u2019s body fell away from each other and Bryce\nmoved again. Another swipe. Across his torso. And then another to his\nhead.\nThe red alarm lights were still blaring, but there was no mistaking the\nblood on Bryce. The white shirt that was now crimson. Her eyes remained\nclear, though. Still the synth did not take control.\nHypaxia murmured, \u201cThe antidote is working. It\u2019s working on her.\u201d\nHunt swayed then. He said to the witch, \u201cI thought you were only\nsending over the venom.\u201d\nHypaxia didn\u2019t take her eyes off the screen. \u201cI figured out how to\nstabilize the venom without needing to be present, and\u2014I sent the antidote\nto her instead. Just \u2026 just in case.\u201d\nAnd they\u2019d watched Bryce down it like a bottle of whiskey.\nIt had taken almost three minutes for the antidote to wholly destroy the\nsynth in Hypaxia\u2019s clinic. Neither Hunt nor the witch-queen took their eyes\noff Bryce long enough to count the minutes until the synth had vanished\nfrom her body entirely.\nBryce walked calmly to the hidden supply closet. Pulled out a red\nplastic container. And dumped the entire gallon of gasoline on the\nGovernor\u2019s dismembered corpse.\n\u201cHoly fuck,\u201d Ruhn whispered, over and over. \u201cHoly fuck.\u201d\nThe rest of the room didn\u2019t so much as breathe too loudly. Even\nSandriel had no words as Bryce grabbed a pack of matches from a drawer\nin her desk.\nShe struck one, and tossed it onto the Governor\u2019s body.\nFlames erupted. The fireproofing enchantments on the art around her\nshimmered.\nThere would be no chance of salvation. Of healing. Not for Micah. Not\nafter what he had done to Danika Fendyr. To the Pack of Devils. And\nLehabah.\nBryce stared at the fire, her face still splattered with the Archangel\u2019s\nblood. And finally, she lifted her eyes. Right to the camera. To the world\nwatching.\nVengeance incarnate. Wrath\u2019s bruised heart. She would bow for no\none. Hunt\u2019s lightning sang at the sight of that brutal, beautiful face.\nTime sped up, the flames devouring Micah\u2019s body, crisping his wings\nto cinders. They spat him out as ashes.\nSirens wailed outside the gallery as the Auxiliary pulled up at last.\nBryce slammed the front door shut as the first of the Fae units and\nwolf packs appeared.\nNo one, not even Sandriel, spoke a word as Bryce took out the vacuum\nfrom the supply closet. And erased the last trace of Micah from the world."}, "82": {"Name": "PART IV THE RAVINE-Chapter 82", "Page Content": " 2 \nA gas explosion, she told the Aux through the intercom, who apparently\nhadn\u2019t been informed of the details by their superiors. She was fine. Just a\nprivate mess to deal with.\nNo mention of the Archangel. Of the ashes she\u2019d vacuumed, then\ndumped in the bin out back.\nShe\u2019d gone up to Jesiba\u2019s office afterward, to hold Syrinx, stroking his\nfur, kissing his still-damp head, whispering repeatedly, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. You\u2019re\nokay.\u201d\nHe\u2019d eventually fallen asleep in her lap, and when she\u2019d assured\nherself that his breathing was unlabored, she\u2019d finally pulled her phone\nfrom the pocket in the back of her leggings.\nShe had seven missed calls, all from Jesiba. And a string of messages.\nShe barely comprehended the earlier ones, but the one that had arrived a\nminute ago said, Tell me that you are all right.\nHer fingers were distant, her blood pounded in her ears. But she wrote\nback, Fine. Did you see what happened?\nJesiba\u2019s reply came a moment later.\nYes. The entire thing. Then the sorceress added, Everyone at the\nSummit did.\nBryce just wrote back, Good.\nShe put her phone on silent, tucking it back in her pocket, and ventured\ndown to the watery ruin of the archives.\nThere was no trace of Lehabah in the mostly submerged library. Not\neven a smudge of ash.\nThe n\u00f8kk\u2019s corpse lay sprawled on the mezzanine, its dried-out skin\nflaking away, one clawed hand still gripping the iron bars of the balcony\nrail.\nJesiba had enough spells on the library that the books and the small\ntanks and terrariums had been shielded from the wave, though their\noccupants were near-frantic, but the building itself \u2026\nThe silence roared around her.\nLehabah was gone. There was no voice at her shoulder, grousing about\nthe mess.\nAnd Danika \u2026 She tucked away the truth Micah had revealed. The\nHorn on her back, healed and functional again. She felt no different\u2014\nwouldn\u2019t have known it was awake were it not for the horrific blast the\nArchangel had unleashed. At least a portal hadn\u2019t opened. At least she had\nthat.\nShe knew the world was coming. It would arrive on her doorstep soon.\nAnd she might very well burn for what she\u2019d just done.\nSo Bryce trudged back upstairs. Her leg was healed. Every ache was\ngone; the synth was cleansed from her system\u2014\nBryce puked into the trash can beside her desk. The venom in the\nantidote had burned as fiercely as it had gone down, but she didn\u2019t stop. Not\nuntil there was nothing left but spittle.\nShe should call someone. Anyone.\nStill, the doorbell did not ring. No one came to punish her for what\nshe\u2019d done. Syrinx was still sleeping, curled into a tight ball. Bryce crossed\nthe gallery and opened the door for the world.\nIt was then that she heard the screaming. She grabbed Syrinx and ran\ntoward it.\nAnd when she arrived, she realized why no one had come for her, or\nfor the Horn inked in her flesh.\nThey had far bigger problems to deal with.\nChaos reigned at the Summit. The Asterian Guard had flown off,\npresumably to get instructions from their masters, and Sandriel just gaped at\nthe feed that had shown Bryce Quinlan casually vacuuming up the ashes of\na Governor as if she\u2019d spilled chips on the carpet.\nShe was distracted enough that Hunt was able to finally move. He slid\ninto the empty seat beside Ruhn and Flynn. His voice was low. \u201cThis just\nwent from bad to worse.\u201d\nIndeed, the Autumn King had Declan Emmet and two other techs on\nsix different computers, monitoring everything from the gallery to the news\nto the movements of the Aux through the city. Tristan Flynn was again on\nhis phone, arguing with someone in the Fae command post.\nRuhn rubbed his face. \u201cThey\u2019ll kill her for this.\u201d\nFor murdering a Governor. For proving a sprite and a half-human\nwoman could take on a Governor and win. It was absurd. As likely as a\nminnow slaying a shark.\nSabine still stared at the screens, unseeing as the ancient Prime,\ncurrently dozing in his chair beside her. A tired, weary wolf ready for his\nlast slumber. Amelie Ravenscroft, still pale and shaky, handed Sabine a\nglass of water. The future Prime ignored it.\nAcross the room, Sandriel rose, a phone to her ear. She looked at none\nof them as she ascended the steps out of the pit and left, her triarii falling\ninto rank around her, Pollux already mastering himself enough to recover\nhis swagger.\nHunt\u2019s stomach churned as he wondered if Sandriel was moments\naway from being crowned Archangel of Valbara. Pollux was grinning\nwidely enough to confirm the possibility. Fuck.\nRuhn glanced at Hunt. \u201cWe need to figure out a plan, Athalar.\u201d\nFor Bryce. To somehow shield her from the fallout of this. If such a\nthing were even possible. If the Asteri weren\u2019t already moving against her,\nalready telling Sandriel what to do. To eliminate the threat Bryce had just\nmade herself into, even without the Horn inked in her back.\nAt least Micah\u2019s experiment had failed. At least they had that.\nRuhn said again, more to himself, \u201cThey\u2019ll kill her for this.\u201d\nQueen Hypaxia took a seat at Hunt\u2019s other side, giving him a warning\nlook as she held up a key. She fitted it into Hunt\u2019s manacles and the gorsian\nstones thumped to the table. \u201cI believe they have bigger issues at hand,\u201d she\nsaid, gesturing to the city cameras Declan had pulled up.\nQuiet rippled through the conference room.\n\u201cTell me that\u2019s not what I think it is,\u201d Ruhn said.\nMicah\u2019s experiment with the Horn hadn\u2019t failed at all."}, "83": {"Name": "PART IV THE RAVINE-Chapter 83", "Page Content": " 3 \nBryce took one look at the Heart Gate in the Old Square and sprinted home,\nSyrinx in her arms.\nMicah had indeed wielded the Horn successfully. And it had opened a\nportal right through the mouth of the Heart Gate, drawing upon the magic in\nits quartz walls. Bryce had taken one look at what sailed out of the void\nsuspended in the Heart Gate and knew Micah had not opened a portal to\nunknown worlds, as he\u2019d intended. This one went straight to Hel.\nPeople screamed as winged, scaled demons soared out of the Gate\u2014\ndemons from the Pit itself.\nAt her building, she yelled at Marrin to get into the basement, along\nwith any tenants he could bring with him. And to call his family, his friends,\nand warn them to get somewhere secure\u2014the bomb shelters, if they could\n\u2014and hunker down with whatever weapons were available.\nShe left Syrinx in the apartment, laid down a massive bowl of water,\nand took the lid off the food bin entirely. He could feed himself. She piled\nblankets on the couch, tucking him into them, and kissed him once on his\nfurry head before she grabbed what she needed and ran out the door again.\nShe raced to the roof, shrugging on Danika\u2019s leather jacket, then tying\nthe Fendyr family\u2019s sword across her back. She tucked one of Hunt\u2019s\nhandguns into the waist of her jeans, shouldered his rifle, and slid as many\npacks of ammo as she could into her pockets. She surveyed the city and her\nblood turned to ice. It was worse\u2014so much worse\u2014than she\u2019d imagined.\nMicah hadn\u2019t just opened a portal to Hel in the Heart Gate. He\u2019d\nopened one in every Gate. Every one of the seven quartz arches was a\ndoorway to Hel.\nScreams from below rose as the demons raced from the voids and into\nthe defenseless city.\nA siren wailed. A warning cry\u2014and an order.\nBomb shelters opened, their automatic foot-thick doors sliding aside to\nlet in those already gathered. Bryce lifted her phone to her ear.\nJuniper, for once, picked up on the first ring. \u201cOh gods, Bryce\u2014\u201d\n\u201cGet somewhere safe!\u201d\n\u201cI am, I am,\u201d Juniper sobbed. \u201cWe were having a dress rehearsal with\nsome big donors, and we\u2019re all in the shelter down the block, and\u2014\u201d\nAnother sob. \u201cBryce, they\u2019re saying they\u2019re going to shut the door early.\u201d\nHorror lurched through her. \u201cPeople need to get in. They need every\nmoment you can spare.\u201d\nJuniper wept. \u201cI told them that, but they\u2019re frantic and won\u2019t listen.\nThey won\u2019t let humans in.\u201d\n\u201cFucking bastards,\u201d Bryce breathed, studying the shelter still open\ndown her block\u2014the people streaming inside. The shelters could be shut\nmanually at any time, but all would close within an hour. Sealed until the\nthreat was dealt with.\nJuniper\u2019s voice crackled. \u201cI\u2019ll make them hold the doors. But Bryce,\nit\u2019s\u2014\u201d Reception cut out as she presumably moved farther into the shelter,\nand Bryce glanced northward, toward the theaters. Mere blocks from the\nHeart Gate. \u201cMess of\u2014\u201d Another crackle. \u201cSafe?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m safe,\u201d Bryce lied. \u201cStay in the shelter. Hold the doors for as long\nas you can.\u201d\nBut Juniper, sweet and determined and brave, wouldn\u2019t be able to calm\na panicked crowd. Especially one draped in finery\u2014and convinced of their\nright to live at the expense of all others.\nJuniper\u2019s voice crackled again, so Bryce just said, \u201cI love you, June.\u201d\nAnd hung up.\nShe fired off a message to Jesiba about the literal Hel being unleashed,\nand when she received no instantaneous reply, added another saying that\nshe was heading out into it. Because someone had to.\nDemons soared into the skies from the Moonwood Gate. Bryce could\nonly pray the Den had gone into lockdown already. But the Den had guards\nby the dozen and powerful enchantments. Parts of this city had no\nprotection at all.\nIt was enough to send her sprinting for the stairs off the roof. Down\nthrough the building.\nAnd into the chaotic streets below.\n\u201cDemons are coming out of every Gate,\u201d Declan reported over the clamor\nof various leaders and their teams shouting into their phones. The Gates\nnow held black voids within their archways. As if an invisible set of doors\nhad been opened within them.\nHe could only see six of them on his screens, since the Bone Quarter\nhad no cameras, but Declan supposed he could safely assume the Dead Gate\nacross the Istros held the same darkness. Jesiba Roga made no attempt to\ncontact the Under-King, but kept her eyes fixed on the feeds. Her face was\nashen.\nIt didn\u2019t matter, Hunt thought, looking over Declan\u2019s shoulder. The\ndenizens of the Bone Quarter were already dead.\nCalls were going out\u2014many weren\u2019t being answered. Sabine barked\norders at Amelie, both of them pressing phones to their ears as they tried to\nreach the Alphas of the city packs.\nOn every screen in the conference center, cameras from around\nCrescent City revealed a land of nightmares. Hunt didn\u2019t know where to\nlook. Each new image was more awful than the last. Demons he recognized\nwith chilling clarity\u2014the worst of the worst\u2014poured into the city through\nthe Gates. Demons that had been an effort for him to kill. The people of\nLunathion didn\u2019t stand a chance.\nNot the urbane, clever demons like Aidas. No, these were the grunts.\nThe beasts of the Pit. Its wild dogs, hungry for easy prey.\nIn FiRo, the iridescent bubbles of the villas\u2019 defense enchantments\nalready gleamed. Locking out anyone poor or unlucky enough to be on the\nstreets. It was there, in front of the ironclad walls of the city\u2019s richest\ncitizens, that the Aux had been ordered to go. To protect the already safe.\nHunt snarled at Sabine, \u201cTell your packs there are defenseless homes\nwhere they\u2019re needed\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThese are the protocols,\u201d Sabine snarled back. Amelie Ravenscroft, at\nleast, had the decency to flush with shame and lower her head. But she\ndidn\u2019t dare speak out of turn.\nHunt growled, \u201cFuck the protocols.\u201d He pointed to the screens. \u201cThose\nassholes have enchantments and panic rooms in their villas. The people on\nthe streets have nothing.\u201d\nSabine ignored him. But Ruhn ordered his father, \u201cPull our forces from\nFiRo. Send them where they\u2019re needed.\u201d\nThe Autumn King\u2019s jaw worked. But he said, \u201cThe protocols are in\nplace for a reason. We will not abandon them to chaos.\u201d\nHunt demanded, \u201cAre you both fucking kidding me?\u201d\nThe afternoon sun inched toward the horizon. He didn\u2019t want to think\nabout how much worse it would get once night fell.\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if they don\u2019t want to,\u201d Tharion was yelling into his phone.\n\u201cTell them to go to shore.\u201d A pause. \u201cThen tell them to take anyone they can\ncarry under the surface!\u201d\nIsaiah was on the phone across the room. \u201cNo, that time warp was just\nsome spell that went wrong, Naomi. Yeah, it caused the Gates to open. No,\nget the 33rd to the Old Square. Get them to the Old Square Gate right now.\nI don\u2019t care if they all get ripped to shreds\u2014\u201d Isaiah pulled his phone away\nfrom his ear, blinking at the screen.\nIsaiah\u2019s eyes met Hunt\u2019s. \u201cThe CBD is under siege. The 33rd are being\nslaughtered.\u201d He didn\u2019t muse whether Naomi had just been one of them, or\nhad merely lost her phone in the fight.\nRuhn and Flynn dialed number after number. No one answered. As if\nthe Fae leaders left in the city were all dead, too.\nSabine got through. \u201cIthan\u2014report.\u201d\nDeclan wordlessly patched Sabine\u2019s number through to the room\u2019s\nspeakers. Ithan Holstrom\u2019s panting filled the space, his location pinging\nfrom outside the bespelled and impenetrable Den. Unearthly, feral growls\nthat did not belong to wolves cut between his words. \u201cThey\u2019re fucking\neverywhere. We can barely keep them away\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHold positions,\u201d Sabine commanded. \u201cHold your positions and await\nfurther orders.\u201d\nHumans and Vanir alike were running, children in their arms, to any\nopen shelter they could find. Many were already shut, sealed by the frantic\npeople inside.\nHunt asked Isaiah, \u201cHow long until the 32nd can make it down from\nHilene?\u201d\n\u201cAn hour,\u201d the angel replied, eyes on the screen. On the slaughter, on\nthe panicking city. \u201cThey\u2019ll be too late.\u201d And if Naomi was down, either\ninjured or dead \u2026 Fuck.\nFlynn thundered at someone on the phone, \u201cGet the Rose Gate\nsurrounded now. You\u2019re just handing the city to them.\u201d\nHunt surveyed the bloodshed and sorted through the city\u2019s few options.\nThey\u2019d need armies to surround all seven Gates that opened to Hel\u2014and\nfind some way to close those portals.\nHypaxia had risen from her seat. She studied the screens with grim\ndetermination and said calmly into her phone, \u201cSuit up and move out. We\u2019re\nheading in.\u201d\nEveryone turned toward her. The young queen didn\u2019t seem to notice.\nShe just ordered whoever was on the line, \u201cTo the city. Now.\u201d\nSabine hissed, \u201cYou\u2019ll all be slaughtered.\u201d And too late, Hunt didn\u2019t\nsay.\nHypaxia ended the call and pointed to a screen on the left wall, its\nfootage of the Old Square. \u201cI would rather die like her than watch innocents\ndie while I\u2019m sitting in here.\u201d\nHunt turned to where she\u2019d pointed, the hair on his neck rising. As if\nknowing what he\u2019d see.\nThere, racing through the streets in Danika\u2019s leather jacket, sword in\none hand and gun in the other, was Bryce.\nRunning not from the danger, but into it.\nShe roared something, over and over. Declan locked into the feeds,\nchanging from camera to camera to follow her down the street. \u201cI think I\ncan pull up her audio and isolate her voice against the ambient noise,\u201d he\nsaid to no one in particular. And then\u2014\n\u201cGet into the shelters!\u201d she was screaming. Her words echoed off\nevery part of the room.\nDuck, slash, shoot. She moved like she\u2019d trained with the Aux her\nentire life.\n\u201cGet inside now!\u201d she bellowed, whirling to aim at a winged demon\nblotting out the mockingly golden afternoon sun. Her gun fired, and the\ncreature screeched, careening into an alley. Declan\u2019s fingers flew on the\nkeyboard as he kept her on-screen.\n\u201cWhere the fuck is she going?\u201d Fury said.\nBryce kept running. Kept firing. She did not miss.\nHunt looked at her surroundings, and realized where she was headed.\nTo the most defenseless place in Crescent City, full of humans with no\nmagic. No preternatural gifts or strength.\n\u201cShe\u2019s going to the Meadows,\u201d Hunt said.\nIt was worse than anything Bryce had imagined.\nHer arm was numb from the bite of the gun every time she fired,\nreeking blood covered her, and there was no end to the snapping teeth; the\nleathery wings; the raging, lightless eyes. The afternoon bled toward a\nvibrant sunset, the sky soon matching the gore in the streets.\nBryce sprinted, her breath sharp as a knife in her chest.\nHer handgun ran out. She didn\u2019t waste time feeling for ammo she\ndidn\u2019t have left. No, she just hurled the gun at a winged black demon that\nswooped for her, knocking it off-kilter, and unslung the rifle from her\nshoulder. Hunt\u2019s rifle. His cedar-and-rain scent wrapped around her as she\npumped the barrel, and by the time the demon had whirled back her way,\njaws snapping, she\u2019d fired.\nIts head was blasted off in a spray of red.\nStill she ran on, working her way into the city. Past the few still-open\nshelters, whose occupants were doing their best to defend the entrances.

The conference center armory, too. The guns, the\nswords\u2014the helicopters, too. The cars. All of it, wrecked.\u201d\nDread curdled in Hunt\u2019s gut as the Autumn King murmured, \u201cMicah.\u201d\nThe Archangel must have done it before he left, quietly and unseen.\nAnticipating keeping them at bay while he experimented with the Horn\u2019s\npower. With Bryce.\n\u201cI have a helicopter,\u201d Fury said. \u201cI kept it off-site.\u201d\nRuhn got to his feet. \u201cThen we move out now.\u201d It would still take\nthirty minutes to get there.\n\u201cThe city is a slaughterhouse,\u201d Sabine was saying into the phone.\n\u201cHold your posts in Moonwood and FiRo!\u201d\nEvery pack in the Aux was linked to the call, able to hear each other.\nWith a few keystrokes, Declan had linked Sabine\u2019s phone to the system in\nthe conference room so the Aux might hear them all as well. But some\npacks had stopped responding altogether.\nHunt snapped at Sabine, \u201cGet a fucking wolf pack to the Old Square\nnow!\u201d Even with Fury\u2019s helicopter, he\u2019d be too late. But if help could at\nleast reach Bryce before she headed solo into the charnel house that would\nbe the Meadows\u2014 Sabine snapped back at him, \u201cThere are no wolves left\nfor the Old Square!\u201d\nBut the Prime of the wolves had stirred at last, and pointed an ancient,\ngnarled finger to the screen. To the feeds. And he said, \u201cOne wolf remains\nin the Old Square.\u201d\nEveryone looked then. To where he\u2019d pointed. Whom he\u2019d pointed to.\nBryce raced through the carnage, sword glinting with each swipe and\nduck and slash.\nSabine choked. \u201cThat\u2019s Danika\u2019s sword you\u2019re sensing, Father\u2014\u201d\nThe Prime\u2019s age-worn eyes blinked unseeingly at the screen. His hand\ncurled on his chest. \u201cA wolf.\u201d He tapped his heart. Still Bryce fought\nonward toward the Meadows, still she ran interference for anyone fleeing\nfor the shelters, buying them a path to safety. \u201cA true wolf.\u201d\nHunt\u2019s throat tightened to the point of pain. He extended his hand to\nIsaiah. \u201cGive me your phone.\u201d\nIsaiah didn\u2019t question him, and didn\u2019t say a word as he handed it over.\nHunt dialed a number he\u2019d memorized, since he hadn\u2019t dared to store it in\nhis contacts. The call rang and rang before it finally went through. \u201cI\u2019m\nguessing this is important?\u201d\nHunt didn\u2019t bother to identify himself as he growled, \u201cYou owe me a\ngods-damned favor.\u201d\nThe Viper Queen only said, amusement coating her rich voice, \u201cOh?\u201d\nTwo minutes later, Hunt had risen from his seat, intent on following Ruhn\nto Fury\u2019s helicopter, when Jesiba\u2019s phone rang. The sorceress announced,\nvoice strained, \u201cIt\u2019s Bryce.\u201d\nHunt whipped his head to the camera feed, and sure enough, Bryce had\ntucked her phone into her bra strap over her shoulder, presumably leaving it\non speaker. She wove around abandoned cars as she crossed the border into\nAsphodel Meadows. The sun began to set, as if Solas himself was\nabandoning them.\n\u201cBring it up on the speakers and merge the call with the Aux lines,\u201d\nJesiba ordered Declan, and answered the phone. \u201cBryce?\u201d\nBryce\u2019s panting was labored. Her rifle cracked like breaking thunder.\n\u201cTell whoever\u2019s at the Summit that I need backup in the Meadows\u2014I\u2019m\nheading for the shelter near the Mortal Gate.\u201d\nRuhn vaulted down the stairs and ran right to the speaker in the center\nof the table. He said to it, \u201cBryce, it\u2019s a massacre. Get inside that shelter\nbefore they all shut\u2014\u201d\nHer rifle boomed, and another demon went down. But more swept\nthrough the Gates and into the city, staining the streets with blood as surely\nas the vibrant sunset now stained the sky.\nBryce ducked behind a dumpster for cover as she fired again and\nagain. Reloaded.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no backup for Asphodel Meadows,\u201d Sabine said. \u201cEvery pack\nis stationed\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThere are children here!\u201d Bryce screamed. \u201cThere are babies!\u201d\nThe room fell silent. A deeper sort of horror spread through Hunt like\nink in water.\nAnd then a male voice panted over the speakers, \u201cI\u2019m coming, Bryce.\u201d\nBryce\u2019s bloodied face crumpled as she whispered, \u201cIthan?\u201d\nSabine snarled, \u201cHolstrom, stay at your fucking post\u2014\u201d\nBut Ithan said again, more urgently this time, \u201cBryce, I\u2019m coming.\nHang on.\u201d A pause. Then he added, \u201cWe\u2019re all coming.\u201d\nHunt\u2019s knees wobbled as Sabine bellowed at Ithan, \u201cYou are\ndisobeying a direct order from your\u2014\u201d\nIthan cut off her call.

The foxes. It was who they were. Who they\nhad always been. Defenders of those who could not protect themselves.\nDefenders of the small, the young.\nShifter or true animal, that truth lay etched in the soul of every canine.\nIthan Holstrom sprinted toward Asphodel Meadows with the weight of\nthat history behind him, burning in his heart. He prayed he was not too late."}, "85": {"Name": "PART IV THE RAVINE-Chapter 85", "Page Content": " 5 \nBryce knew it was stupid luck that kept her alive. And pure adrenaline that\nmade her focus her aim so clearly. Calmly.\nBut with each block she cleared as the sunset deepened, her legs\nmoved more slowly. Her reactions lagged. Her arms ached, becoming\nleaden. Every pull of the trigger took a bit more effort.\nJust a little longer\u2014that was all she needed. Just a little longer, until\nshe could make sure that everyone in Asphodel Meadows got into a shelter\nbefore they all closed. It wouldn\u2019t be long now.\nThe shelter halfway down the block remained open, figures holding\nthe line in front of it while human families rushed in. The Mortal Gate lay a\nfew blocks northward\u2014still open to Hel.\nSo Bryce planted herself at the intersection, sheathing Danika\u2019s sword\nas she again raised Hunt\u2019s rifle to her shoulder. She had six rounds left.\nIthan would be here soon. Any moment now.\nA demon surged from around a corner, taloned fingers gouging lines\ninto the cobblestones. The rifle bit into her shoulder as she fired. The\ndemon was still falling, sliding across the ground, when she angled the rifle\nand fired again. Another demon went down.\nFour bullets left.\nBehind her, humans screamed orders. Hurry! Into the shelter! Drop the\nbag and run!\nBryce fired at a demon soaring across the intersection, right for the\nshelter. The demon went down twenty feet from the entrance. The humans\nfinished it off.\nInside the shelter\u2019s open mouth, children shrieked, babies wailed.\nBryce fired again. Again. Again.\nAnother demon barreled around the corner, sprinting for her. The\ntrigger clicked.\nOut. Done. Empty.\nThe demon leapt, jaws opening wide to reveal twin rows of dagger-\nsharp teeth. Aiming for her throat. Bryce barely had time to lift the rifle and\nwedge it between those gaping jaws. Metal and wood groaned, and the\nworld tilted with the impact.\nShe and the demon slammed into the cobblestones, her bones barking\nin pain. The demon clamped down on the rifle. It snapped in two.\nBryce managed to hurl herself backward from under the demon as it\nspat out the pieces of the rifle. Maw leaking saliva on the bloodied streets, it\nadvanced on her. Seemed to savor each step.\nWith her sheathed sword pinned beneath her, Bryce reached for the\nknife at her thigh. As if it would do anything, as if it would stop this\u2014\nThe demon sank onto its haunches, readying for the kill.\nThe ground shook behind her as Bryce angled her wrist, blade tilting\nupward\u2014\nA sword plunged through the demon\u2019s gray head.\nA massive sword, at least four feet long, borne by a towering, armored\nmale figure. Blue lights glowed along the blade. More glared along sleek\nblack body armor and a matching helmet. And across the male\u2019s chest, an\nemblem of a striking cobra glowed.\nOne of the Viper Queen\u2019s Fae bodyguards.\nSix others raced past him, the cobblestones shaking beneath their feet,\nguns and swords drawn. No venom-addled stupor to be seen. Just lethal\nprecision.\nAnd with the Viper Queen\u2019s Fae guards, wolves and foxes and canines\nof every breed flowed by, launching into the fray.\nBryce scrambled to her feet, nodding to the warrior who\u2019d saved her.\nThe Fae male only whirled, his metal-encased hands grabbing a demon by\nthe shoulders and wrenching it apart with a mighty yell. He tore the demon\nin two.\nBut more of Hel\u2019s worst thundered and soared for them. So Bryce\nfreed Danika\u2019s sword again from across her back.\nShe willed strength to her arm, bracing her feet as another demon\ngalloped down the street for her. Canine shifters engaged demons all\naround, forming a barrier of fur and teeth and claws between the oncoming\nhorde and the shelter behind them.\nBryce feinted left, swiping her sword up as the demon fell for her fake-\nout. But the blade didn\u2019t break through bone and to the soft, vulnerable\norgans beneath. The creature roared, pivoting, and lunged again. She gritted\nher teeth, and lifted her sword in challenge, the demon too frenzied to\nnotice that she\u2019d let herself become the distraction.\nWhile the massive gray wolf attacked from behind.\nIthan ripped into the demon in an explosion of teeth and claws, so fast\nand brutal it momentarily stunned her. She\u2019d forgotten how enormous he\nwas in this form\u2014all the shifters were at least three times the size of normal\nanimals, but Ithan had always been larger. Exactly like his brother.\nIthan spat out the demon\u2019s throat and shifted, wolf becoming a tall\nmale in a flash of light. Blood coated his navy T-shirt and jeans as much as\nit did her own clothes, but before they could speak, his brown eyes flared\nwith alarm. Bryce twisted, met by the rancid breath of a demon as it dive-\nbombed her.\nShe ducked and thrust the sword upward, the demon\u2019s shriek nearly\nbursting her ears as she let the beast drag its belly down the blade. Gutting\nit.\nGore splattered her sneakers, her torn leggings, but she made sure the\ndemon\u2019s head was rolling before whirling to Ithan. Just as he drew a sword\nfrom a sheath on his back and split another demon apart.\nTheir stares held, and all the words she\u2019d needed to say hung there.\nShe saw them in his eyes, too, as he realized whose jacket and sword she\nbore.\nBut she offered a grim smile. Later. If they somehow survived this, if\nthey could last another few minutes and get into the shelter \u2026 They\u2019d speak\nthen.\nIthan nodded, understanding.\nBryce knew it wasn\u2019t adrenaline alone that powered her as she\nlaunched back into the carnage.\n\u201cShelters close in four minutes,\u201d Declan announced to the conference room.\n\u201cWhy hasn\u2019t your helicopter arrived?\u201d Ruhn asked Fury. He stood,\nFlynn rising with him.\nAxtar checked her phone. \u201cIt\u2019s on its way over from\u2014\u201d\nThe doors at the top of the pit burst open, and Sandriel entered on a\nstorm wind. And there was no sign of her triarii or Pollux as she strode\ndown the stairs. No one spoke.\nHunt prepared himself as she glanced his way, seated between a now-\nstanding Ruhn and Hypaxia. The gorsian manacles lay on the table before\nhim.\nBut she merely returned to her seat at the lowermost table. She had\nbigger concerns at hand, he supposed. Her attention darting between the\nscreens and feeds and updates, Sandriel said, \u201cThere is nothing we can do\nfor the city with the Gates open to Hel. We are under orders to remain\nhere.\u201d\nRuhn started. \u201cWe are needed\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWe are to remain here.\u201d The words rumbled like thunder through the\nroom. \u201cThe Asteri are sending help.\u201d\nHunt sagged in his seat, and Ruhn sank down beside him. \u201cThank\nfuck,\u201d the prince muttered, rubbing shaking hands over his face.\nThey must have dispatched the Asterian Guard, then. And further\nreinforcements. Perhaps Sandriel\u2019s triarii had gone to Lunathion. They\nmight all be psychotic assholes, but at least they could hold their own in a\nfight. Fuck, the Hammer alone would be a blessing to the city right now.\n\u201cThree minutes until shelter lockdown,\u201d Declan said.\nIn the general chaos of the audio feed Declan had pulled up, a shifter\u2019s\nhowl went out, warning everyone to get to safety. To abandon the boundary\nthey\u2019d established against the horde and run like Hel for the still-open metal\ndoor.\nHumans were still fleeing, though. Adults carrying children and pets\nsprinted for the opening, hardly bigger than a single-car garage door. The\nViper Queen\u2019s warriors and a few of the wolves remained at the\nintersection.\n\u201cTwo minutes,\u201d Declan said.\nBryce and Ithan fought side by side. Where one stumbled, the other did\nnot fail. Where one baited a demon, the other executed it.\nA siren blared in the city. A warning. Still Bryce and Ithan held the\ncorner.\n\u201cThirty seconds,\u201d Declan said.\n\u201cGo,\u201d Hunt urged. \u201cGo, Bryce.\u201d\nShe gutted a demon, whirling toward the shelter at last, Ithan moving\nwith her. Good, she\u2019d get inside, and could wait it out until the Asterian\nGuard arrived to wipe these fuckers away. Maybe they\u2019d know how to seal\nthe voids in the Gates.\nThe shelter door began closing.\n\u201cThey\u2019re too far,\u201d Fury said quietly.\n\u201cThey\u2019ll make it,\u201d Hunt ground out, even as he eyed the distance\nbetween the slowly closing door and the two figures racing for it, Bryce\u2019s\nred hair a banner behind her.\nIthan stumbled, and Bryce grabbed his hand before he could go down.\nA nasty gash gleamed in Ithan\u2019s side, blood soaking his T-shirt. How the\nmale was even running\u2014\nThe door was halfway closed. Losing inches every second.\nA clawed, humanoid hand from inside wrapped around its edge.\nMultiple pairs.\nAnd then a young, brown-haired wolf was there, her teeth gritted, her\nface lupine, roaring as she heaved against the inevitable. As every one of\nthe wolves behind her grabbed the sliding door and tried to slow it.\n\u201cFifteen seconds,\u201d Declan whispered.\nBryce ran and ran and ran.\nOne by one, the wolves of Ithan\u2019s pack lost their grip on the door.\nUntil only that one young female was holding it back, a foot braced against\nthe concrete wall, bellowing in defiance\u2014\nIthan and Bryce charged for the shelter, the wolf\u2019s focus solely on the\nshelter door.\nOnly three feet of space remained. Not enough room for both of them.\nBryce\u2019s stare shot to Ithan\u2019s face. Sorrow filled her eyes. And\ndetermination.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Hunt breathed. Knowing exactly what she\u2019d do.\nBryce dropped behind just a step. Just enough to draw upon her Fae\nstrength to shove Ithan forward. To save Connor Holstrom\u2019s brother.\nIthan twisted toward Bryce, eyes flaring with rage and despair and\ngrief, hand outstretched, but too late.\nThe metal door shut with a boom that seemed to echo across the city.\nThat was echoed across the city, as every shelter door shut at last.\nHer momentum was too great to slow. Bryce slammed into the metal\ndoor, grunting in pain.\nShe turned in place, face leached of color. Searching for options and\ncoming up empty.\nHunt read it on her face, then. For the first time, Bryce had no idea\nwhat to do.\nEvery part of Bryce shook as she took cover in the slight alcove before the\nshelter, the sunset a vibrant wash of orange and ruby\u2014like the final battle\ncry of the world before the oncoming night.\nThe demons had moved on, but more would be coming. Soon. As long\nas the Gates held those portals to Hel, they would never stop coming.\nSomeone\u2014Ithan, probably\u2014began pounding on the shelter door\nbehind her. As if he\u2019d claw his way through, open up a passage for her to\nget inside. She ignored the sound.\nThe Viper Queen\u2019s warriors were flashes of metal and light far down\nthe street, still fighting. Some had fallen, heaps of steaming armor and\nblood.\nIf she could make it to her apartment, it had enchantments enough to\nprotect her and any others she could get inside. But it was twenty blocks\naway. It might as well have been twenty miles.\nAn idea flared, and she weighed it, considering. She could try. She had\nto try.\nBryce took a bracing breath. In her hand, Danika\u2019s sword shook like a\nreed in the wind.\nShe could make it. Somehow, she\u2019d find a way.\nShe leapt into the blood-slick streets, sword held ready to attack. She\ndidn\u2019t look back at the shelter behind her as she began to run, blind memory\nof the city grid sinking in to guide her on the fastest route. A snarl rumbled\nfrom around a corner, and Bryce barely brought up her sword in time to\nintercept the demon. She partially severed its neck, and was running again\nbefore it fully hit the ground. She had to keep moving. Had to get to the Old\nSquare\u2014\nDead shifters and the Viper Queen\u2019s soldiers lay in the streets. Even\nmore dead humans around them. Most in pieces.\nAnother demon barreled from the red sky\u2014\nShe screamed as it knocked her back, slamming her into a car so hard\nthe windows shattered. She had all of a second to wrench open the\npassenger-side door and climb in before it landed again. Attacked the car.\nBryce scrambled over the armrests and stick shift, fumbling for the\ndriver\u2019s-side door. She yanked on the handle and half fell into the street, the\ndemon so distracted with shredding the tires on the opposite side that it\ndidn\u2019t see her lurch into a sprint.\nThe Old Square. If she could make it to the Old Square\u2014\nTwo demons raced for her. The only thing she could do was run as the\nlight began to fade.\nAlone. She was alone out here."}, "86": {"Name": "PART IV THE RAVINE-Chapter 86", "Page Content": " 6 \nThe city was starting to go quiet. Every time Declan checked the audio in\nanother district, more screams had diminished, cut off one by one.\nNot from any calm or salvation, Hunt knew.\nThe voids in the Gates remained open. The sunset gave way to bruised\npurple skies. When true night fell, he could imagine what sort of horrors\nHel would send through. The kind that did not like the light, that had been\nbred and learned to hunt in the dark.\nBryce was still out there. One mistake, one misstep, and she would be\ndead.\nThere would be no healing, no regeneration. Not without the Drop.\nShe made it over the border of the Old Square. But she didn\u2019t run for\nsafety. No, she seemed to be running for the Heart Gate, where the flow of\ndemons had halted. As if Hel were indeed waiting for true night to begin\nbefore its second round.\nHis heart thundered as she paused down the block from the Gate. As\nshe ducked into the alcove of a nearby shelter.

Her final chance to\nsay goodbye to her parents, her loved ones.\nA faint ringing sounded in the conference room. From the table at its\ncenter. Hunt looked to Jesiba, but her phone remained dark. Ruhn\u2019s stayed\ndark as well. Everyone went silent as Sandriel pulled a phone from her\npocket. Hunt\u2019s phone.\nSandriel glanced toward him, shock slackening her face.

Felt nothing. It had all crumbled inside him\nthe moment she\u2019d hung up.\nBryce leapt the fence around the Gate and halted before its towering\narchway. Before the terrible black void within it.\nA faint white radiance began to glow around her.\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d Fury whispered.\nIt flickered, growing brighter in the night.\nEnough to illuminate her slender hands cupping a sparkling, pulsing\nlight before her chest.\nThe light was coming from her chest\u2014had been pulled from inside it.\nLike it had dwelled inside her all along. Bryce\u2019s eyes were closed, her face\nserene.\nHer hair drifted above her head. Bits of debris floated up around her,\ntoo. As if gravity had ceased to exist.\nThe light she held was so stark it cast the rest of the world into grays\nand blacks. Slowly, her eyes opened, amber blazing like the first pure rays\nof dawn. A soft, secret smile graced her mouth.\nHer eyes lifted to the Gate looming above her. The light between her\nhands grew stronger.\nRuhn fell to his knees.\n\u201cI am Bryce Quinlan,\u201d she said to the Gate, to the void, to all of Hel\nbehind it. Her voice was serene\u2014wise and laughing. \u201cHeir to the Starborn\nFae.\u201d\nThe ground slid out from under Hunt as the light between her hands,\nthe star she\u2019d drawn from her shattered heart, flared as bright as the sun.\nDanika knelt on the asphalt, hands interlocked behind her blood-soaked\nhair. The two gunshot wounds to her leg had stopped leaking blood, but\nBryce knew the bullets remained lodged in her upper thigh. The pain from\nkneeling had to be unbearable.\n\u201cYou stupid cunt,\u201d the asp shifter spat at her, opening the chamber of\nhis handgun with brutal precision. Bullets were on the way\u2014as soon as his\nassociate found them, that gun would be loaded.\nThe agony in Bryce\u2019s injured arm was secondary. All of it was\nsecondary to that gun.\nThe motorcycle smoldered thirty feet away, the rifle thrown even\nfarther into the arid scrub. Down the road, the semitruck idled, its cargo\nhold filled with all those petrified animals on their way to gods knew where.\nThey had failed. Their wild rescue attempt had failed.\nDanika\u2019s caramel eyes met the asp shifter\u2019s. The leader of this horrific\nsmuggling ring. The male responsible for this moment, when the shootout\nthat had taken place at a hundred miles an hour had turned on them.\nDanika had been steering the motorcycle, an arm looped through Bryce\u2019s\nleg to hold her steady as she\u2019d aimed her rifle. Taken out the asps\u2019 two\nsedans full of equally hateful males intent on hurting and selling those\nanimals. They\u2019d been nearing the racing semi when the male before them\nhad managed a shot to the motorcycle\u2019s tires.\nThe motorcycle had flipped, and Danika had reacted with a wolf\u2019s\nspeed. She had wrapped her body around Bryce. And taken the brunt of the\nimpact.\nHer shredded skin, the fractured pelvis\u2014all thanks to that.\n\u201cBryce,\u201d Danika whispered, tears running down her face now as the\nreality of this colossal fuckup set in. \u201cBryce, I love you. And I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nBryce shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t regret it.\u201d The truth.\nAnd then the asp shifter\u2019s associate arrived, bullets in hand. Their\nclink as they loaded into the gun echoed through Bryce\u2019s bones.\nDanika sobbed. \u201cI love you, Bryce.\u201d\nThe words rippled between them. Cleaved Bryce\u2019s heart wide open.\n\u201cI love you,\u201d Danika said again.\nDanika had never said those words to her. Not once in four years of\ncollege. Not once to anyone, Bryce knew. Not even Sabine.\nEspecially not Sabine.\nBryce watched the tears roll down Danika\u2019s proud, fierce face. A lock\nclicked open in Bryce\u2019s heart. Her soul.\n\u201cClose your eyes, Danika,\u201d she said softly. Danika just stared at her.\nOnly for this. Only for Danika would she do this, risk this.\nThe gravel around Bryce began to shiver. Began to float upward.\nDanika\u2019s eyes widened. Bryce\u2019s hair drifted as if underwater. In deep space.\nThe asp shifter finished loading the bullets and pointed the gun at\nDanika\u2019s face. His colleague smirked from a step behind him.\nBryce held Danika\u2019s stare. Did not look away as she said again,\n\u201cDanika, close your eyes.\u201d Trembling, Danika obeyed. Squeezed them shut.\nThe asp shifter clicked off the gun\u2019s safety, not even glancing at Bryce\nand the debris that floated toward the sky. \u201cYeah, you\u2019d better close your\neyes, you\u2014\u201d\nBryce exploded. White, blinding light ruptured from her, unleashed\nfrom that secret place in her heart.\nRight into the eyes of the asp shifter. He screamed, clawing at his face.\nBlazing bright as the sun, Bryce moved.\nPain forgotten, she had his arm in her hands in a heartbeat. Twisted it\nso he dropped the gun into her waiting palm. Another movement and he was\nsprawled on the asphalt.\nWhere she fired that bullet meant for Danika into his heart.\nHis accomplice was screaming, on his knees and clawing at his eyes.\nBryce fired again.\nHe stopped screaming.\nBut Bryce did not stop burning. Not as she raced for the semi\u2019s cab\u2014\nfor the final asp now trying to start its engine. Danika trembled on the\nground, hands over her head, eyes squeezed shut against the brightness.\nThe asp shifter gave up on the engine and fled the cab, sprinting down\nthe road. Bryce took aim, just as Randall had taught her, and waited for the\nshot to come to her.\nAnother crack of the gun. The male dropped.\nBryce blazed for a long moment, the world bleached into blinding\nwhite.\nSlowly, carefully, she spooled the light back into herself. Smothered it,\nthe secret she and her parents had kept for so long. From her sire, from the\nAsteri, from Midgard.\nFrom Ruhn.\nThe pure light of a star\u2014from another world. From long, long ago.\nThe gift of the ancient Fae, reborn again. Light, but nothing more than that.\nNot an Asteri, who possessed brute power of the stars. Just light.\nIt meant nothing to her. But the Starborn gifts, the title\u2014they had\nalways meant something to Ruhn. And that first time she\u2019d met him, she\u2019d\nintended to share her secret with him. He\u2019d been kind, joyful at finding a\nnew sister. She\u2019d instantly known she could trust him with this secret,\nhidden thing.\nBut then she\u2019d seen their father\u2019s cruelty. Seen how that Starborn gift\ngave her brother just the slightest edge against that fucking monster. Seen\nthe pride her brother denied but undoubtedly felt at being Starborn, blessed\nand chosen by Urd.\nShe couldn\u2019t bring herself to tell Ruhn the truth. Even after things fell\napart, she hid it. Would never tell anyone\u2014anyone at all. Except Danika.\nBlue skies and olive trees filtered back in, color returning to the world\nas Bryce hid the last of her starlight inside her chest. Danika still trembled\non the asphalt.\n\u201cDanika,\u201d Bryce said.\nDanika lowered her hands from her face. Opened her eyes. Bryce\nwaited for the terror her mother had warned about, should someone learn\nwhat she bore. The strange, terrible light that had come from another\nworld.\nBut there was only wonder on Danika\u2019s face.\nWonder\u2014and love.\nBryce stood before the Gate, holding the star she\u2019d kept hidden within her\nheart, and let the light build. Let it flow out of her chest, untethered and\npure.\nEven with the void mere feet away, Hel just a step beyond it, a strange\nsense of calm wended through her. She\u2019d kept this light a secret for so long,\nhad lived in such utter terror of anyone finding out, that despite everything,\nrelief filled her.\nThere had been so many times these weeks when she was sure Ruhn\nwould realize it at last. Her blatant disinterest in learning about anything\nrelated to the first Starborn, Prince Pelias and Queen Theia, had bordered on\nsuspicious, she\u2019d feared. And when he\u2019d laid the Starsword on the table in\nthe gallery library and it had hummed, shimmering, she\u2019d had to physically\npull back to avoid the instinct to touch it, to answer its silent, lovely song.\nHer sword\u2014it was her sword, and Ruhn\u2019s. And with that light in her\nveins, with the star that slumbered inside her heart, the Starsword had\nrecognized her not as a royal, worthy Fae, but as kin. Kin to those who had\nforged it so long ago.\nLike called to like. Even the kristallos\u2019s venom in her leg had not been\nable to stifle the essence of what she was. It had blocked her access to the\nlight, but not what lay stamped in her blood. The moment the venom had\ncome out of her leg, as Hunt\u2019s lips had met hers that first time, she\u2019d felt it\nawaken again. Freed.\nAnd now here she was, the starlight building within her hands.\nIt was a useless gift, she\u2019d decided as a child. It couldn\u2019t do much at all\nbeyond blinding people, as she\u2019d done to her father\u2019s men when they came\nafter her and her mother and Randall, as had happened to the Oracle when\nthe seer peered into her future and beheld only her blazing light, as she\u2019d\ndone to those asp-hole smugglers.\nOnly her father\u2019s unfaltering Fae arrogance and snobbery had kept him\nfrom realizing it after her Oracle visit. The male was incapable of imagining\nanyone but pure Fae being blessed by fate.\nBlessed\u2014as if this gift made her something special. It didn\u2019t. It was an\nold power and nothing more. She had no interest in the throne or crown or\npalace that could come with it. None.\nBut Ruhn \u2026 He might have claimed otherwise, but the first time he\u2019d\ntold her about his Ordeal, when he\u2019d won the sword from its ancient resting\nplace in Avallen, she\u2019d seen how his face had glowed with pride that he\u2019d\nbeen able to draw the sword from its sheath.\nSo she\u2019d let him have it, the title and the sword. Had tried to open\nRuhn\u2019s eyes to their father\u2019s true nature as often as she could, even if it\nmade her father resent her further.\nShe would have kept this burning, shining secret inside her until her\ndying day. But she\u2019d realized what she had to do for her city. This world.\nThe dregs of the light flowed out of her chest, all of it now cupped\nbetween her palms.\nShe\u2019d never done it before\u2014wholly removed the star itself. She\u2019d only\nglowed and blinded, never summoned its burning core from inside her. Her\nknees wobbled, and she gritted her teeth against the strain of holding the\nlight in place.\nAt least she\u2019d spoken to Hunt one last time. She hadn\u2019t expected him\nto be able to pick up. Had thought the phone would go right to audiomail\nwhere she could say everything she wanted. The words she still hadn\u2019t said\naloud to him.\nShe didn\u2019t let herself think of it as she took the final step to the Gate\u2019s\nquartz archway.\nShe was Starborn, and the Horn lay within her, repaired and now filled\nwith her light.\nThis had to work.\nThe quartz of the Gate was a conduit. A prism. Able to take light and\npower and refract them. She closed her eyes, remembering the rainbows\nthis Gate had been adorned with on the last day of Danika\u2019s life, when\nthey\u2019d come here together. Made their wishes.\nThis had to work. A final wish.\n\u201cClose,\u201d Bryce whispered, shaking.\nAnd she thrust her starlight into the Gate\u2019s clear stone."}, "88": {"Name": "PART IV THE RAVINE-Chapter 88", "Page Content": " 8 \nHunt had no words in his head, his heart, as Bryce shoved her burning\nstarlight into the Gate.\nWhite light blasted from the Gate\u2019s clear stone.\nIt filled the square, shooting outward for blocks. Demons caught in its\npath screamed as they were blinded, then fled. Like they remembered\nwhom it had once belonged to. How the Starborn Prince had battled their\nhordes with it.\nThe Starborn line had bred true\u2014twice.\nRuhn\u2019s face drained of color as he remained kneeling and beheld his\nsister, the blazing Gate. What she\u2019d declared to the world. What she\u2019d\nrevealed herself to be.\nHis rival. A threat to all he stood to inherit.\nHunt knew what the Fae did to settle disputes to the throne.\nBryce possessed the light of a star, such as hadn\u2019t been witnessed since\nthe First Wars. Jesiba looked like she\u2019d seen a ghost. Fury gaped at the\nscreen. When the flare dimmed, Hunt\u2019s breath caught in his throat.\nThe void within the Heart Gate was gone. She\u2019d channeled her light\nthrough the Horn somehow\u2014and sealed the portal.\nIn the stunned silence of the conference room, they watched Bryce\npant, leaning against one side of the Gate before sliding to the slate tiles.\nThe crystal archway still shone. A temporary haven that would make any\ndemons think twice before approaching, fearful of a Starborn descendant.\nBut the rest of the Gates in the city remained open.\nA phone rang\u2014an outgoing call, linked to the room\u2019s speakers. Hunt\nscanned the room for the culprit and found the Autumn King with his phone\nin his hands. But the male was apparently too lost in the rage crinkling his\nface to care that the call was audible to everyone. Declan Emmet showed no\nsign of even trying to make the call private as Ember Quinlan picked up the\nphone and said, \u201cWho is\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve known she was Starborn Fae all these years and lied to me\nabout it,\u201d the king bit out.\nEmber didn\u2019t miss a beat. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for this call for more than\ntwenty years.\u201d\n\u201cYou bitch\u2014\u201d\nA low, agonized laugh. \u201cWho do you think ended your goons all those\nyears ago? Not me and Randall. They had her in their grasp\u2014by the neck.\nAnd they had us at gunpoint.\u201d Another laugh. \u201cShe realized what they were\ngoing to do to me. To Randall. And she fucking blinded them.\u201d\nWhat blinds an Oracle?\nLight. Light the way the Starborn had possessed it.\nBryce still sat against the archway, breathing hard. Like summoning\nthat star, wielding the Horn, had taken everything out of her.\nRuhn murmured, more to himself than anyone, \u201cThose books claimed\nthere were multiple Starborn in the First Wars. I told her, and she \u2026\u201d He\nblinked slowly. \u201cShe already knew.\u201d\n\u201cShe lied because she loves you,\u201d Hunt ground out. \u201cSo you could\nkeep your title.\u201d\nBecause compared to the Starborn powers he\u2019d seen from Ruhn \u2026\nBryce\u2019s were the real deal. Ruhn\u2019s ashen face contorted with pain.\n\u201cWho knew?\u201d the Autumn King demanded of Ember. \u201cThose fucking\npriestesses?\u201d\n\u201cNo. Only me and Randall,\u201d Ember said. \u201cAnd Danika. She and Bryce\ngot into some serious trouble in college and it came out then. She blinded\nthe males that time, too.\u201d\nHunt remembered the photo on the guest room dresser\u2014taken in the\naftermath of that. Their closeness and exhaustion the result not just of a\nbattle fought and won but of a deadly secret revealed at last.\n\u201cHer tests showed no power,\u201d the Autumn King spat.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Ember said quietly. \u201cThey were correct.\u201d\n\u201cExplain.\u201d\n\u201cIt is a gift of starlight. Light, and nothing more. It never meant\nanything to us, but to your people \u2026\u201d Ember paused. \u201cWhen Bryce was\nthirteen, she agreed to visit you. To meet you\u2014to see if you could be\ntrusted to know what she possessed and not be threatened by it.\u201d\nTo see if he could handle that such a gift had gone to a half-human\nbastard and not Ruhn.\nHunt saw no fear on the prince\u2019s face, though. No envy or doubt. Only\nsorrow.\n\u201cBut then she met your son. And she told me that when she saw his\npride in his Chosen One status, she realized she couldn\u2019t take it away from\nhim. Not when she also saw that was the only value you placed in him.\nEven if it meant she would be denied everything she was due, even if\nrevealing herself would have meant she could lord it over you, she wouldn\u2019t\ndo that to Ruhn. Because she loved him that much more than she hated\nyou.\u201d\nRuhn\u2019s face crumpled.\nEmber spat at the Autumn King, \u201cAnd then you left her on the curb like\ngarbage.\u201d She let out another broken laugh. \u201cI hope she finally returns the\nfavor, you fucking asshole.\u201d She hung up.\nThe Autumn King hurled a pitcher of water before him across the\nroom, so hard it shattered against the wall.\nHunt\u2019s blood thrummed through him as a conversation from weeks ago\nflitted back to him: how he\u2019d spoken of having gifts he didn\u2019t really want.\nBryce had agreed, to his surprise, and then seemed to catch herself before\njoking about attracting assholes. Deflecting, hiding the truth.\nA soft female hand landed atop Hunt\u2019s. Queen Hypaxia. Her dark\nbrown eyes glowed when he looked over in surprise. Her power was a song\nof warmth through him. It was a hammer to every wall and obstacle placed\non him. And he felt that power focus on the halo\u2019s spell upon his brow.\nShe\u2019d asked him weeks ago what he\u2019d do if she removed it. Whom\nhe\u2019d kill.\nHis first target was in this room with them. His eyes darted toward\nSandriel, and Hypaxia\u2019s chin dipped, as if in confirmation.\nStill Bryce sat against the Gate. As if trying to rally herself. As if\nwondering how she could possibly do this six more times.\nDemons in adjacent streets beheld the starlight still glowing from the\nOld Square Gate and stayed back. Yes, they remembered the Starborn. Or\nknew the myths.\nAidas had known. Had watched her all these years, waiting for her to\nreveal herself.\nHypaxia\u2019s power flowed silently and unnoticed into Hunt.\nSandriel slid her phone into her pocket. As if she\u2019d been using it under\nthe table.\nRuhn saw it, too. The Crown Prince of the Fae asked with savage\nquiet, \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d\nSandriel smiled. \u201cI took care of a problem.\u201d\nHunt\u2019s power growled within him. She\u2019d have told the Asteri all she\u2019d\nseen. Not only what glowed in Bryce\u2019s veins\u2014but about the Horn, too.\nThey were likely already moving on the information. Quickly. Before\nanyone else could ponder Bryce\u2019s gifts. What it might mean to the people of\nthe world if they knew a half-human female, heir to the Starborn line, now\nbore the Horn in her very body. Able to be used only by her\u2014\nThe truth clicked into place.\nIt was why Danika had inked it on Bryce. Only the Starborn line could\nuse the Horn.\nMicah had believed the synth and Bryce\u2019s bloodline would be enough\nto let him use the Horn, overriding the need for the true Starborn power.\nThe Horn had indeed been healed\u2014but it only worked because Bryce was\nheir to the Starborn line. Object and wielder had become one.\nIf Bryce willed it, the Horn could open a portal to any world, any\nrealm. Just as Micah had wanted to do. But that kind of power\u2014belonging\nto a half-human, no less\u2014could endanger the sovereignty of the Asteri. And\nthe Asteri would take out any threat to their authority.\nA roar began building in Hunt\u2019s bones.\nRuhn snarled, \u201cThey can\u2019t kill her. She\u2019s the only one who can shut\nthose fucking Gates.\u201d\nSandriel leaned back in her chair. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t made the Drop yet,\nPrince. So they most certainly can.\u201d She added, \u201cAnd it looks like she\u2019s\nwholly drained anyway. I doubt she\u2019ll be able to close a second Gate, let\nalone six more.\u201d\nHunt\u2019s fingers curled.\nHypaxia met his stare again and smiled slightly. An invitation and\nchallenge. Her magic shimmered through him, over his forehead.\nSandriel had informed the Asteri\u2014so they\u2019d kill Bryce.\nHis Bryce. Hunt\u2019s attention narrowed on the back of Sandriel\u2019s neck.\nAnd he rose to his feet as Hypaxia\u2019s magic dissolved the halo from his\nbrow."}, "89": {"Name": "PART IV THE RAVINE-Chapter 89", "Page Content": " 9 \nThe conference room shook.\nRuhn had kept Sandriel distracted, kept her talking while Queen\nHypaxia had freed Hunt from the halo\u2019s grip. He\u2019d sensed the ripple of her\npower down the table, then seen Athalar\u2019s halo begin to glow, and had\nunderstood what the witch, her hand on Hunt\u2019s, was doing.\nThere was nothing but cold death in Hunt\u2019s eyes as the halo tattoo\nflaked away from his brow. The true face of the Umbra Mortis.\nSandriel whirled, realizing too late who now stood at her back. No\nmark across his brow. Something like pure terror crossed the Archangel\u2019s\nface as Hunt bared his teeth.\nLightning gathered around his hands. The walls cracked. Debris rained\nfrom the ceiling.\nSandriel was too slow.\nRuhn knew Sandriel had signed her own death warrant when she\ndidn\u2019t bring her triarii back with her. And stamped the official seal on it the\nmoment she\u2019d revealed that she\u2019d put Bryce in the Asteri\u2019s line of fire.\nEven her Archangel\u2019s might couldn\u2019t protect her from Athalar. From\nwhat he felt for Bryce.\nAthalar\u2019s lightning skittered over the floors. Sandriel barely had time\nto lift her arms and summon a gale-force wind before Hunt was upon her.\nLightning erupted, the entire room cracking with it.\nRuhn threw himself under a table, grabbing Hypaxia with him. Slabs\nof stone slammed onto the surface above them. Flynn swore up a storm\nbeside him, and Declan crouched low, curled around a laptop. A cloud of\ndebris filled the space, choking them. Ether coated Ruhn\u2019s tongue.\nLightning flared, licking and crackling through the room.\nThen time shifted and slowed, sliding by, by, by\u2014\n\u201cFuck,\u201d Flynn was saying between pants, each word an eternity and a\nflash, the world tipping over again, slowing and dragging. \u201cFuck.\u201d\nThen the lightning stopped. The cloud of debris pulsed and hummed.\nTime began its normal pace, and Ruhn crawled out from under the\ntable. He knew what he\u2019d find within the whirling, electrified cloud\neveryone gaped at. Fury Axtar had a gun pointed at where the Archangel\nand Hunt had stood, debris whitening her dark hair.\nHypaxia helped Ruhn to his feet. Her eyes were wide as they scanned\nthe cloud. The witch-queen had undoubtedly known that Sandriel would kill\nher for freeing Hunt. She\u2019d taken a gamble that the Umbra Mortis would be\nthe one to walk away.\nThe cloud of debris cleared, lightning fading into the dust-choked air.\nHer gamble had paid off. Blood splattered Hunt\u2019s face as his feathers\nfluttered on a phantom wind.\nAnd from his hand, gripped by the hair, dangled Sandriel\u2019s severed\nhead.\nHer mouth was still open in a scream, smoke rippling from her lips, the\nskin of her neck so damaged Ruhn knew Hunt had torn it off with his bare\nhands.\nHunt slowly lifted the head before him, as if he were one of the ancient\nheroes of the Rhagan Sea surveying a slain creature. A monster.\nHe let the Archangel\u2019s head drop. It thumped and lolled to the side,\nsmoke still trickling from the mouth, the nostrils. He\u2019d flayed her with his\nlightning from the inside out.\nThe angels in the room all knelt on one knee. Bowed. Even a wide-\neyed Isaiah Tiberian. No one on the planet had that sort of power. No one\nhad seen it fully unleashed in centuries.\nTwo Governors dead in one day. Slain by his sister and his sister\u2019s \u2026\nwhatever Hunt was. From the awe and fear on his father\u2019s face, Ruhn knew\nthe Autumn King was wondering about it. Wondering if Hunt would kill\nhim next, for how he\u2019d treated Bryce.\nBryce, his Starborn sister.\nRuhn didn\u2019t know what to think about it. That she\u2019d thought he valued\nthe Chosen One bullshit more than her. And when that fight had happened,\nhad she let things rupture between them to keep him from ever learning\nwhat she was? She\u2019d walked away from the privilege and honor and glory\n\u2014for him.\nAnd all those warnings she\u2019d given him about the Autumn King, about\ntheir father killing the last Starborn \u2026 She\u2019d lived with that fear, too.\nHunt threw the Autumn King a feral grin.\nRuhn felt a sick amount of satisfaction as his father went pale.\nBut then Hunt looked to Fury, who was pulling debris from her dark\nhair, and growled, \u201cFuck the Asteri. Get your gods-damned helicopter over\nhere.\u201d\nEvery decision, every order flowed from a long-quiet place within Hunt.\nHe sizzled with power, the lightning in his veins roaring to crack free\ninto the world, to burn and sunder. He suppressed it, promised it he\u2019d allow\nit to flow unchecked as soon as they reached the city\u2014but they had to reach\nthe city first.\nFury shook slightly\u2014as if even she had forgotten what he could do.\nWhat he\u2019d done to Sandriel with primal satisfaction, sinking into a place of\nsuch rage that there had only been his lightning and his enemy and the\nthreat she posed to Bryce. But Fury said, \u201cThe helicopter is landing on the\nroof now.\u201d\nHunt nodded and ordered the remaining angels without looking at\nthem, \u201cWe move out.\u201d\nNot one of them objected to his command. He hadn\u2019t given a shit that\nthey\u2019d bowed\u2014whatever the fuck that meant. He\u2019d only cared that they\nflew to Lunathion as fast as they could.\nFury was already at the exit, phone at her ear. Hunt strode after her,\nthrough the room full of rustling wings and stomping feet, but looked back\nover his shoulder. \u201cDanaan, Ketos\u2014you in?\u201d He needed them.\nRuhn shot to his feet without question; Tharion waited until he got the\nnod from the River Queen\u2019s daughter before rising. Amelie Ravenscroft\nstepped forward, ignoring Sabine\u2019s glare, and said, \u201cI\u2019m going with you,\ntoo.\u201d Hunt nodded again.\nFlynn was already moving, not needing to voice that he\u2019d join his\nprince\u2014to save his princess. Declan pointed to the screens. \u201cI\u2019ll be your\neyes in the field.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d Hunt said, aiming for the door.\nThe Autumn King and the Prime of the wolves, the only City Heads\npresent, remained in the pit, along with Sabine. Jesiba and Hypaxia would\nhave to keep them honest. Neither of the females so much as acknowledged\nthe other, but no animosity sparked between them, either. Hunt didn\u2019t care.\nHe silently scaled the stairs toward the roof, his companions behind\nhim. They were thirty minutes by helicopter from the city. So much could\ngo wrong before they reached it. And when they got there \u2026 it would be\npure slaughter.\nThe helicopter\u2019s blades whipped Fury\u2019s black hair as she crossed the\nlanding pad. Flynn trailed close behind, sizing up their ride, and let out an\nimpressed whistle.\nIt wasn\u2019t a luxury transport. It was a military-grade helicopter.\nComplete with two gunners on either door and a cache of assorted guns and\nweapons in duffels strapped to the floor.\nFury Axtar had not come to this meeting expecting it to be friendly.\nShe grabbed the headset from the departing pilot before slinging her slender\nbody into the cockpit.\n\u201cI\u2019m with you,\u201d Hunt said, gesturing to the helicopter as the angels\ntook off around them. \u201cMy wings can\u2019t handle the flight yet.\u201d\nRuhn leapt into the helicopter behind Flynn and Amelie, Tharion\nclaiming the left gunner. Hunt remained on the roof, shouting orders to the\ndeparting angels. Establish a perimeter around the city. Scout team:\ninvestigate the portal. Send survivors to triage at least five miles beyond\ncity walls. He didn\u2019t let himself think about how easy it was to slip back\ninto a commander\u2019s role.\nThen Hunt was in the helicopter, taking up the right gunner. Fury\nflicked switch after switch on the control panel. Hunt asked her, his voice\nhoarse, \u201cDid you know about what happened on the roof with Bryce and\nJuniper?\u201d\nIt had fucking gutted him to hear Bryce allude to it\u2014that she\u2019d\nconsidered jumping. To hear that he\u2019d come so close to losing her before he\neven knew her. Ruhn turned toward them, his agonized face confirming that\nhe felt the same.\nFury didn\u2019t stop her prep. \u201cBryce was a ghost for a long while, Hunt.\nShe pretended she wasn\u2019t, but she was.\u201d The helicopter finally pulled into\nthe air. \u201cYou brought her back to life.\u201d"}, "90": {"Name": "PART IV THE RAVINE-Chapter 90", "Page Content": " 0 \nBryce\u2019s entire body trembled as she leaned against the glowing quartz of\nthe Gate, exhaustion rooting her to the spot.\nIt had worked. Somehow, it had worked.\nShe didn\u2019t let herself marvel over it\u2014or dread its implications, when\nher father and the Asteri found out. Not when she had no idea how long her\nstarlight would remain glowing in the Gate. But maybe it would hold long\nenough for help to come. Maybe this had made a difference.\nMaybe she had made a difference.\nEach breath burned in her chest. Not much longer now. For help to\ncome, for her end, she didn\u2019t know.\nBut it would be soon. Whichever way it ended, Bryce knew it would\nbe soon.\n\u201cDeclan says Bryce is still at the Old Square Gate,\u201d Fury reported over a\nshoulder.\nHunt just kept his eyes on the star-filled horizon. The city was a dark\nshadow, interrupted only by a faint glowing in its heart. The Old Square\nGate. Bryce.\n\u201cAnd Hypaxia says Bryce can barely move,\u201d Fury added, a note of\nsurprise in her flat voice. \u201cIt looks like she\u2019s drained. She\u2019s not going to be\nable to get to the next Gate without help.\u201d\n\u201cBut the light from the Gate is keeping her safe?\u201d Ruhn called over the\nwind.\n\u201cUntil the demons stop fearing the Starborn light.\u201d Fury switched the\ncall to the helicopter\u2019s speakers. \u201cEmmet, radar\u2019s picking up three war\nmachines from the west. Any read on them?\u201d\nThank fuck. Someone else was coming to help after all. If they could\nbring Bryce to each Gate and she could just muster enough starlight to flow\nthrough the Horn, they\u2019d stop the carnage.\nDeclan took a moment to reply, his voice crackling through the\nspeakers above Hunt. \u201cThey\u2019re registering as imperial tanks.\u201d His pause\nhad Hunt\u2019s grip tightening on the gunner.\nHypaxia clarified, \u201cIt\u2019s the Asterian Guard. With brimstone missile\nlaunchers.\u201d Her voice sharpened as she said to the Autumn King and Prime\nof the wolves, \u201cGet your forces out of the city.\u201d\nThe blood in Hunt\u2019s veins went cold.\nThe Asteri had sent someone to deal with the demons. And with Bryce.\nThey were going to blast the city into dust.\nThe brimstone missiles weren\u2019t ordinary bombs of chemicals and\nmetal. They were pure magic, made by the Asterian Guard: a combination\nof their angelic powers of wind and rain and fire into one hyperconcentrated\nentity, bound with firstlight and fired through machinery. Where they\nstruck, destruction bloomed.\nTo make them even deadlier, they were laced with spells to slow\nhealing. Even for Vanir. The only comfort for any on their receiving end\nwas that the missiles took a while to make, offering reprieve between\nrounds. A small, fool\u2019s comfort.\nFury flicked buttons on the switchboard. \u201cCopy Asterian Units One,\nTwo, and Three, this is Fury Axtar speaking. Pull back.\u201d No answer. \u201cI\nrepeat, pull back. Abort mission.\u201d\nNothing. Declan said, \u201cThey\u2019re the Asterian Guard. They won\u2019t\nanswer to you.\u201d\nThe Autumn King\u2019s voice crackled through the speakers. \u201cNo one at\nImperial Command is answering our calls.\u201d\nFury angled the helicopter, sweeping southward. Hunt saw them then.\nThe black tanks breaking over the horizon, each as large as a small house.\nThe imperial insignia painted on their flanks. All three gunning for Crescent\nCity.\nThey halted just outside its border. The metal launchers atop them\nangled into position.\nThe brimstone missiles shot from the launchers and arced over the\nwalls, blazing with golden light. As the first of them hit, he prayed that\nBryce had left the Gate to find shelter.\nBryce choked on dust and debris, chest heaving. She tried to move\u2014and\nfailed. Her spine\u2014\nNo, that was her leg, pinned in a tangle of concrete and iron. She\u2019d\nheard the boom a minute ago, recognized the golden, arcing plume as\nbrimstone thanks to news coverage of the Pangeran wars, and had sprinted\nhalfway across the square, aiming for the open door of the brick music hall\nthere, hoping it had a basement, when it hit.\nHer ears were roaring, buzzing. Shrieking.\nThe Gate still stood, still shielded her with its light. Her light,\ntechnically.\nThe nearest brimstone missile had hit a neighborhood away, it seemed.\nIt had been enough to trash the square, to reduce some buildings to rubble,\nbut not enough to decimate it.\nMove. She had to move. The other Gates still lay open. She had to find\nsome way to get there; shut them, too.\nShe tugged at her leg. To her surprise, the minor wounds were already\nhealing\u2014far faster than she\u2019d ever experienced. Maybe the Horn in her\nback helped speed it along.\nShe reached forward to haul the concrete slab off her. It didn\u2019t budge.\nShe panted through her teeth, trying again. They\u2019d unleashed\nbrimstone upon the city. The Asterian Guard had blindly fired it over the\nwalls to either destroy the Gates or kill the demons. But they\u2019d fired on\ntheir own people, not caring who they hit\u2014\nBryce took deep, steadying breaths. It did nothing to settle her.\nShe tried again, fingernails cracking on the concrete. But short of\ncutting off her foot, she wasn\u2019t getting free.\nThe Asterian Guard was reloading their missile launchers atop the tanks.\nHyperconcentrated magic flared around them, as if the brimstone was\nstraining to be free of its firstlight constraints. Eager to unleash angelic ruin\nupon the helpless city.\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to fire again,\u201d Ruhn whispered.\n\u201cThe brimstone landed mostly in Moonwood,\u201d Declan told them.\n\u201cBryce is alive but in trouble. She\u2019s trapped under a piece of concrete.\nStruggling like Hel to free herself, though.\u201d\nFury screamed into the microphone, \u201cABORT MISSION.\u201d\nNo one answered. The launchers cocked skyward again, pivoting to\nnew targets.\nAs if they knew Bryce still lived. They\u2019d keep bombarding the city\nuntil she was dead, killing anything in their path. Perhaps hoping that if\nthey took out the Gates, too, the voids would vanish.\nAn icy, brutal calm settled over Hunt.\nHe said to Fury, \u201cGo high. High as the helicopter can handle.\u201d\nShe saw what he intended. He couldn\u2019t fly, not on weak wings. But he\ndidn\u2019t need to.\n\u201cGrab something,\u201d Fury said, and angled the helicopter sharply. It\nwent up, up, up, all of them gritting their teeth against the weight trying to\nshove them earthward.\nHunt braced himself, settling into that place that had seen him through\nbattles and years in dungeons and Sandriel\u2019s arena.\n\u201cGet ready, Athalar,\u201d Fury called. The war machines halted, launchers\nprimed.\nThe helicopter flew over Lunathion\u2019s walls. Hunt unstrapped himself\nfrom the gunner. The Bone Quarter was a misty swirl below as they crossed\nthe Istros.\nGratitude shone in Danaan\u2019s eyes. Understanding what only Hunt\ncould do.\nThe Old Square and glowing Gate at its heart became visible. The only\nsignal he needed. There was no hesitation in Hunt. No fear.\nHunt leapt out of the helicopter, his wings tucked in tight. A one-way\nticket. His last flight.\nFar below, his sharp eyes could just make out Bryce as she curled\nherself into a ball, as if it\u2019d save her from the death soon to blast her apart.\nThe brimstone missiles launched one after another after another, the\nclosest arcing toward the Old Square, shimmering with lethal golden power.\nEven as Hunt plunged to the earth, he knew its angle was off\u2014it\u2019d strike\nprobably ten blocks away. But it was still too close. Still left her in the blast\nzone, where all that compressed angelic power would splatter her apart.\nThe brimstone hit, the entire city bouncing beneath its unholy impact.\nBlock after block ruptured in a tidal wave of death.\nWings splaying, lightning erupting, Hunt threw himself over Bryce as\nthe world shattered."}, "91": {"Name": "PART IV THE RAVINE-Chapter 91", "Page Content": " 1 \nShe should be dead.\nBut those were her fingers, curling on the rubble. That was her breath,\nsawing in and out.\nThe brimstone had decimated the square, the city was now in\nsmoldering ruins, yet the Gate still stood. Her light had gone out, though,\nthe quartz again an icy white. Fires sputtered around her, lighting the\ndamage in flickering relief.\nClumps of ashes rained down, mixing with the embers.\nBryce\u2019s ears buzzed faintly, yet not as badly as they had after the first\nblast.\nIt wasn\u2019t possible. She\u2019d spied the shimmering golden brimstone\nmissile arcing past, knew it\u2019d strike a few blocks away, and that death\nwould soon find her. The Gate must have shielded her, somehow.\nBryce eased into a kneeling position with a groan. The bombardment,\nat least, had ceased. Only a few buildings stood. The skeletons of cars still\nburned around her. The acrid smoke rose in a column that blotted out the\nfirst of the evening stars.\nAnd\u2014and in the shadows, those were stirring demons. Bile burned her\nthroat. She had to get up. Had to move while they were down.\nHer legs wouldn\u2019t cooperate. She wiggled her toes inside her sneakers,\njust to make sure they could work, but \u2026 she couldn\u2019t rise off the ground.\nHer body refused to obey.\nA clump of ash landed on the torn knee of her leggings.\nHer hands began to shake. It wasn\u2019t a piece of ash.\nIt was a gray feather.\nBryce twisted to look behind herself. Her head emptied out. A scream\nbroke from her, rising from so deep that she wondered if it was the sound of\nthe world shredding apart.\nHunt lay sprawled on the ground, his back a bloodied, burned mess,\nand his legs \u2026\nThere was nothing left of them but ribbons. Nothing left of his right\narm but splattered blood on pavement. And through his back, where his\nwings had been\u2014\nThat was a bloody, gaping hole.\nShe moved on instinct, scrambling over concrete and metal and blood.\nHe\u2019d shielded her against the brimstone. Had somehow escaped\nSandriel and come here. To save her.\n\u201cPleasepleasepleaseplease\u201d\nShe turned him over, searching for any hint of life, of breathing\u2014\nHis mouth moved. Just slightly.\nBryce sobbed, pulling his head into her lap. \u201cHelp!\u201d she called. No\nanswer beyond an unearthly baying in the fire-licked darkness. \u201cHelp!\u201d she\nyelled again, but her voice was so hoarse it barely carried across the square.\nRandall had told her about the terrible power of the Asterian Guard\u2019s\nbrimstone missiles. How the spells woven into the condensed angelic magic\nslowed healing in Vanir long enough for them to bleed out. To die.\nBlood coated so much of Hunt\u2019s face that she could barely see the skin\nbeneath. Only the faint flutter of his throat told her he still lived.\nAnd the wounds that should have been healing \u2026 they leaked and\ngushed blood. Arteries had been severed. Vital arteries\u2014\n\u201cHELP!\u201d she screamed.\nBut no one answered.\nThe brimstone\u2019s blasts had downed the helicopter.\nOnly Fury\u2019s skill kept them alive, though they\u2019d still crashed, flipping\ntwice, before landing somewhere in Moonwood.\nTharion bled from his head, Fury had a gash in her leg, Flynn and\nAmelie both bore broken bones, and Ruhn \u2026 He didn\u2019t bother to think\nabout his own wounds. Not as the smoke-filled, burning night became laced\nwith approaching snarls. But the brimstone had halted\u2014at least they had\nthat. He prayed the Asterian Guard would need a good while before they\ncould muster the power to form more of them.\nRuhn forced himself into movement by sheer will.\nTwo of the duffels of weapons had come free of their bindings and\nbeen lost in the crash. Flynn and Fury began divvying out the remaining\nguns and knives, working quickly while Ruhn assessed the state of the one\nintact machine gun he\u2019d ripped from the chopper\u2019s floor.\nHypaxia\u2019s voice cracked over the miraculously undamaged radio, \u201cWe\nhave eyes on the Old Square Gate,\u201d she said. Ruhn paused, waiting for the\nnews. Not daring to hope.\nThe last Ruhn had seen of Athalar was the angel plunging toward\nBryce while the Asterian Guard fired those glowing golden missiles over\nthe walls like some sick fireworks show. Then the citywide explosions had\nsundered the world.\n\u201cAthalar is down,\u201d Declan announced gravely. \u201cBryce lives.\u201d Ruhn\noffered up a silent prayer of thanks to Cthona for her mercy. Another pause.\n\u201cCorrection, Athalar made it, but barely. His injuries are \u2026 Shit.\u201d His\nswallow was audible. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any chance of survival.\u201d\nTharion cocked a rifle to his shoulder, peering through the scope into\nthe darkness. \u201cWe\u2019ve got about a dozen demons sizing us up from that brick\nbuilding over there.\u201d\n\u201cSix more over here,\u201d Fury said, also using the scope on her rifle.\nAmelie Ravenscroft limped badly as she shifted into wolf form with a flash\nof light and bared her teeth at the darkness.\nIf they didn\u2019t shut the portals in the other Gates, only two options\nexisted: retreat or death.\n\u201cThey\u2019re getting curious,\u201d Flynn murmured without taking his eye\nfrom the scope of his gun. \u201cDo we have a plan?\u201d\n\u201cThe river\u2019s at our backs,\u201d Tharion said. \u201cIf we\u2019re lucky, my people\nmight come to our aid.\u201d The Blue Court lay far enough below the surface to\nhave avoided the brimstone\u2019s wrath. They could rally.\nBut Bryce and Hunt remained in the Old Square. Ruhn said, \u201cWe\u2019re\nthirty blocks from the Heart Gate. We go down the river-walk, then cut\ninland at Main.\u201d He added, \u201cThat\u2019s where I\u2019m headed, at least.\u201d They all\nnodded, grim-faced.\nTell Ruhn I forgive him\u2014for all of it.\nThe words echoed through Ruhn\u2019s blood. They had to keep going,\neven if the demons picked them off one by one. He just hoped they\u2019d reach\nhis sister in time to find something to save.\nBryce knelt over Hunt, his life spilling out all around her. And in the\nsmoldering, acrid quiet, she began whispering.\n\u201cI believe it happened for a reason. I believe it all happened for a\nreason.\u201d She stroked his bloody hair, her voice shaking. \u201cI believe it wasn\u2019t\nfor nothing.\u201d\nShe looked toward the Gate. Gently set Hunt down amid the rubble.\nShe whispered again, rising to her feet, \u201cI believe it happened for a reason. I\nbelieve it all happened for a reason. I believe it wasn\u2019t for nothing.\u201d\nShe walked from Hunt\u2019s body as he bled behind her. Wended her way\nthrough the debris and rubble. The fence around the Gate had been warped,\npeeled away. But the quartz archway still stood, its bronze plaque and the\ndial pad\u2019s gems intact as she halted before them.\nBryce whispered again, \u201cI believe it wasn\u2019t for nothing.\u201d\nShe laid her palm on the dial pad\u2019s bronze disk.\nThe metal was warm against Bryce\u2019s fingers, as it had been when\nshe\u2019d touched it that final day with Danika. Its power zinged through her,\nsucking the fee for the usage: a drop of her magic.\nThe Gates had been used as communication devices in the past\u2014but\nthe only reason words could pass between them was the power that\nconnected them. They all sat atop linked ley lines. A veritable matrix of\nenergy.\nThe Gate wasn\u2019t just a prism. It was a conduit. And she had the Horn\nin her very skin. Had proved it could close a portal to Hel.\nBryce whispered into the little intercom in the center of the pad\u2019s arc\nof gems, \u201cHello?\u201d\nNo one answered. She said, \u201cIf you can hear me, come to the Gate.\nAny Gate.\u201d\nStill nothing. She said, \u201cMy name is Bryce Quinlan. I\u2019m in the Old\nSquare. And \u2026 and I think I\u2019ve figured out how we can stop this. How we\ncan fix this.\u201d\nSilence. None of the other gems lit up to indicate the presence or voice\nof another person in another district, touching the disk on their end.\n\u201cI know it\u2019s bad right now,\u201d she tried again. \u201cI know it\u2019s so, so bad,\nand dark, and \u2026 I know it feels impossible. But if you can make it to\nanother Gate, just \u2026 please. Please come.\u201d\nShe took a shuddering breath.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to do anything,\u201d she said. \u201cAll you need to do is just\nput your hand on the disk. That\u2019s all I need\u2014just another person on the\nline.\u201d Her hand shook, and she pressed it harder to the metal. \u201cThe Gate is a\nconduit of power\u2014a lightning rod that feeds into every other Gate\nthroughout the city. And I need someone on the other end, linked to me\nthrough that vein.\u201d She swallowed. \u201cI need someone to Anchor me. So I can\nmake the Drop.\u201d\nThe words whispered out into the world.\nBryce\u2019s rasping voice overrode the sounds of the demons rallying\nagain around her. \u201cThe firstlight I\u2019ll generate by making the Drop will\nspread from this Gate to the others. It\u2019ll light up everything, send those\ndemons racing away. It\u2019ll heal everything it touches. Everyone it touches.\nAnd I\u2014\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cI am Starborn Fae, and I bear Luna\u2019s\nHorn in my body. With the power of the firstlight I generate, I can shut the\nportals to Hel. I did it here\u2014I can do it everywhere else. But I need a link\u2014\nand the power from my Drop to do it.\u201d\nStill no one answered. No life stirred, beyond the beasts in the deepest\nshadows.\n\u201cPlease,\u201d Bryce begged, her voice breaking.\nSilently, she prayed for any one of those six other gems to light up, to\nshow that just one person, in any district, would answer her plea.\nBut there was only the crackling nothingness.\nShe was alone. And Hunt was dying.\nBryce waited five seconds. Ten seconds. No one answered. No one\ncame.\nSwallowing another sob, she took a shuddering breath and let go of the\ndisk.\nHunt\u2019s breaths had grown few and far between. She crawled back to\nhim, hands shaking. But her voice was calm as she again slid his head into\nher lap. Stroked his blood-soaked face. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be all right,\u201d she said.\n\u201cHelp is coming, Hunt. The medwitches are on their way.\u201d She shut her\neyes against her tears. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be all right,\u201d she lied. \u201cWe\u2019re going\nto go home, where Syrinx is waiting for us. We\u2019re going to go home. You\nand me. Together. We\u2019ll have that afterward, like you promised. But only if\nyou hold on, Hunt.\u201d\nHis breathing rattled in his chest. A death rattle. She bent over him,\ninhaling his scent, the strength in him. And then she said it\u2014the three\nwords that meant more than anything. She whispered them into his ear,\nsending them with all she had left in her.\nThe final truth, the one she needed him to hear.\nHunt\u2019s breathing spread and thinned. Not much longer.\nBryce couldn\u2019t stop her tears as they dropped onto Hunt\u2019s cheeks,\ncleaning away the blood in clear tracks.\nLight it up, Danika whispered to her. Into her heart.\n\u201cI tried,\u201d she whispered back. \u201cDanika, I tried.\u201d\nLight it up.\nBryce wept. \u201cIt didn\u2019t work.\u201d\nLight it up. Urgency sharpened the words. As if \u2026 As if \u2026\nBryce lifted her head. Looked toward the Gate. To the plaque and its\ngems.\nShe waited. Counted her breaths. One. Two. Three.\nThe gems remained dark. Four. Five. Six.\nNothing at all. Bryce swallowed hard and turned back to Hunt. One\nlast time. He\u2019d go, and then she\u2019d follow, once more brimstone fell or the\ndemons worked up the courage to attack her.\nShe took another breath. Seven.\n\u201cLight it up.\u201d The words filled the Old Square. Filled every square in\nthe city.\nBryce whipped her head around to look at the Gate as Danika\u2019s voice\nsounded again. \u201cLight it up, Bryce.\u201d\nThe onyx stone of the Bone Quarter glowed like a dark star."}, "92": {"Name": "PART IV THE RAVINE-Chapter 92", "Page Content": " 2 \nBryce\u2019s face crumpled as she lurched to her feet, sprinting to the Gate.\nShe didn\u2019t care how it was possible as Danika said again, \u201cLight it up.\u201d\nThen Bryce was laughing and sobbing as she screamed, \u201cLIGHT IT\nUP, DANIKA! LIGHT IT UP, LIGHT IT UP, LIGHT IT UP!\u201d\nBryce slammed her palm onto the bronze disk of the Gate.\nAnd soul to soul with the friend whom she had not forgotten, the friend\nwho had not forgotten her, even in death, Bryce made the Drop.\nStunned silence filled the conference room as Bryce plunged into her\npower.\nDeclan Emmett didn\u2019t look up from the feeds he monitored, his heart\nthundering.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not possible,\u201d the Autumn King said. Declan was inclined to\nagree.\nSabine Fendyr murmured, \u201cDanika had a small kernel of energy left,\nthe Under-King said. A bit of self that remained.\u201d\n\u201cCan a dead soul even serve as an Anchor?\u201d Queen Hypaxia asked.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Jesiba replied, with all the finality of the Under-King\u2019s emissary.\n\u201cNo, it can\u2019t.\u201d\nSilence rippled through the room as they realized what they were\nwitnessing. An untethered, solo Drop. Utter free fall. Bryce might as well\nhave leapt from a cliff and hoped to land safely.\nDeclan drew his eyes from the video feed and scanned the graph on\none of his three computers\u2014the one charting Bryce\u2019s Drop, courtesy of the\nEleusian system. \u201cShe\u2019s approaching her power level.\u201d Barely a blip past\nzero on the scale.\nHypaxia peered over his shoulder to study the graph. \u201cShe\u2019s not\nslowing, though.\u201d\nDeclan squinted at the screen. \u201cShe\u2019s gaining speed.\u201d He shook his\nhead. \u201cBut\u2014but she\u2019s classified as a low-level.\u201d Near-negligible, if he felt\nlike being a dick about it.\nHypaxia said quietly, \u201cBut the Gate is not.\u201d\nSabine demanded, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\nHypaxia whispered, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a memorial plaque. On the\nGate.\u201d The witch pointed to the sign mounted on the glowing quartz, the\nbronze stark against the incandescent stone. \u201cThe power shall always\nbelong to those who give their lives to the city.\u201d\nBryce dropped further into power. Past the normal, respectable levels.\nQueen Hypaxia said, \u201cThe plaque is a blessing.\u201d\nDeclan\u2019s breathing was uneven as he murmured, \u201cThe power of the\nGates\u2014the power given over by every soul who has ever touched it \u2026\nevery soul who has handed over a drop of their magic.\u201d\nHe tried and failed to calculate just how many people, over how many\ncenturies, had touched the Gates in the city. Had handed over a drop of their\npower, like a coin tossed in a fountain. Made a wish on that drop of yielded\npower.\nPeople of every House. Every race. Millions and millions of drops of\npower fueled this solo Drop.\nBryce passed level after level after level. The Autumn King\u2019s face\nwent pale.\nHypaxia said, \u201cLook at the Gates.\u201d\nThe quartz Gates across the city began to glow. Red, then orange, then\ngold, then white.\nFirstlight erupted from them. Lines of it speared out in every direction.\nThe lights flowed down the ley lines between the Gates, connecting\nthem along the main avenues. It formed a perfect, six-pointed star.\nThe lines of light began to spread. Curving around the city walls.\nCutting off the demons now aiming for the lands beyond.\nLight met light met light met light.\nUntil the city was ringed with it. Until every street was glowing.\nAnd Bryce was still making the Drop.\nIt was joy and life and death and pain and song and silence.\nBryce tumbled into power, and power tumbled into her, and she didn\u2019t\ncare, didn\u2019t care, didn\u2019t care, because it was Danika falling with her, Danika\nlaughing with her as their souls twined.\nShe was here, she was here, she was here\u2014\nBryce plunged into the golden light and song at the heart of the\nuniverse.\nDanika let out a howl of joy, and Bryce echoed it.\nDanika was here. It was enough.\n\u201cShe\u2019s passing Ruhn\u2019s level,\u201d Declan breathed, not believing it. That his\nfriend\u2019s party-girl sister had surpassed the prince himself. Surpassed Ruhn\nfucking Danaan.\nDeclan\u2019s king was still as death as Bryce smashed past Ruhn\u2019s ranking.\nThis could change their very order. A powerful half-human princess with a\nstar\u2019s light in her veins \u2026 Fucking Hel.\nBryce began slowing at last. Nearing the Autumn King\u2019s level. Declan\nswallowed.\nThe city was awash with her light. Demons fled from it, racing back\nthrough the voids, opting to brave the glowing Gates rather than be trapped\nin Midgard.\nLight shot up from the Gates, seven bolts becoming one in the heart of\nthe city\u2014above the Old Square Gate. A highway of power. Of Bryce\u2019s will.\nThe voids between Midgard and Hel began to shrink. As if the light\nitself was abhorrent. As if that pure, unrestrained firstlight could heal the\nworld.\nAnd it did. Buildings shattered by brimstone slid back into place.\nRubble gathered into walls and streets and fountains. Wounded people\nbecame whole again.\nBryce slowed further.\nDeclan ground his teeth. The voids within the Gates became smaller\nand smaller.\nDemons rushed back to Hel through the shrinking doorways. More and\nmore of the city healed as the Horn closed the portals. As Bryce sealed the\nportals, the Horn\u2019s power flowing through her, amplified by the firstlight\nshe was generating.\n\u201cHoly gods,\u201d someone was whispering.\nThe voids between worlds became slivers. Then nothing at all.\nThe Gates stood empty. The portals gone.\nBryce stopped at last. Declan studied the precise number of her power,\njust a decimal point above that of the Autumn King.\nDeclan let out a soft laugh, wishing Ruhn were here to see the male\u2019s\nshocked expression.\nThe Autumn King\u2019s face tightened and he growled at Declan, \u201cI would\nnot be so smug, boy.\u201d\nDeclan tensed. \u201cWhy?\u201d\nThe Autumn King hissed, \u201cBecause that girl may have used the Gates\u2019\npower to Drop to unforeseen levels, but she will not be able to make the\nAscent.\u201d\nDeclan\u2019s fingers stilled on the keys of his laptop.\nThe Autumn King laughed mirthlessly. Not from malice, Declan\nrealized\u2014but something like pain. He\u2019d never known the prick could feel\nsuch a thing.\nBryce slumped to the stones beside the Gate. Declan didn\u2019t need\nmedical monitors to know her heart had flatlined.\nHer mortal body had died.\nA clock on the computer showing the Eleusian system began counting\ndown from a six-minute marker. The indicator of how long she had to make\nthe Search and the Ascent, to let her mortal, aging body die, to face what\nlay within her soul, and race back up to life, into her full power. And\nemerge an immortal.\nIf she made the Ascent, the Eleusian system would register it, track it.\nThe Autumn King said hoarsely, \u201cShe made the Drop alone. Danika\nFendyr is dead\u2014she is not a true Anchor. Bryce has no way back to life.\u201d"}, "93": {"Name": "PART IV THE RAVINE-Chapter 93", "Page Content": " 3 \nThis was the cradle of all life, this place.\nThere was a physical ground beneath her, and she had the sense of an\nentire world above her, full of distant, twinkling lights. But this was the\nbottom of the sea. The dark trench that cut through the skin of the earth.\nIt didn\u2019t matter. Nothing mattered at all. Not with Danika standing\nbefore her. Holding her.\nBryce peeled away far enough to look at her beautiful, angular face.\nThe corn-silk hair. It was the same, right down to the amethyst, sapphire,\nand rose streaks. She\u2019d somehow forgotten the exact features of Danika\u2019s\nface, but \u2026 there they were.\nBryce said, \u201cYou came.\u201d\nDanika\u2019s smile was soft. \u201cYou asked for help.\u201d\n\u201cAre you \u2026 are you alive?

This is you.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d Danika peered at the churning darkness above them, the entire\nocean above. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t have much time to make the Ascent, Bryce.\u201d\nBryce snorted. \u201cI\u2019m not making the Ascent.\u201d\nDanika blinked. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\nBryce stepped back. \u201cI\u2019m not making it.\u201d Because this was where her\nhomeless soul would stay, if she failed. Her body would die in the world\nabove, and her soul that she\u2019d traded away to the Under-King would be left\nto wander this place. With Danika.\nDanika crossed her arms. \u201cWhy?\u201d\nBryce blinked furiously. \u201cBecause it got too hard. Without you. It is\ntoo hard without you.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit,\u201d Danika snarled. \u201cSo you\u2019ll just give up on\neverything? Bryce, I am dead. I am gone. And you\u2019ll trade your entire life\nfor this tiny piece of me that\u2019s left?\u201d Disappointment shuttered her caramel\neyes. \u201cThe friend I knew wouldn\u2019t have done that.\u201d\nBryce\u2019s voice broke as she said, \u201cWe were supposed to do this\ntogether. We were supposed to live out our lives together.\u201d\nDanika\u2019s face softened. \u201cI know, B.\u201d She took her hand. \u201cBut that\u2019s not\nhow it turned out.\u201d\nBryce bowed her head, thinking she\u2019d crack apart. \u201cI miss you. Every\nmoment of every day.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Danika said again, and put a hand over her heart. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve\nfelt it. I\u2019ve seen it.\u201d\n\u201cWhy did you lie\u2014about the Horn?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t lie,\u201d Danika said simply. \u201cI just didn\u2019t tell you.\u201d\n\u201cYou lied about the tattoo,\u201d Bryce countered.\n\u201cTo keep you safe,\u201d Danika said. \u201cTo keep the Horn safe, yeah, but\nmostly to keep you safe in case the worst happened to me.\u201d\n\u201cWell, the worst did happen to you,\u201d Bryce said, instantly regretting it\nwhen Danika flinched.\nBut then Danika said, \u201cYou traded your place in the Bone Quarter for\nme.\u201d\nBryce began crying. \u201cIt was the least I could do.\u201d\nTears formed in Danika\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou didn\u2019t think I\u2019d make it?\u201d She\nthrew her a sharp, pained grin. \u201cAsshole.\u201d\nBut Bryce shook with the force of her weeping. \u201cI couldn\u2019t \u2026 I\ncouldn\u2019t take that risk.\u201d\nDanika brushed back a piece of Bryce\u2019s hair.\nBryce sniffled and said, \u201cI killed Micah for what he did. To you. To\nLehabah.\u201d Her heart strained. \u201cIs\u2014is she over in the Bone Quarter?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. And yeah\u2014I saw what happened in the gallery.\u201d\nDanika didn\u2019t explain more about the particulars. \u201cWe all saw.\u201d\nThat word snagged. We.\nBryce\u2019s lips trembled. \u201cIs Connor with you?\u201d\n\u201cHe is. And the rest of the pack. They bought me time with the\nReapers. To get to the Gate. They\u2019re holding them off, but not for long,\nBryce. I can\u2019t stay here with you.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cConnor would\nhave wanted more for you than this.\u201d She stroked the back of Bryce\u2019s hand\nwith her thumb. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have wanted you to stop fighting.\u201d\nBryce wiped at her face again. \u201cI didn\u2019t. Not until now. But now I\u2019m\n\u2026 It\u2019s all just fucked. And I\u2019m so tired of it feeling that way. I\u2019m done.\u201d\nDanika asked softly, \u201cWhat about the angel?\u201d\nBryce\u2019s head snapped up. \u201cWhat about him?\u201d\nDanika gave her a knowing smile. \u201cIf you want to ignore the fact that\nyou\u2019ve got your family who loves you no matter what, fine\u2014but the angel\nremains.\u201d\nBryce withdrew her hand from Danika\u2019s. \u201cYou\u2019re really trying to\nconvince me to make the Ascent for a guy?\u201d\n\u201cIs Hunt Athalar really just some guy to you?\u201d Danika\u2019s smile turned\ngentle. \u201cAnd why is it somehow a mark against your strength to admit that\nthere is someone, who happens to be male, worth returning to? Someone\nwho I know made you feel like things are far from fucked.\u201d\nBryce crossed her arms. \u201cSo what.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s healed, Bryce,\u201d Danika said. \u201cYou healed him with the\nfirstlight.\u201d\nBryce\u2019s breath shuddered out of her. She\u2019d done all of this for that wild\nhope.\nShe swallowed, looking at the ground that was not earth, but the very\nbase of Self, of the world. She whispered, \u201cI\u2019m scared.\u201d\nDanika grabbed her hand again. \u201cThat\u2019s the point of it, Bryce. Of life.\nTo live, to love, knowing that it might all vanish tomorrow. It makes\neverything that much more precious.\u201d She took Bryce\u2019s face in her hands\nand pressed their brows together.\nBryce closed her eyes and inhaled Danika\u2019s scent, somehow still\npresent even in this form. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can make it. Back up.\u201d\nDanika pulled away, peering at the impossible distance overhead. Then\nat the road that stretched before them. The runway. Its end was a free fall\ninto eternal darkness. Into nothingness. But she said, \u201cJust try, Bryce. One\ntry. I\u2019ll be with you every step of the way. Even if you can\u2019t see me. I will\nalways be with you.\u201d\nBryce didn\u2019t look at that too-short runway. The endless ocean above\nthem, separating her from life. She just memorized the lines of Danika\u2019s\nface, as she had not had the chance to do before. \u201cI love you, Danika,\u201d she\nwhispered.\nDanika\u2019s throat bobbed. She cocked her head, the movement purely\nlupine. As if listening to something. \u201cBryce, you have to hurry.\u201d She\ngrabbed her hand, squeezing. \u201cYou have to decide now.\u201d\nThe timer on Bryce\u2019s life showed two minutes left.\nHer dead body lay sprawled on the stones beside the faintly glowing\nGate.\nDeclan ran a hand over his chest. He didn\u2019t dare contact Ruhn. Not yet.\nCouldn\u2019t bear to.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way to help her?\u201d Hypaxia whispered to the silent room.\n\u201cNo way at all?\u201d\nNo. Declan had used the past four minutes to run a search of every\npublic and private database in Midgard for a miracle. He\u2019d found nothing.\n\u201cBeyond being without an Anchor,\u201d the Autumn King said, \u201cshe used\nan artificial power source to bring her to that level. Her body is not\nbiologically equipped to make the Ascent. Even with a true Anchor, she\nwouldn\u2019t be able to gain enough momentum for that first jump upward.\u201d\nJesiba gravely nodded her confirmation, but the sorceress said nothing.\nDeclan\u2019s memories of his Drop and Ascent were murky, frightening.\nHe\u2019d gone farther than anticipated, but had at least stayed within his own\nrange. Even with Flynn Anchoring him, he\u2019d been petrified he wouldn\u2019t\nmake it back.\nDespite registering on the system as a blip of energy beside Bryce,\nDanika Fendyr was not a tether to life, not a true Anchor. She had no life of\nher own. Danika was merely the thing that had given Bryce enough courage\nto attempt the Drop alone.\nThe Autumn King went on, \u201cI\u2019ve looked. I\u2019ve spent centuries looking.\nThousands of people throughout the ages have attempted to go past their\nown intended levels through artificial means. None of them ever made it\nback to life.\u201d\nOne minute remained, the seconds flying off the countdown clock.\nBryce had still not Ascended. Was still making the Search, facing\nwhatever lay within her. The timer would have halted if she had begun her\nattempt at the Ascent, marking her entrance into the Between\u2014the liminal\nplace between death and life. But the timer kept going. Winding down.\nIt didn\u2019t matter, though. Bryce would die whether she attempted it or\nnot.\nThirty seconds left. The remaining dignitaries in the room bowed their\nheads.\nTen seconds. The Autumn King rubbed at his face, then watched the\nclock count down. The remainder of Bryce\u2019s life.\nFive. Four. Three. Two.\nOne. The milliseconds raced toward zero. True death.\nThe clock stopped at 0.003.\nA red line shot across the bottom of the Eleusian system\u2019s graph, along\nthe runway toward oblivion.\nDeclan whispered, \u201cShe\u2019s running.\u201d\n\u201cFaster, Bryce!\u201d Danika raced at her heels.\nStep after step after step, Bryce barreled down that mental runway.\nToward the ever-nearing end of it.\n\u201cFaster!\u201d Danika roared.\nOne shot. She had one shot at this.\nBryce ran. Ran and ran and ran, arms pumping, gritting her teeth.\nThe odds were impossible, the likelihood slim.\nBut she tried. With Danika beside her, this last time, she could try.\nShe had made the Drop solo, but she was not alone.\nShe had never been alone. She never would be.\nNot with Danika in her heart, and not with Hunt beside her.\nThe end of the runway neared. She had to get airborne. Had to start the\nAscent, or she\u2019d fall into nothingness. Forever.\n\u201cDon\u2019t stop!\u201d Danika screamed.\nSo Bryce didn\u2019t.\nShe charged onward. Toward that very final, deadly end point.\nShe used every foot of the runway. Every last inch.\nAnd then blasted upward.\nDeclan couldn\u2019t believe what he was seeing as the Autumn King fell to his\nknees. As Bryce rose, lifted on a surge of power.\nShe cleared the deepest levels.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not \u2026,\u201d the Autumn King breathed. \u201cIt\u2019s not possible. She is\nalone.\u201d\nTears streamed down Sabine\u2019s harsh face as she whispered, \u201cNo, she\nisn\u2019t.\u201d\nThe force that was Danika Fendyr, the force that had given Bryce that\nboost upward, faded away into nothing.\nDeclan knew it would never return, in this world or on a mist-veiled\nisle.\nIt might still have been too long for Bryce\u2019s brain to be without\noxygen, even if she could make it the entire way back to life. But his\nprincess fought for every bit of progress upward, her power shifting, traces\nof everyone who\u2019d given it to her coming through: mer, shifter, draki,\nhuman, angel, sprite, Fae \u2026\n\u201cHow,\u201d the Autumn King asked no one in particular. \u201cHow?\u201d\nIt was the ancient Prime of the wolves who answered, his withered\nvoice rising above the pinging of the graph. \u201cWith the strength of the most\npowerful force in the world. The most powerful force in any realm.\u201d He\npointed to the screen. \u201cWhat brings loyalty beyond death, undimming\ndespite the years. What remains unwavering in the face of hopelessness.\u201d\nThe Autumn King twisted toward the ancient Prime, shaking his head.\nStill not understanding.\nBryce was at the level of ordinary witches now. But still too far from\nlife.\nMotion caught Declan\u2019s eye, and he whirled toward the feed of the Old\nSquare.\nWreathed in lightning, healed and whole, Hunt Athalar was kneeling\nover Bryce\u2019s dead body. Pumping her torso with his hands\u2014chest\ncompressions.\nHunt hissed to Bryce through his gritted teeth, thunder cracking above\nhim, \u201cI heard what you said.\u201d Pump, pump, pump went his powerful arms.\n\u201cWhat you waited to admit until I was almost dead, you fucking coward.\u201d\nHis lightning surged into her, sending her body arcing off the ground as he\ntried to jump-start her heart. He snarled in her ear, \u201cNow come say it to my\nface.\u201d\nSabine whispered a sentence to the room, to the Autumn King, and\nDeclan\u2019s heart rose, hearing it.\nIt was the answer to the ancient Prime\u2019s words. To the Autumn King\u2019s\nquestion of how, against every statistic blaring on Declan\u2019s computer, they\nwere even witnessing Hunt Athalar fight like Hel to keep Bryce Quinlan\u2019s\nheart beating.\nThrough love, all is possible."}, "94": {"Name": "PART IV THE RAVINE-Chapter 94", "Page Content": " 4 \nShe was sea and sky and stone and blood and wings and earth and stars and\ndarkness and light and bone and flame.\nDanika was gone.

But of challenge.\nBryce barreled higher. She could feel the surface nearby. The thin veil\nbetween this place and life. Her power shifted, dancing between forms and\ngifts. She thrust upward with a push of a mighty tail. Twisted and rose with\na sweep of vast wings. She was all things\u2014and yet herself.\nAnd then she heard it. His voice. His answering challenge to her call.\nHe was there. Waiting for her.\nFighting to keep her heart going. She was close enough to the veil to\nsee it now.\nEven before she had come to lie dead before him, he\u2019d fought to keep\nher heart going.\nBryce smiled, in this place between, and at last careened toward Hunt.\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Hunt grunted, continuing the chest compressions, counting\nBryce\u2019s breaths until he could shock her again with his lighting.\nHe didn\u2019t know how long she had been down, but she\u2019d been dead\nwhen he\u2019d awoken, healed and whole, to a repaired city.

And\nwhen he\u2019d seen her lifeless body before the Gate, he\u2019d known she\u2019d\nsomehow found a way to make the Drop, to unleash that healing firstlight,\nto use the Horn to seal the portals to Hel at the other Gates.\nSo he\u2019d acted on instinct.

And her heart was beating.\nBoth were secondary. Would always be secondary around Hunt.\nShe dimly registered that they were kneeling in the Old Square. His\ngray wings glowed like embers as they curved around them both, holding\nher tightly to him. And inside the wall of velvet-soft wings, like a sun\ncontained inside a flower bud, Bryce shone.\nShe slowly lifted her head, pulling away only far enough to look at his\nface.\nHunt already stared down at her, his wings unfurling like petals at\ndawn. No tattoo marked his brow. The halo was gone.\nShe ran her shaking fingers over the smooth skin. Hunt silently\nbrushed away her tears.\nShe smiled at him. Smiled at him with the lightness in her heart, her\nsoul. Hunt slid his hand along her jaw, cupping her face. The tenderness in\nhis eyes wiped away any lingering doubts.\nShe laid her palm over his thundering heart. \u201cDid you just call me a\nfucking coward?\u201d\nHunt tipped his head to the stars and laughed. \u201cSo what if I did?\u201d\nShe angled her face closer to his. \u201cToo bad all that healing firstlight\ndidn\u2019t turn you into a decent person.\u201d\n\u201cWhere would the fun be in that, Quinlan?\u201d\nHer toes curled at the way he said her name. \u201cI suppose I\u2019ll just have\nto\u2014\u201d\nA door opened down the street.

Not one void\nremained in the Gates. And her firstlight\u2014through those Gates\u2014had been\nable to heal everything: people, buildings, the world itself.\nYet it could not do the impossible. It could not bring back the dead.\nAnd there were many, many bodies in the streets. Most only in pieces.\nBryce tightened her arms around Sryinx. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she whispered,\nletting him lick her face.\nBut it wasn\u2019t okay. Not even close. What had happened, what she\u2019d\ndone and revealed, the Horn in her body, all those people dead, Lehabah\ndead, and seeing Danika, Danika, Danika\u2014\nHer breathless words turned into pants, and then shuddering sobs.\nHunt, standing behind her as if he\u2019d been waiting for this, just scooped her\nand Syrinx into his arms.\nHunt brought her to her bedroom, sitting down on the edge of the\nmattress, keeping his arms around her and Syrinx, who pried his way free\nfrom Bryce\u2019s arms to lick Hunt\u2019s face, too.\nHis hand slipped into her hair, fingers twining through it, and Bryce\nleaned into him, soaking up that strength, that familiar scent, marveling that\nthey had even gotten here, had somehow made it\u2014\nShe glanced at his wrist. No sign of the halo on his brow, yet the slave\ntattoo remained.\nHunt noticed the shift in her attention. He said quietly, \u201cI killed\nSandriel.\u201d\nHis eyes were so calm\u2014clear. Fixed wholly on hers.\n\u201cI killed Micah,\u201d she whispered.\n\u201cI know.\u201d The corner of his mouth curled upward. \u201cRemind me to\nnever get on your bad side.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not funny.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I know it\u2019s not.\u201d His fingers drifted through her hair, casually and\ngently. \u201cI could barely stand to watch.\u201d\nShe could barely stand to remember it. \u201cHow did you manage to kill\nher? To get rid of the tattoo?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long story,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d rather you fill in the details of yours.\u201d\n\u201cYou first.\u201d\n\u201cNot a chance. I want to hear how you hid the fact that you\u2019ve got a\nstar inside you.\u201d\nHe looked down at her chest then, as if he\u2019d glimpse it shimmering\nbeneath her skin. But when his eyebrows flicked upward, Bryce followed\nhis line of sight.\n\u201cWell,\u201d she said with a sigh, \u201cthat\u2019s new.\u201d Indeed, just visible down the\nV-neck of her T-shirt, a white splotch\u2014an eight-pointed star\u2014now scarred\nthe place between her breasts.\nHunt chuckled. \u201cI like it.\u201d\nSome small part of her did, too. But she said, \u201cYou know it\u2019s just the\nStarborn light\u2014not true power.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, except now you\u2019ve got that, too.\u201d He pinched her side. \u201cA good\namount from what I can sense. And the fucking Horn\u2014\u201d He ran his hand\ndown her spine for emphasis.\nShe rolled her eyes. \u201cWhatever.\u201d\nBut his face grew grave. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to learn to control it.\u201d\n\u201cWe save the city, and you\u2019re already telling me I need to get back to\nwork?\u201d\nHe chuckled. \u201cOld habits, Bryce.\u201d\nTheir eyes met again, and she glanced at his mouth, so close to hers, so\nperfectly formed. At his eyes, now staring so intently into her own.\nIt had all happened for a reason. She believed that. For this\u2014for him.\nAnd though the path she\u2019d been thrust onto was royally fucked, and\nhad led her through the lightless halls of grief and despair \u2026 Here, here\nbefore her, was light. True light. What she\u2019d raced toward during the\nAscent.\nAnd she wanted to be kissed by that light. Now.\nWanted to kiss him back, and tell Syrinx to go wait in his crate for a\nwhile.\nHunt\u2019s dark eyes turned near-feral. As if he could read those thoughts\non her face, in her scent. \u201cWe have some unfinished business, Quinlan,\u201d he\nsaid, voice roughening. He threw Syrinx a Look, and the chimera leapt from\nthe bed and trotted out into the hall, lion\u2019s tail waggling as if to say, It\u2019s\nabout time.\nWhen Bryce looked back at Hunt, she found his focus on her lips. And\nbecame hyperaware of the fact that she was sitting across his lap. On her\nbed. From the hardness starting to poke into her backside, she knew he\u2019d\nrealized it, too.\nStill they said nothing as they stared at each other.\nSo Bryce wriggled slightly against his erection, drawing a hiss from\nhim. She huffed a laugh. \u201cI throw one smoldering look at you and you\u2019re\nalready\u2014what was it you said to me a few weeks ago? Hot and bothered?\u201d\nOne of his hands traced down her spine again, intent in every inch of\nit. \u201cI\u2019ve been hot and bothered for you for a long time now.\u201d His hand\nhalted on her waist, his thumb beginning a gentle, torturous stroking along\nher rib cage. With each sweep, the building ache between her legs ratcheted.\nHunt smiled slowly, as if well aware of that. Then he leaned in,\npressing a kiss to the underside of her jaw. He said against her flushed skin,\n\u201cYou ready to do this?\u201d\n\u201cGods, yes,\u201d she breathed. And when he kissed just beneath her ear,\nmaking her back arch slightly, she said, \u201cI recall you promising to fuck me\nuntil I couldn\u2019t remember my own name.\u201d\nHe shifted his hips, grinding his cock into her, searing her even with\nthe clothing still between them. \u201cIf that\u2019s what you want, sweetheart, that\u2019s\nwhat I\u2019ll give you.\u201d\nOh gods. She couldn\u2019t get a solid breath down. Couldn\u2019t think around\nhis roving mouth on her neck and his hands and that massive, beautiful\ncock digging into her. She had to get him inside her. Right now. She needed\nto feel him, needed to have his heat and strength around her. In her.\nBryce shifted to straddle his lap, lining herself up with all of him. She\nmet all of him, satisfied to find his breathing as ragged as her own. His\nhands bracketed her waist, thumbs stroking, stroking, stroking, as if he were\nan engine waiting to roar into movement upon her command.\nBryce leaned in, brushing her mouth over his. Once. Twice.\nHunt began shaking with the force of his restraint as he let her explore\nhis mouth.\nBut she pulled back, meeting his hazy, burning gaze. The words she\nwanted to say clogged in her throat, so she hoped he understood them as she\npressed a kiss to his now-clear brow. Sketched a line of soft, glancing kisses\nover every inch where the tattoo had been.\nHunt slid a shaking hand from her waist and laid it over her thundering\nheart.\nShe swallowed thickly, surprised to find her eyes stinging. Surprised to\nsee silver lining his eyes as well. They had made it; they were here.\nTogether.\nHunt leaned in, slanting his mouth over hers. She met him halfway,\narms snaking around his neck, fingers burying themselves in his thick,\nsilken hair.\nA shrill ringing filled the apartment.\nShe could ignore it, ignore the world\u2014\nCall from \u2026 Home.\nBryce pulled back, panting hard.\n\u201cYou gonna get that?\u201d Hunt\u2019s voice was guttural.\nYes. No. Maybe.\nCall from \u2026 Home.\n\u201cShe\u2019ll just keep calling until I pick up,\u201d Bryce murmured.\nHer limbs were stiff as she peeled herself from Hunt\u2019s lap, his fingers\ntrailing over her back as she stood. She tried not to think about the promise\nin that touch, as if he was as reluctant to let go of her as she was of him.\nShe ran to the great room and picked up the phone before it went to\naudiomail.\n\u201cBryce?\u201d Her mom was crying. It was enough to douse a bucket of ice\nwater over any lingering arousal. \u201cBryce?\u201d\nShe blew out a breath, returned to the bedroom, and threw Hunt an\napologetic look that he waved off before he slumped back on the bed, wings\nrustling. \u201cHi, Mom.\u201d\nHer mom\u2019s sobbing threatened to make her start again, so she kept\nmoving, aiming for her bathroom. She was filthy\u2014her pink sneakers were\nnear-black, her pants torn and bloody, her shirt almost in ruins. Apparently,\nthe firstlight had only gone so far in fixing everything.\n\u201cAre you all right? Are you safe?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Bryce said, turning on the shower. Leaving it on cold. She\npeeled off her clothes. \u201cI\u2019m doing fine.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that water?\u201d\n\u201cMy shower.\u201d\n\u201cYou save a city and make the Drop and can\u2019t even give me your full\nattention?\u201d\nBryce chuckled and put the phone on speaker before setting it on the\nsink. \u201cHow much do you know?\u201d She hissed at the icy blast as she stepped\ninto the spray. But it shocked away any lingering heat between her legs and\nthe heady desire clouding her mind.\n\u201cYour biological father had Declan Emmet call to fill me in on\neverything. I guess the bastard finally realized he owed me that much, at\nleast.\u201d\nBryce turned up the heat at last as she shampooed her hair. \u201cHow\npissed is he?\u201d\n\u201cFurious, I\u2019m sure.\u201d She added, \u201cThe news also just broke a story\nabout\u2014about who your father is.\u201d Bryce could practically hear her mother\ngrinding her teeth. \u201cThey know the exact amount of power you got. As\nmuch as he has, Bryce. More than him. That\u2019s a big deal.\u201d\nBryce tried not to reel at it\u2014where her power had landed her. She\ntucked away that factoid for later. She rinsed the shampoo from her hair,\nreaching for the conditioner. \u201cI know.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you going to do with it?\u201d\n\u201cOpen a chain of beach-themed restaurants.\u201d\n\u201cIt was too much to hope that achieving that much power would give\nyou a sense of dignity.\u201d\nBryce stuck out her tongue even though her mom couldn\u2019t see it, and\nplopped conditioner into her palm. \u201cLook, can we shelve the whole mighty\npower, mighty burdens discussion until tomorrow?\u201d\n\u201cYes, except tomorrow in your vocabulary means never.\u201d Her mother\nsighed. \u201cYou closed those portals, Bryce. And I can\u2019t even talk about what\nDanika did for you without \u2026\u201d Her voice broke. \u201cWe can talk about that\ntomorrow, too.\u201d\nBryce rinsed out the conditioner. And realized that her mother didn\u2019t\nknow\u2014about Micah. What she\u2019d done to him. Or what Micah had done to\nDanika.\nEmber kept talking, and Bryce kept listening, while dread grew like\nivy inside her, creeping through her veins, wrapping around her bones and\nsqueezing tight.\nHunt took a swift, icy shower of his own and changed into different clothes,\nsmiling slightly to himself as Bryce\u2019s shower shut off and she kept talking\nto her mother.\n\u201cYeah, Hunt\u2019s here.\u201d Her words floated down the hall, through the\ngreat room, and into his own room. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t, Mom. And no, he didn\u2019t,\neither.\u201d A drawer slammed. \u201cThat is none of your business, and please never\nask me anything like that again.\u201d\nHunt had a good idea of what Ember had asked her daughter. And\nwouldn\u2019t you know, he\u2019d been about to do just that with Bryce when she\u2019d\ncalled.\nHe hadn\u2019t cared that an entire city was looking on: he\u2019d wanted to kiss\nher when the light of her power had faded, when Hunt had lowered his\nwings to find her in his arms, looking up at him like he was worth\nsomething. Like he was all she needed. End of story.\nNo one had ever looked at him like that.\nAnd when they\u2019d come back here, and he\u2019d had her on his lap on her\nbed and seen the way her cheeks became pink as she looked at his mouth,\nhe\u2019d been ready to cross that final bridge with her. To spend all day and\nnight doing so.\nConsidering how her firstlight had healed him, he\u2019d most definitely\nsay he was cleared for sex. Aching for it\u2014for her.\nBryce groaned. \u201cYou\u2019re a pervert, Mom. You know that?\u201d She\ngrowled. \u201cWell, if you\u2019re so fucking invested in it, why did you call me?\nDidn\u2019t you think I might be busy?\u201d\nHunt smiled, going half-hard again at the sass in her tone. He could\nlisten to her snark all fucking day. He wondered how much of it would\nmake an appearance when he got her naked again. Got her moaning.\nThe first time, she\u2019d come on his hand. This time \u2026 This time, he had\nplans for all the other ways he\u2019d get her to make that beautiful, breathless\nsound as she\u2019d orgasmed.\nLeaving Bryce to deal with her mother, willing his cock to calm the\nfuck down, Hunt grabbed a burner phone from his underwear drawer and\ndialed Isaiah, one of the few numbers he\u2019d memorized.\n\u201cThank the fucking gods,\u201d Isaiah said when he heard Hunt\u2019s voice.\nHunt smiled at the male\u2019s uncharacteristic relief. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening\non your end?\u201d\n\u201cMy end?\u201d Isaiah barked a laugh. \u201cWhat the fuck is happening on your\nend?\u201d\nToo much to say. \u201cAre you at the Comitium?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, and it\u2019s a gods-damned madhouse. I just realized I\u2019m in charge\nnow.\u201d\nWith Micah a bunch of ashes in a vacuum and Sandriel not much\nbetter, Isaiah, as Micah\u2019s Commander of the 33rd, was indeed in charge.\n\u201cCongrats on the promotion, man.\u201d\n\u201cPromotion my ass. I\u2019m not an Archangel. And these assholes know\nit.\u201d Isaiah snapped at someone in the background, \u201cThen call fucking\nmaintenance to clean it up.\u201d He sighed.\nHunt asked, \u201cWhat happened to the Asterian fuckheads who sent their\nbrimstone over the walls?\u201d He had half a mind to fly out there and start\nunleashing his lightning on those tanks.\n\u201cGone. Already moved off.\u201d Isaiah\u2019s dark tone told Hunt he\u2019d be down\nfor some good old-fashioned retribution, too.\nHunt asked, bracing himself, \u201cNaomi?\u201d\n\u201cAlive.\u201d Hunt uttered a silent prayer of thanks to Cthona for that\nmercy. Then Isaiah said, \u201cLook, I know you\u2019re exhausted, but can you get\nover here? I could use your help to sort this shit out. All these pissing\ncontests will end pretty damn fast if they see us both in charge.\u201d\nHunt tried not to bristle. Bryce and him getting naked, it seemed,\nwould have to wait.\nBecause the slave tattoo on his wrist meant he still had to obey the\nRepublic, still belonged to someone other than himself. The list of\npossibilities wasn\u2019t good. He\u2019d be lucky if he got to stay in Lunathion as the\npossession of whoever took Micah\u2019s spot, and maybe see Bryce in stolen\nmoments. If he was even allowed outside the Comitium.\nFuck, if they even allowed him to live after what he\u2019d done to Sandriel.\nHunt\u2019s hands began to shake. Any trace of arousal vanished.\nBut he shrugged a shirt over his head. He\u2019d find some way to survive\n\u2014some way back to this life with Quinlan he\u2019d barely begun to savor.\nUnable to help himself, he glanced at his wrist.\nHe blinked once. Twice.\nBryce was just saying goodbye to her deviant mother when the phone\nbeeped with another call. It was from an unknown number, which meant it\nwas probably Jesiba, so Bryce promised Ember they\u2019d talk tomorrow and\nswitched over. \u201cHey.\u201d\nA young, male voice asked, \u201cIs that how you greet all your callers,\nBryce Quinlan?\u201d\nShe knew that voice. Knew the lanky teenage body it belonged to, a\nshell to house an ancient behemoth. To house an Asteri. She\u2019d seen and\nheard it on TV so many times she\u2019d lost count.\n\u201cHello, Your Brilliance,\u201d she whispered."}, "96": {"Name": "PART IV THE RAVINE-Chapter 96", "Page Content": " 6 \nRigelus, the Bright Hand of the Asteri, had called her house. Bryce\u2019s hands\nshook so badly she could barely keep the phone to her ear.\n\u201cWe beheld your actions today and wished to extend our gratitude,\u201d\nthe lilting voice said.\nShe swallowed, wondering if the mightiest of the Asteri somehow\nknew she was standing in a towel, hair dripping onto the carpet. \u201cYou\u2019re \u2026\nwelcome?\u201d\nRigelus laughed softly. \u201cYou have had quite a day, Miss Quinlan.\u201d\n\u201cYes, Your Brilliance.\u201d\n\u201cIt was a day full of many surprises, for all of us.\u201d\nWe know what you are, what you did.\nBryce forced her legs to move, to head to the great room. To where\nHunt was standing in the doorway of his bedroom, his face pale. His arms\nslack at his sides.\n\u201cTo show you how deep our gratitude goes, we would like to grant you\na favor.\u201d\nShe wondered if the brimstone had been a favor, too. But she said,\n\u201cThat\u2019s not necessary\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt is already done. We trust you will find it satisfactory.\u201d\nShe knew Hunt could hear the voice on the line as he walked over.\nBut he just held out his wrist. His tattooed wrist, with a C stamped\nover the slave\u2019s mark.\nFreed.\n\u201cI \u2026\u201d Bryce gripped Hunt\u2019s wrist, then scanned his face. But it was\nnot joy she saw there\u2014not as he heard the voice on the line and understood\nwho had gifted him his freedom.\n\u201cWe also trust that this favor will serve as a reminder for you and Hunt\nAthalar. It is our deepest wish that you remain in the city, and live out your\ndays in peace and contentment. That you use your ancestors\u2019 gift to bring\nyourself joy. And refrain from using the other gift inked upon you.\u201d\nUse your starlight as a party trick and never, ever use the Horn.\nIt made her the biggest idiot in Midgard, but she said, \u201cWhat about\nMicah and Sandriel?\u201d\n\u201cGovernor Micah went rogue and threatened to destroy innocent\ncitizens of this empire with his high-handed approach to the rebel conflict.\nGovernor Sandriel got what she deserved in being so lax with her control\nover her slaves.\u201d\nFear gleamed in Hunt\u2019s eyes. In her own, too, Bryce was sure. Nothing\nwas ever this easy\u2014this simple. There had to be a catch.\n\u201cThese are, of course, sensitive issues, Miss Quinlan. Ones that, were\nthey publicly announced, would result in a great deal of trouble for all\ninvolved.\u201d\nFor you. We will destroy you.\n\u201cAll the witnesses to both events have been notified of the potential\nfallout.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Bryce whispered.\n\u201cAnd as for the unfortunate destruction of Lunathion, we do accept full\nresponsibility. We were informed by Sandriel that the city had been\nevacuated, and sent the Asterian Guard to wipe away the demon infestation.\nThe brimstone missiles were a last resort, intended to save us all. It was\nincredibly fortunate that you found a solution.\u201d\nLiar. Ancient, awful liar. He\u2019d picked the perfect scapegoat: a dead\none. The rage that flickered over Hunt\u2019s face told her he shared her opinion.\n\u201cI was truly lucky,\u201d Bryce managed to say.\n\u201cYes, perhaps because of the power in your veins. Such a gift can have\ntremendous consequences, if not handled wisely.\u201d A pause, as if he were\nsmiling. \u201cI trust you shall learn to wield both your unexpected strength and\nthe light within you with \u2026 discretion.\u201d\nStay in your lane.\n\u201cI will,\u201d Bryce murmured.\n\u201cGood,\u201d Rigelus said. \u201cAnd do you believe it necessary that I contact\nyour mother, Ember Quinlan, to ask for her discretion, too?\u201d The threat\ngleamed, sharp as a knife. One step out of line, and they knew where to\nstrike first. Hunt\u2019s hands curled into fists.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Bryce said. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know about the Governors.\u201d\n\u201cAnd she never will. No one else will ever know, Bryce Quinlan.\u201d\nBryce swallowed again. \u201cYes.\u201d\nA soft laugh. \u201cThen you and Hunt Athalar have our blessing.\u201d\nThe line went dead. Bryce stared at the phone like it was going to\nsprout wings and fly around the room.\nHunt slumped on the couch, rubbing his face. \u201cLive quietly and\nnormally, keep your mouths shut, never use the Horn, and we won\u2019t fucking\nkill you and everyone you love.\u201d\nBryce sat on the rolled arm of the couch. \u201cSlay a few enemies, gain\ntwice as many in return.\u201d Hunt grunted. She angled her head. \u201cWhy are\nyour boots on?\u201d\n\u201cIsaiah needs me at the Comitium. He\u2019s up to his neck in angels\nwanting to challenge his authority and needs backup.\u201d He arched a brow.\n\u201cWant to come play Scary Asshole with me?\u201d\nDespite everything, despite the Asteri watching and all that had\noccurred, Bryce smiled. \u201cI have just the outfit.\u201d\nBryce and Hunt made it two steps onto the roof before she caught the\nfamiliar scent. Peered over the edge and saw who ran down the street\nbelow. A glance at Hunt, and he swept her into his arms, flying her down to\nthe sidewalk. She might have snuck a deep inhale of him, her nose grazing\nthe strong column of his neck.\nHunt\u2019s caress down her spine a moment before he set her down told\nher he\u2019d caught that little sniff. But then Bryce was standing before Ruhn.\nBefore Fury and Tristan Flynn.\nFury barely gave her a moment before she leapt upon Bryce, hugging\nher so tightly her bones groaned. \u201cYou are one lucky idiot,\u201d Fury said,\nlaughing softly. \u201cAnd one smart bitch.\u201d\nBryce smiled, her laugh caught in her throat as Fury pulled away. But a\nthought struck her, and Bryce reached for her phone\u2014no, it was left\nsomewhere in this city. \u201cJuniper\u2014\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s safe. I\u2019m going to check on her now.\u201d Fury squeezed her hand\nand then nodded to Hunt. \u201cWell done, angel.\u201d And then her friend was\nsprinting off, blending into the night itself.\nBryce turned back to Ruhn and Flynn. The latter just gaped at her. But\nBryce looked to her brother, wholly still and silent. His clothes torn enough\nto tell her that before the firstlight had healed everything, he\u2019d been in bad\nshape. Had probably fought his way through this city.\nThen Ruhn began babbling. \u201cTharion went off to help get the evacuees\nout of the Blue Court, and Amelie ran to the Den to make sure the pups\nwere okay, but we were nearly \u2026 we were half a mile away when I heard\nthe Moonwood Gate. Heard you talking through it, I mean. There were so\nmany demons I couldn\u2019t get there, but then I heard Danika, and all that light\nerupted and \u2026\u201d He halted, swallowing hard. His blue eyes gleamed in the\nstreetlights, dawn still far off. A breeze off the Istros ruffled his black hair.\nAnd it was the tears that filled his eyes, the wonder in them, that had Bryce\nlaunching forward. Had her throwing her arms around her brother and\nholding him tightly.\nRuhn didn\u2019t hesitate before his arms came around her. He shook so\nbadly that she knew he was crying.\nA scuff of steps told her Flynn was giving them privacy; a cedar-\nscented breeze flitting past suggested that Hunt had gone airborne to wait\nfor her.\n\u201cI thought you were dead,\u201d Ruhn said, his voice shaking as much as\nhis body. \u201cLike ten fucking times, I thought you were dead.\u201d\nShe chuckled. \u201cI\u2019m glad to disappoint you.\u201d\n\u201cShut up, Bryce.\u201d He scanned her face, his cheeks wet. \u201cAre you \u2026\nare you all right?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she admitted. Concern flared in his face, but she didn\u2019t\ndare give any specifics, not after Rigelus\u2019s phone call. Not with all the\ncameras around. Ruhn gave her a knowing grimace. Yes, they\u2019d talk about\nthat strange, ancient starlight within her veins later. What it meant for both\nof them. \u201cThank you for coming for me.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re my sister.\u201d Ruhn didn\u2019t bother to keep his voice down. No,\nthere was pride in his voice. And damn if that didn\u2019t hit her in the heart. \u201cOf\ncourse I\u2019d come to save your ass.\u201d\nShe punched his arm, but Ruhn\u2019s smile turned tentative. \u201cDid you\nmean what you said to Athalar? About me?\u201d Tell Ruhn I forgive him.\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said without a moment of hesitation. \u201cI meant all of it.\u201d\n\u201cBryce.\u201d His face grew grave. \u201cYou really thought that I would care\nmore about the Starborn shit than about you? You honestly think I care\nwhich one of us it is?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s both of us,\u201d she said. \u201cThose books you read said such things\nonce happened.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit,\u201d he said, smiling slightly. \u201cI don\u2019t care if I\u2019m\ncalled Prince or Starborn or the Chosen One or any of that.\u201d He grabbed her\nhand. \u201cThe only thing I want to be called right now is your brother.\u201d He\nadded softly, \u201cIf you\u2019ll have me.\u201d\nShe winked, even as her heart tightened unbearably. \u201cI\u2019ll think about\nit.\u201d\nRuhn grinned before his face turned grave once more. \u201cYou know the\nAutumn King will want to meet with you. Be ready.\u201d\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t getting a bunch of fancy-ass power mean I don\u2019t have to\nobey anyone? And just because I forgive you doesn\u2019t mean I forgive him.\u201d\nShe would never do that.\n\u201cI know.\u201d Ruhn\u2019s eyes gleamed. \u201cBut you need to be on your guard.\u201d\nShe arched a brow, tucking away the warning, and said, \u201cHunt told me\nabout the mind-reading.\u201d He\u2019d mentioned it briefly\u2014along with a recap of\nthe Summit and everything that had gone down\u2014on the walk up to the\nroof.\nRuhn glared at the adjacent rooftop where Hunt stood. \u201cAthalar has a\nbig fucking mouth.\u201d\nOne she\u2019d like to put to good use on various part of her body, she\ndidn\u2019t say. She didn\u2019t need Ruhn puking on her clean clothes.\nRuhn went on, \u201cAnd it\u2019s not mind-reading. Just \u2026 mind-talking.\nTelepathy.\u201d\n\u201cDoes dear old Dad know?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d And then her brother said into her head, And I\u2019d like to keep it\nthat way.\nShe started. Creepy. Kindly stay the fuck out of my head, brother.\nGladly. His phone rang, and he glanced at the screen before wincing.\n\u201cI gotta take this.\u201d\nRight, because they all had work to do to get this city to rights\u2014\nstarting with tending to the dead. The sheer number of Sailings would be \u2026\nshe didn\u2019t want to think about it.\nRuhn let the phone ring again. \u201cCan I come over tomorrow?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said, smirking. \u201cI\u2019ll get your name added to the guest list.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah, you\u2019re a fucking hotshot.\u201d He rolled his eyes and\nanswered the call. \u201cHey, Dec.\u201d He strode down the street to where Flynn\nwaited, throwing Bryce a parting grin.\nBryce looked to the rooftop across the street. Where the angel still\nwaited for her, a shadow against the night.\nBut no longer the Shadow of Death."}, "97": {"Name": "PART IV THE RAVINE-Chapter 97", "Page Content": " 7 \nHunt stayed at the Comitium barracks that night. Bryce had lost track of the\nhours they\u2019d worked, first through the night, then into the cloudless day,\nand finally at sunset she\u2019d been dragging so much that he\u2019d ordered Naomi\nto fly her home. And presumably ordered her to stand watch, since a dark-\nwinged figure still stood on the adjacent rooftop in the gray light before\ndawn, and a peek into Hunt\u2019s room revealed that his bed remained made.\nBut Bryce didn\u2019t dwell on all the work they\u2019d done yesterday, or all\nthat lay ahead. Reorganizing the city\u2019s leadership, Sailings for the dead, and\nwaiting for the big announcement: which Archangel would be tapped by the\nAsteri to rule over Valbara.\nOdds of them being decent were slim to none, but Bryce didn\u2019t dwell\non that, either, as she slipped into the still-dim streets, Syrinx tugging on his\nleash as she tucked her new phone into her pocket. She\u2019d defied the odds\nyesterday, so maybe the gods would throw them another bone and convince\nthe Asteri to send someone who wasn\u2019t a psychopath.\nAt the very least, there would be no more death bargains for Hunt.\nNothing more to atone for. No, he would be a free and true member of the\ntriarii, if he wished. He had yet to decide.\nBryce waved to Naomi, and the angel waved back. She\u2019d been too\ntired yesterday to object to having a guard, since Hunt didn\u2019t trust the\nAsteri, her father, or any other power brokers to stay the Hel away. After\nletting Syrinx do his business, she shook her head when the chimera made\nto turn back toward the apartment. \u201cNo breakfast yet, buddy,\u201d she said,\naiming for the river.\nSyrinx yowled with displeasure, but trotted along, sniffing at\neverything in his path until the broad band of the Istros appeared, its\nriverside walkway empty at this early hour. Tharion had called her\nyesterday, promising the River Queen\u2019s full support for any resources she\nneeded.\nBryce hadn\u2019t the nerve to ask whether that support was due to her\nbeing the bastard daughter of the Autumn King, a Starborn Fae, or the\nbearer of Luna\u2019s Horn. Perhaps all of them.\nBryce settled onto one of the wooden benches along the quay, the\nBone Quarter a swirling, misty wall across the water. The mer had come\u2014\nhad helped so many escape. Even the otters had grabbed the smallest of the\ncity\u2019s residents and carried them down to the Blue Court. The House of\nMany Waters had risen to the occasion. The shifters had risen to it.\nBut the Fae \u2026 FiRo had sustained the least damage. The Fae had\nsuffered the fewest casualties. It was no surprise, when their shields had\nbeen the first to go up. And had not opened to allow anyone inside.\nBryce blocked out the thought as Syrinx leapt onto the bench beside\nher, nails clicking on the wood, and plopped his furry butt next to hers.\nBryce slid her phone from her pocket and wrote to Juniper, Tell Madame\nKyrah I\u2019ll be at her next dance class.\nJune wrote back almost immediately. The city was attacked and this is\nwhat you\u2019re thinking about? A few seconds later she added, But I will.\nBryce smiled. For long minutes, she and Syrinx sat in silence,\nwatching the light bleed to gray, then to the palest blue. And then a golden\nthread of light appeared along the Istros\u2019s calm surface.\nBryce unlocked her phone. And read Danika\u2019s final, happy messages\none last time.\nThe light built on the river, gilding its surface.\nBryce\u2019s eyes stung as she smiled softly, then read through Connor\u2019s\nlast words to her.\nMessage me when you\u2019re home safe.\nBryce began typing. The answer it had taken her two years, nearly to\nthe day, to write.\nI\u2019m home.\nShe sent the message into the ether, willed it to find its way across the\ngilded river and to the misty isle beyond.\nAnd then she deleted the thread. Deleted Danika\u2019s messages, too. Each\nswipe of her finger had her heart lightening, lifting with the rising sun.\nWhen they were gone, when she had set them free, she stood, Syrinx\nleaping to the pavement beside her. She made to turn home, but a glimmer\nof light across the river caught her eye.\nFor a heartbeat, just one, the dawn parted the mists of the Bone\nQuarter. Revealing a grassy shore. Rolling, serene hills beyond. Not a land\nof stone and gloom, but of light and green. And standing on that lovely\nshore, smiling at her \u2026\nA gift from the Under-King for saving the city.\nTears began rolling down her face as she beheld the near-invisible\nfigures. All six of them\u2014the seventh gone forever, having yielded her\neternity. But the tallest of them, standing in the middle with his hand lifted\nin greeting \u2026\nBryce brought her hand to her mouth, blowing a gentle kiss.\nAs swiftly as they parted, the mists closed. But Bryce kept smiling, all\nthe way back to the apartment. Her phone buzzed, and Hunt\u2019s message\npopped up. I\u2019m home. Where are you?\nShe could barely type as Syrinx tugged her along. Walking Syrinx. I\u2019ll\nbe there in a minute.\nGood. I\u2019m making breakfast.\nBryce\u2019s grin nearly split her face in two as she hurried her steps,\nSyrinx launching into a flat-out sprint. As if he, too, knew what awaited\nthem. Who awaited them.\nThere was an angel in her apartment. Which meant it must be any\ngods-damned day of the week. Which meant she had joy in her heart, and\nher eyes set on the wide-open road ahead."}}}
